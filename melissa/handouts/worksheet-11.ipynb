    "## Lesson Objectives\n",
    "Earn your Python “learner’s permit”\n",
    "Work with Pandas, the DataFrame package\n",
    "Recognize differences between R and Python\n",
    "Hit the autubahn with Scikit-learn\n",
    "Specific Achievements\n",
    "Differentiate between data types and structures\n",
    "Learn to use indentation as syntax\n",
    "Import data and try a simple “split-apply-combine”\n",
    "Implement a SVM for binary classification\n",
    "Why learn Python? While much of the academic research community has dived into R for an open source toolbox for data science, there are plenty of reasons to learn Python too. Some find they can learn to write scripts more quickly in Python, others find its object orientation a real boon. This lesson works towards a simple “machine learning” problem, which has long been a speciality of Python’s Scikit-learn package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine Learning is another take on regression (for continuous response) and classification (for categorical response).\n",
    "\n",
    "Emphasis on prediction over parameter inference\n",
    "Equal emphasis on probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods: whatever works\n",
    "Not necessarilly “supervised” (e.g. clustering)\n",
    "This lesson will step through a non-probabilistic classifier, because it’s at far end of the spectrum relative to generalized linear regression. Some classification methods have probabilistic interpretations: logistic regression is actually a classifier, whether or not you follow through to choosing the most likely outcome or are satisfied with estimating its probability. Others optimize the classifier based on other abstract quantities: SVMs maximize the distance between the “support vectors”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter\n",
    "Sign into JupyterHub and open up worksheet-11.ipynb. This worksheet is an Jupyter Notebook document: it is divided into “cells” that are run independently but access the same Python interpreter. Use the Notebook to write and annotate code.\n",
