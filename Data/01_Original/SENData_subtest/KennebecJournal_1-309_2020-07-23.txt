Opponents of Maquoit Bay expansion intend to appeal in court

BRUNSWICK — The Department of Marine Resources approved the controversial expansion of Maquoit Bay’s Mere Point Oyster Co. on Thursday, ending more than a year’s worth of debate and waiting over the 40-acre farm.
The new lease is expected to increase the company’s operating space by nearly 160 times, from roughly ¼-acre of Limited Purpose Aquaculture sites to about 40 acres of professional oyster harvesting, of which 12 acres are designated as navigable corridors. The company’s annual harvest would increase from 60,000 last year to 1.5 million in the next three years, with as many as 5 million oysters in the water at a given time.
A marathon hearing on Mere Point Oyster Co.’s proposed 10-year lease started in November 2018 and wrapped up in mid-January 2019. Waterfront property owners and lobster fishermen spoke out against what they saw as conflicting uses of the bay and the potential infringement on valuable lobstering grounds.
Two groups opposed to the expansion were granted limited intervenor status: One is a group of lobster fishermen, and the other a group of Brunswick residents, largely from Mere Point, known as both the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group and the Concerned Citizens of Maquoit Bay.
During the hearings, many witnesses expressed concern for lobstermen who previously testified that the lease would infringe upon valuable fishing grounds and result in a loss of revenue, though the department found that lobster sightings were rare during the site scoping session.
The department had 120 days to make a ruling, but according to Jeff Nichols, director of communications for the department of marine resources, it was a “more complicated lease application than normal.”
In late September, officials issued a draft approval which dismissed many of the intervenor’s concerns, including that the lease would interfere with lobstering grounds, negatively impact eelgrass beds, prevent navigation and recreation, and result in too much noise. They also found no conflict of interest with Devereaux, who is harbormaster and a former marine resources officer, because other town officials reviewed the material.
Co-owners Dan Devereaux and Doug Niven are pleased with “rational decision” from the department, Devereaux said, but despite their relief at what they see as a positive conclusion to a lengthy process, “our personal journey is far from over.”
“We have to maintain our sense of being good stewards to the ocean and good neighbors to the neighbors … We want to continue being the representatives of aquaculture that we envision ourselves to be,” he said, adding, “I think we will be scrutinized for a time to come.”
The decision, a “precedent-setting case for Maine,” will be appealed in court, said Crystal Canney, spokeswoman for the concerned citizens of Maquoit Bay.
The opposition met the “unreasonable interference criteria to have this application denied,” she said in a written statement, “but DMR favored aquaculture at the expense of the traditional fisheries.”
Canney also said that despite significant concerns, the department ignored the permitting rules (a process she called “severely broken”) and the will of the people in favor of “a wealthy aquaculture investor and Brunswick’s Harbormaster who has serious conflicts of interest in the project.”
Peter Vaughn, a member of Mere Point Preservation Group, said he was “disappointed” in the decision, “which essentially gives exclusive access to acres of ocean to those who will profit by their use or sale, while keeping away those who fish, boat or just live beside those waters.” He and others will continue to oppose the decision, he added.
Devereaux though, said he thinks the decision “is good for aquaculture and good for Maine.”
The approval is “encouraging,” he said, and while it took a long time (almost two years since the time they submitted their application, he said), the case supports how well-vetted the process is.
“The DMR is looking at every aspect and every angle,” he said. “People need to respect that process.”
He hopes the opposition will rethink their decision to appeal, but feels Mere Point Oyster Co. stands a good chance, especially given how much time and effort has been invested in making sure their application was sound.
Mere Point Oyster Co. will continue harvesting over the winter, but will not move gear to the site until the spring. Once they are settled, Devereaux thinks people will realize the site, which was often called “factory” during the hearings, is not that different from the Limited Purpose Aquaculture sites they already have.
“Change is hard, it happens over time, not overnight,” he said. “We’re excited and ready to go … I’m sure there will still be some sleepless nights, … but we’re not going away.”

Full text: The Gulf of Maine 2050 International Symposium is aimed at sharing the latest science on ocean acidification as well as rising sea levels and ocean temperatures while encouraging more collaboration between New England and the Canadian Maritimes.
Several hundred scientists, conservationists and government leaders from New England and the Canadian Maritimes are gathering in Portland to discuss the rapid ecological changes in the Gulf of Maine and how the region should respond.
The Gulf of Maine 2050 International Symposium will focus on the science of sea level rise, ocean acidification, warming ocean waters and how those climate-related changes will affect the regional economy, environment and population over the next three decades.
“Preparing for 2050 is a major challenge, but it is one that we won’t face alone,” said Theresa Torrent of the Maine Department of Marine Resources Maine Coastal Program and the state’s coordinator on the international Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment.
“The purpose of Gulf of Maine 2050 is to activate the talents of people around the Gulf of Maine and build a safe and productive future.”
The conference — hosted by the Gulf of Maine Council, the Portland-based Gulf of Maine Research Institute and the Huntsman Marine Science Centre in St. Andrews, New Brunswick — comes at a time when New England’s waters and forests are already experiencing dramatic changes.
Another goal of the gathering, however, is to foster collaboration among states and provinces at a time when President Donald Trump is increasingly isolating the United States from the international community on climate issues.
As scientists gathered Monday at the Westin Harborview Hotel in Portland, the Trump administration followed through on its pledge to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord.
By notifying the United Nations of the its plans to withdraw from the agreement, the Trump administration is walking away from the international goals set to avoid an additional global temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius.
Speaking hours before the Trump administration’s announcement, Maine Gov. Janet Mills recalled how earlier this year her administration joined the U.S. Climate Alliance coalition of 24 states that are committed to the goals of the Paris climate accord “no matter what happens in Washington.”
Mills, who made action on climate change a cornerstone of her 2018 gubernatorial campaign, has set a goal of achieving carbon neutrality in Maine by 2045, and of reducing Maine’s greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050.
“Our administration believes in science,” Mills said during the conference’s opening remarks. “We share a love of our great state’s natural resources, outdoor recreation and coastal communities, all of which are threatened by climate change.”
While the political debate over climate change continues in some sectors, the Gulf of Maine is already experiencing significant changes.
The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than almost every other area of ocean around the globe, according research by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and other scientists. And those changes have major ecological implications.
Colder-water species such as cod are moving north or into deeper waters while warmer-water species, such as black bass, are moving into the gulf. The gulf is also becoming increasingly acidic as the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which can impede shell formation by lobsters, scallops, clams and other shellfish.
Last week, Maine fisheries regulators announced that lobster landings were down 40 percent this year compared to 2018 and down 38 percent from the five-year average. During her speech, Mills said a long-predicted end to the so-called “lobster boom” would have a “devastating” impact on Maine’s commercial fishing industry and that other Maine fisheries are threatened by acidification or invasive species.
“The antidote to this lies in climate, ocean and ocean-species science — which so many of you bring to this conference today and tomorrow — which will better form the basis of public policy that is driven by reason and research, and not rhetoric,” Mills said.
Globally, sea levels rose 3 inches between 1993 and 2017 and continue to rise at a rate of roughly one-eighth of an inch annually as glaciers melt and seawater expands thermally as it warms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That is roughly double the rate for much of the 20th century.
Additionally, global temperatures already have risen roughly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial levels. The Paris climate agreement called on member nations to work toward goals to holding future temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a level that reports from the United Nations’ International Panel on Climate Change have suggested could avoid some of the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.
Ko Barrett, a deputy assistant administrator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who has served as vice chair of International Panel on Climate Change, told Monday’s conference the world is projected to hit that 1.5-degree mark between 2030 and 2052 at the current pace. But Barrett said “the good news is we are not yet committed to a 1.5-degree world.”
“While not impossible, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees is a monumental task that would require rapid, unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society — transitions like we are seeing in the energy sector, only faster and in many different sectors simultaneously,” Barrett said.
Over the next three days, conference attendees will share their scientific research into sea level rise, ocean acidification and ocean temperature rise in the Gulf of Maine. Organizers also will be awarding “mini-grants” to research proposals that spring from conversations at the conference. Rachel Cleetus, policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told attendees scientists must do a better job of communicating how a changing climate affects the health, lives and economics of everyday people.
Cleetus also said state action on climate change has become “a beacon of hope” amid federal inaction on the climate crisis. Addressing the bigger issues will require dramatic changes to cleaner sources in electricity generation and the transportation sector, as well as protecting the “carbon sinks,” such as forests, that lock up carbon dioxide.
“It’s going to require some pretty fundamental shifts in how we make our investments in the power sector,” Cleetus said. “And the important part here is that Maine is setting a course that will work not just for Maine, but could be an example elsewhere in the nation and globally.”

Business, education leaders call for greater post-secondary opportunities for students
LEWISTON — For businesses, the growing shortage of qualified workers in Maine has become a problem that threatens to stifle the economy in the nation’s oldest state.
But for young people with vision, it offers an amazing opportunity, educators and company executives told students Tuesday at the Lewiston Regional Technical Center.
“The world is your oyster here in Maine,” said Deanne Sherman, chief executive officer of Dead River Co. and chairwoman of Educate Maine’s board of directors.
A number of business and education leaders who gathered to speak with students enrolled in the Bridge Academy Maine program called for investing in programs that will help high school students transition directly into college or technical programs that will prepare them for jobs.
Emma Williams, who is in her first year at the University of Maine at Farmington, said that signing up for the Bridge Academy program at Lewiston High School prepared her for college and let her rack up 26 credits before she arrived for her freshman year.
“It saved me a lot of time and money,” the aspiring teacher said.
Brian Langley, executive director of the Bridge Academy program, called Emma Williams “a concrete example” of the good it can do.
Her mother, Jen Williams, said the program provided a huge advantage for her daughter because it offered college credit and because she learned skills, such as time management and how to study properly.
It also provided her the confidence to plunge ahead, the mother said.
Jen Williams said her son, David, a junior at Lewiston, got interested in the program, too, because he saw what it had done for his sister. He plans to become an electrician after graduation.
It is “a really good fit” for her children, Williams said, and highly recommended as a way of having youngsters stay local and develop the skills to earn a living.
Sherman said the bottom line is that by 2025, if current trends hold, Maine will find itself short of 158,000 workers who have the skills or credentials to fill expected jobs in the state.
In short, she said, as the population grows ever older, “more job opportunities will be created than there are workers to fill them.”
In six years, Sherman said, the state needs to ensure that 60% of its working adults have the necessary post-high school credentials. Only 46% of them possess those skills now, a bit less than the national average, she said.
“Maine is experiencing a serious skills gap,” Langley said.
Jason Judd, executive director of Educate Maine, said the looming dearth of qualified workers “could be devastating to Maine.”
He said “forceful action” to bolster the number of people with the credentials they need is the only answer to keeping the state’s economy humming.
To hasten the required transformation, Sherman said, Maine needs programs like the Bridge Academy and The Green Ladle program in Lewiston, which teaches students everything about running a restaurant.
“It is an urgent issue,” she said, insisting Maine needs “to build a talent pool to meet our business needs.”
In a report issued Tuesday, Educate Maine said by 2025, the school and young working adult population “is projected to decline as the retiree population drastically increases.”
“The ratio of senior citizens to working adults in Maine will increase 93% by 2030,” much higher than the anticipated rise nationally, the report said.
That rapid aging, which is nearly inevitable unless Maine attracts far more immigrants than expected from other states and countries, will lead to more jobs “being created than workers to fill them.”
Langley said the Bridge Academy is a collaboration among teachers, business and academia that allows a “whole team of adults” to focus on the students participating in the program. It helps them get both the education and skills to shine on the job, he said.
Its students, he said, are prepared “for these really great-paying jobs” of the future.
Judd said workforce development programs that boost students are crucial for economic progress in Maine.
“That is the challenge of our generation,” he said.

Full text: Maine's governor meets with European climate leaders, Brazilian regional officials and other U.S. governors to discuss how states can help the nation meet Paris climate targets.
Gov. Janet Mills said that while she was at the United Nations Climate Summit on Monday she found herself standing near President Trump’s new U.N. ambassador, Kelly Kraft, and feeling the pain of foreign delegates at the meeting.
Kraft, who is married to a billionaire coal magnate Joe Crafts II of Alliance Resource Partners, has $63 million personally invested in fossil fuel interests, according to her financial disclosures, a fact Mills said she found troubling.
“To think she represents our country in the U.N. while we’re talking about climate change,” Maine’s governor said Tuesday via telephone from New York. “So you can understand other countries’ frustrations when trying to deal with the federal government and why they are looking to the states to work together to save our common planet.”
Mills, who on Monday was the only U.S. elected official to speak at the climate summit, spent Tuesday meeting with foreign officials and fellow U.S. governors on the sidelines of the meeting, looking to share ideas and best practices.
Tuesday morning she met with five high-ranking European climate officials alongside Washington Gov. Jay Inslee – a Democrat who recently withdrew from the presidential race after campaigning almost solely on climate change – and Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board.
The participants made no public statements, but Mills told the Press Herald she’d learned about Scandinavian experiences electrifying ferries and Scotland’s large offshore wind sector, while she talked about Maine’s sustainable forest practices and the floating wind platforms being developed at the University of Maine. Her spokeswoman, Lindsay Crete, said participants also reaffirmed their commitments to meet Paris Climate Accord goals and had discussed “trying to raise global ambitions” ahead of the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, where 30,000 delegates will meet in another attempt to craft an international response to the climate crisis.
The European delegation consisted of three top European Union officials: Olva Elvestuen, the E.U. minister for climate and the environment; Maura Petriccione, director general of the European Commission’s Climate Action Directorate; and Miguel Arias Canete, E.U. commissioner for energy and climate action. The United Kingdom’s special envoy for climate, Nick Bridge, and Anders Hoffman, an official at Denmark’s Climate, Energy, and Utilities Ministry, also attended the meeting, which was held at the offices of the E.U.’s diplomatic delegation to the U.N.
The meeting was convened by the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 states and Puerto Rico that seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accord with the Paris climate treaty that was created after President Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in 2017. Maine did not join the group until Feb. 28 of this year, after Mills replaced Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who did not favor robust action on climate change.
Crete said E.U. officials at the meeting had “expressed gratitude” to their American counterpart for creating the U.S. Climate Alliance, saying the “coalition of states was a powerful force despite the lack of action out of the White House.”
Mills said she also met Tuesday with counterparts from some of the northeastern states of Brazil who, like her, oppose the backpedaling on climate by their federal government.
Like Trump, Brazil’s new leader, Jair Bolsonaro, does not consider climate change a priority; he is accused of tacitly encouraging the recent fires in the Amazon rain forest, which he would like to see opened to development.
On Monday, Mills was the only U.S. elected official to address the U.N. general Assembly’ at the Climate Action Summit, and announced she had signed an executive order directing the Maine Climate Council – a body she created with legislative approval – to provide recommendations on how to make the state a carbon neutral economy by 2045, an initiative that follows previous recent commitments to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades.
From the podium, she told world leaders that Maine will not wait to take bold action to address climate change and challenged them to do the same.
“We’ve got to unite to preserve our precious common ground, for our common planet, in uncommon ways for this imperative common purpose,” she said. “Maine won’t wait. Will you?”
Mills said it had been “exciting just to be in the General Assembly room” speaking to delegates from around the world. “I felt very privileged to be there and honored that the State of Maine could be represented on the world stage.”
Mills attended another U.S. Climate Alliance event Tuesday afternoon: a panel discussion with five other Democratic governors on how states can address climate change. She was scheduled to appear alongside her counterparts from California (Gavin Newsom), Washington (Inslee), New Mexico (Michele Grisham), Virginia (Ralph Northam) and New Jersey (Phil Murphy).
The governor was scheduled to speak Tuesday evening in New York at the premier of a documentary film on how climate change is adversely affecting shellfish growers. The film, “Stories From the Shore,” was produced by the Nature Conservancy and the Shellfish Growers Climate Coalition, an alliance of dozens of shellfish mariculture operators seeking action on climate change.
Maine is at the forefront of climate change because the Gulf of Maine is the second fastest-warming part of the entire world’s oceans. The rapid warming, a side effect of climate change and the Arctic meltdown, is expected to have dramatic effects on the marine ecosystem and the communities that rely on it and is already adversely effecting clammers, aquaculture operations and the recovery of cod stocks.

Full text: She will be Maine's first sitting governor to speak before the international body's General Assembly.

Gov. Janet Mills will speak before the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday about Maine’s efforts to respond to climate change, becoming the first sitting Maine governor to address the international body.
The Democratic governor was invited to speak by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Mills’ office said Friday. She will deliver two minutes of remarks about her administration’s new action plan, which calls for an 80% reduction in the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; jump-starting renewable energy; and assessing and addressing sea level rise, ocean acidification and other impacts.
“This is a global threat that all states and all countries must confront together, and Maine will do its part,” Mills told the Press Herald in an email. “I look forward to standing before leaders of the world, sharing Maine’s significant achievements, and calling upon our national and international neighbors to step up and do their part in this critical fight for our future.”
Environmental groups are pleased the governor will be taking her message to the global stage. “We think it’s fantastic, and she’s earned a place on that platform,” said Pete Didisheim, advocacy director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, one of the state’s most influential environmental groups. “She’s made it clear she’s beyond just talk and that she’s about action and action based on science.”
Kate Dempsey, state director for The Nature Conservancy in Maine said her organization was pleased Mills was being recognized “as a national and global leader” on climate change. “The future of Maine’s communities and our natural places depends on moving toward a low-carbon future,” she said in a statement.
Mills’ remarks will take place amid the U.N. Climate Action Summit 2019, which is intended to bring government, private sector and international organizations together to develop aggressive plans to respond to the climate change threat.
Mills will remain in New York on Tuesday and meet with European Union officials to look for ways that the United States can work with European governments on climate issues. Later, she will join a panel discussion with five other Democratic governors to discuss state-level action to reduce U.S. greenhouse emissions in accordance with the Paris Climate Accord. President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement.
Tuesday evening, Mills will deliver opening remarks at the premiere of a short documentary film, “Shellfish Growers Changing the Game on Climate,” which features Maine oyster hatchery owner Bill Mook, who had to adapt his operations to cope with one of the side effects of climate change, ocean acidification.
Mills signed a climate action bill into law June 26 that requires Maine to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 45% below 1990 levels by 2030 and by at least 80% by 2050.
It created a 35-member Maine Climate Council tasked with developing specific plans to meet these goals, as well as monitoring the effects of ocean acidification, warming ocean temperatures, and changes in the salt and dissolved oxygen content of the gulf, an expected side effect of warming. The council — co-chaired by Hannah Pingree, director of governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, and Jerry Reid, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection — will have its first meeting Thursday in Hallowell.
“Climate change threatens all that we hold dear in Maine, from our fisheries, to our forests, to the very future of our beautiful state. With Washington’s failure to act, it’s now up to states like Maine to fight climate change head-on,” Mills said in the statement emailed to the Press Herald. “And we will not wait.”
Maine is at the forefront of climate change because the Gulf of Maine is the second fastest-warming part of the entire world ocean. The rapid warming, a side effect of climate change and the Arctic meltdown, is expected to have dramatic effects on the marine ecosystem and the communities that rely on it and is already adversely affecting clammers, aquaculture operations, and the recovery of cod stocks.
Former Maine Gov. Edmund S. Muskie spoke before the United Nations General Assembly while serving as Secretary of State in the Carter Administration, to rebuke the Soviet Union for its occupation of Afghanistan.

Full text: Portland has gained a national reputation as a city with great restaurants. What will be on the menu in 50 years if we do nothing to slow down climate change?

Ask Sam Hayward, co-owner and founding chef of Fore Street, what the famed Portland restaurant might be serving 50 years from now, and he obligingly jumps into an imaginary time capsule to visit 2069 and check out the menu.
The question assumes that little has been done since 2019 to put the brakes on climate change. It’s likely, Hayward says, that diners at his restaurant would be feasting on black sea bass, a mid-Atlantic species that already has started moving north into Gulf of Maine waters, or local meat raised on abundant Maine pastureland.
“As wild species become more threatened, fish farming will continue to grow, and shellfish farming will grow,” Hayward said. “So you’ll see even more bivalves on the menu, and possibly even some southern species, such as warm-water shrimp, being grown in different places. That’s hard to imagine, isn’t it?”
Farmers and fishermen are used to dealing with the vicissitudes of Mother Nature, but unchecked climate change may push her finicky personality into overdrive. Dramatic fluctuations in temperature and rainfall, increasingly acidic oceans, new plant and shellfish diseases and insect pests — all of these may challenge traditional notions of what farmers can grow in Maine and how they grow it, and what fishermen harvest from the sea. Even the smaller aspects of daily life — such as what you order off a menu — may look vastly different 50 years from now.
Chefs and scientists agree that they would need an actual crystal ball to be sure which meats, fish and vegetables will thrive and which will disappear as climate change transforms the planet. Climate change is a complex issue, and no one knows for certain how plants and animals will respond. For example, scientific models predict a general decline in groundfish such as cod, halibut, haddock and flounder, “but I think there’s some potential that haddock will fare better in the future just because they have these big (population) booms,” said Kathy Mills, a research scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute.
That means that in 2069, you may still be able to order a cup of your favorite fish chowder. But you might not be able to follow it up with the most iconic of Maine foods — a lobster. Lobster populations are at a historic high, but scientists warn that as the Gulf of Maine continues to warm, the population will decline, perhaps substantially. Lobster may be a splurge you save for birthdays and anniversaries.
“They’ll be much more of a luxury item, I think, if current trends continue,” Hayward said.
As the climate warms, Mainers likely will say goodbye to some familiar foods and learn to incorporate others into their diets. Cod won’t appear on your dinner plate unless it is flown in from Norway or Iceland. Acadian redfish, whose populations are thriving, or squid from southern New England waters may take its place. Beef, pork and lamb probably won’t disappear from restaurant menus, but could be locally raised or grown in a laboratory to avoid the big carbon footprint of factory farms (why we’re already being urged to eat less meat). Don’t worry about your Sunday brunch of blueberry pancakes slathered in maple syrup, with a side of hash browns. Blueberries, maple syrup and potatoes — all traditional Maine foods — probably aren’t going anywhere in the next 50 years, according to agricultural experts. (After that, we’ll need a bigger crystal ball.)
Before diving into menus, David Levi, chef/owner of Vinland, suggests asking which Portland neighborhoods will even have restaurants in 50 years. Parts of the city could be underwater because of sea level rise.
“If you’re making a reservation for Central Provisions in 2069, make sure you wear a wet suit,” Levi said. “Your galoshes might suffice for Vinland.”
Levi believes that in 50 years, the country will have less access to food from California and Latin America, areas expected to be ravaged by drought and fire, so Americans will be eating more seasonal, local foods. Maine is in a good position for that shift since we have a flourishing organic farming movement, he said.
“We’re already seeing some cutting-edge permaculture, growing things in Maine that people thought we couldn’t grow 20 or 30 years ago,” he said, citing figs and kiwis.
Mark Hutton, vegetable specialist and associate director of the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station in Orono, adds to that list foods such as baby ginger, sweet potatoes and artichokes, which are traditionally found in coastal California and Texas but are now being grown in Maine. But he says that improved farming techniques and farmers’ desire to develop new markets have more to do with the success of those unconventional crops than climate change. Climate, he said, “is probably not going to change what we grow. It may change when we grow it, or particularly when we can harvest it.
“Maybe we’ll be like Pennsylvania, where we have field tomatoes maturing in July rather than the end of August,” he said.
Hutton doesn’t think that any vegetable crops will disappear from Maine by 2069, but they may be more expensive to grow, primarily because of sharp fluctuations in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, and the challenges of dealing with new diseases and insect pests.
The same holds true for potatoes and blueberries. Those mashed potatoes on your plate at Fore Street will probably still come from Maine, but they may be a variety of potato that is less climate sensitive. And growing them may require irrigation or other costly special treatments, says Ellen Mallory, a professor of sustainable agriculture at the University of Maine. “We can adapt,” Mallory said. “The thing I feel like is (a challenge) is the increase in variability of the weather.
“We’ve already seen a dramatic increase in heavy precipitation. The number of extreme rainfall events has increased 74 percent since the 1950s. It’s hard to predict the specific impacts, but we know that just makes the farmers’ job harder.”
Blueberries are resilient plants, so you’ll still be able to order a big, juicy slice of blueberry pie for dessert, according to Lily Calderwood, a wild blueberry specialist and an assistant professor of horticulture at the University of Maine. Over the past 30 years, with spring arriving earlier and fall later, the wild blueberry growing season has been extended by about four weeks, she said. And fewer late spring frosts Down East mean that blueberries grow more reliably in fields north of Route 9, Calderwood said.
But like farmers growing vegetable crops, blueberry growers will be fighting new pests and may have to install irrigation systems to fight drought and plump up berries before harvest.
As for maple syrup, it’s true that sugar maples in southern parts of the state may lose ground to species such as red oak and white pine. And smaller maple producers may decide that year-to-year fluctuations in production aren’t worth it anymore, said Andy Whitman, director of the sustainable economies program at Manomet in Brunswick. But he thinks the trees still will be abundant in northern Maine, where the big commercial operations are located. “There will still be significant maple production in Maine,” Whitman said. “It may not be as strong as it is now.”
The beer and wine lists at Maine restaurants in 2069 will feature more beverages made in Maine, experts predicted.
Levi’s wish list for new foods to grow in a warmer Maine includes wine grapes, perhaps the varieties now grown in the cooler wine regions of Europe, places like the Alsace region of France or the Mosel Valley in Germany. But, he added, “I don’t think Maine is going to become Tuscany.”
A more Mediterranean-like climate means that the olive oil you dip your focaccia in might be made from Maine olives, another crop on Levi’s wish list.
Climate change may mean more local grain in Maine’s fields, in turn craft brewers making a greater variety of truly local beer. To see the future, look no farther than the Upper Midwest — Minnesota, North Dakota and far eastern Montana — where the barley line is moving northward at roughly five miles per year, according to Chris Swersey, supply chain specialist at the Brewers Association in Boulder, Colorado. “I would say it’s highly likely that barley will move its way north into Maine” in greater volume, he said.
The news is more alarming when it comes to the seafood. Scientists say the Gulf of Maine is heating up faster than 99 percent of the global oceans. Climate change already has been blamed, in part, for the disappearance of Maine’s mussels and shrimp. Species like cod, which are sensitive to temperature change, are moving to colder waters.
Fishermen and scientists have reported mid-Atlantic species moving northward. Some of those fish could make for good eating, but they also include invasive species such as green crabs. Black sea bass, a firm whitefish common in the waters off New Jersey, are already being pulled up in Maine lobster traps, said Mills, the scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, adding, “I’ve caught them off of Rhode Island, and they’re great to eat.”
Longfin squid have been spotted in waters off the Maine coast, too, Mills said, but not near the shore, so fishermen have not targeted them. During a heat wave in 2012, however, squid moved in closer and stayed there for most of the summer. A small fishery sprang up to take advantage.
Maine may follow in the footsteps of Point Judith in Rhode Island — once a groundfish port, but now primarily a place to catch squid. “It’s sort of the squid capital of the East Coast,” Mills said, “and there’s obviously a large calamari market.”
Experts say that how well we adapt to the impact climate change has on our food systems will depend largely on us as consumers — how flexible we are, and how willing to make changes in our diets. Mainers, Mills said, may have to develop a taste for oily fish like bluefish and mackerel, and Maine chefs will have to learn to prepare it well.
So that’s 50 years. What will the next 100 years bring? A sterile ocean? Collapsed food chains? Drought and starvation? How our great-grandchildren eat a century from now will depend on how seriously we take climate change today.

Full text: For eight years, state government did little to deal with the impacts of a warming Gulf of Maine. That's starting to change.
AUGUSTA — After years of inaction, Maine’s government is finally tackling the rapid warming of the Gulf of Maine.
The Gulf of Maine is the second fastest-warming part of the entire world ocean, a side effect of climate change and the Arctic meltdown, with dramatic implications for life on the Maine coast. As the crisis has unfolded, Maine’s government has avoided taking action that would help the state understand and prepare for the impacts, including ocean acidification, a potentially catastrophic threat to Maine’s marine harvesters.
That has changed suddenly with the end of the eight-year administration of Gov. Paul LePage, who dismissed the scientific evidence that human activity is driving climate change, and the Democratic takeover of the Blaine House and both chambers of the state Legislature this past January.
Gov. Janet Mills has made addressing climate change a pillar of her administration, and in June she secured passage of aggressive legislation to reduce Maine’s greenhouse gas emissions, jumpstart renewable energy, and assess and address sea level rise, ocean acidification, and other impacts.
“We strongly support what the governor is doing,” says Ivy Frignoca of the Friends of Casco Bay, who has been helping lead an ad hoc group of scientists, environmentalists and others who worked to respond to the ocean acidification challenge when state officials would not. “There’s a strong recommendation in the bill to look at how climate change is impacting the oceans and how important it is to focus on remediation and adaptation.”
The climate bill, which Mills signed into law June 26, requires Maine to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and by at least 80 percent by 2050. It created a 35-member Maine Climate Council tasked with developing specific plans to meet these goals, as well as monitoring the effects of ocean acidification, warming ocean temperatures, and changes in the salt and dissolved oxygen content of the gulf, an expected side effect of warming. It holds its inaugural meeting later this month.
Ocean acidification is one of the more serious challenges facing the gulf, a problem tied to the increased carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere, which are more than 70 percent higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution. The levels would be worse but for the fact that the oceans absorb some of that additional CO2, but that has caused them to become 30 percent more acidic over this period, a condition that interferes with the chemical processes by which clams, oysters and other organisms grow their shells.
Acidification has been implicated in failures at Maine oyster hatcheries and mussel farms, and has been shown to weaken clams and other shell-building animals vital to the state’s fishing and aquaculture industries. Nearly 90 percent of the value of Maine’s commercial fish catch comes from such creatures.
Four years ago, Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, told legislators the future of his industry was at stake. Now he’s relieved Maine government is finally taking action.
“Mills deserves a great deal of credit for taking what can be a controversial subject and taking a practical approach to it, trying not to have it become a hyperbolic political football,” Belle says.
Under LePage, scientists and conservationists concerned about the issue made the strategic decision to deal with it separately, so that it wouldn’t get sucked into the political – and highly partisan – war over climate change.
“‘Climate change’ was a dirty term politically in Maine, and people didn’t think it was real or didn’t want to react to it,” says Aaron Strong, a marine and climate policy researcher who helped lead the volunteer group of scientists and environmentalists who tried to respond to the threat, the Maine Ocean and Coastal Acidification Partnership. “Now the calculus is different,” he says, and backs the Mills administration’s decision to fold ocean acidification into the Climate Council’s work.
The administration will officially launch the council – whose members include the commissioners of most government departments – Sept. 26 in Augusta. The council and its subcommittees will start meeting in October and will begin drawing up its final plan next summer, ahead of the statutory deadline of Dec. 1, 2020, said Hannah Pingree, who co-chairs the council and directs the governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future.
“Maine is behind a lot of other states, but we are trying to catch up,” Pingree says.
Julie Rabinowitz, LePage’s former spokeswoman and the head of his political organization, Maine People Before Politics, did not respond to a request for comment from the former governor.
Under President Trump, the federal government has shied away from substantive action on climate issues. Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate change accord – the primary mechanism by which the world’s nations have tried to respond – and he has repeatedly attempted to eliminate funding for many of the key programs that support Gulf of Maine climate initiatives, including Maine Sea Grant, the National Estuarine Research Reserves Program and the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Estuaries Program.
The U.S. House of Representatives, which the Democrats control, passed a bill on June 5 pushed by 1st District Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, that directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the likely impacts of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge.
More than three months later, the Senate version of the bill remains in limbo, despite being introduced by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and co-sponsored by Maine’s Susan Collins, also a Republican, and independent Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats.

Full text: Portland police say Tim Toun, 30, was taken into custody and is being investigated in connection with more than a dozen recent burglaries at Portland businesses.
Police: Tim Toun investigated in connection with string of Portland break-ins

Portland police arrested a city man following an attempted break-in early Wednesday and say he may be charged with other recent burglaries of businesses in and around the downtown.
Tim Toun, a 30-year-old Valley Street resident, was arrested before dawn by officers responding to an attempted break-in at the Maine Historical Society on Congress Street. The organization has a gift shop adjacent to its museum and library.
Toun is charged with criminal mischief and criminal attempt, along with a warrant for previous theft cases, Lt. Robert Martin said. Police have not yet filed charges in connection with a string of more than a dozen commercial burglaries on the Portland peninsula since July 28, but investigators have developed probable cause and anticipate charging Toun in connection with some of the cases, Martin said.
“We have a person in custody for a warrant and we’re working on charges in connection with the burglaries,” Martin said, in response to questions about Toun.
Police responded to the historical society at 489 Congress St. about 2:46 a.m., after a citizen reported hearing glass breaking. Police found that a glass door’s outer window pane was broken, but the inner pane was intact and no one was able to enter the building, Martin said.
Police found Toun in the area of Preble Street with another person, who was not charged. Toun was being held on $1,500 cash bail, and could make his first court appearance Thursday or Friday.
Police have stepped up patrols as they investigate the burglary of 15 businesses — including the historical society — since July 28. Investigators say the burglaries have been reported in the same geographical area of the city. Some of the break-ins targeted businesses with unlocked doors, while others took place at businesses with locked doors and security systems.
The historical society is adjacent to the Wadsworth-Longfellow House and is in the heart of Portland’s downtown a few blocks from City Hall.
Though the burglaries have been concentrated around Portland’s downtown, the break-ins didn’t appear to target specific businesses. Based on the location and the products being sold, the burglaries seem to have been committed on a random basis. The businesses range from an optometrist’s office, apparel designer and a shop specializing in juice smoothies to a hair salon, Thai restaurant and craft beer gastropub.
“At this time, we’re developing the cases for the burglaries,” Martin said.
Burglaries also have been reported at Eyes on Rosemont on Middle Street; Maine Oyster Company on Portland Street; Maine Juice Company on Spring Street; Wallace James Clothing on High Street; Boda on Congress Street; Little Tap House on High Street; Leavitt & Sons Deli on Kennebec Street; Toni’s Touch on Forest Avenue; LB Kitchen on Congress Street; Lio Restaurant on Spring Street; Squeaky Clean Laundromat on Washington Avenue; Others! cafe at Monument Square; Bayside American Cafe on Portland Street; and Still a Good Cause thrift shop on Forest Avenue.
The burglar or burglars typically went after cash registers and safes inside the businesses, sometimes taking the entire register or small safes if they could not be opened. Portland police had advised business owners to lock up, install security systems and leave cash registers empty and open, and safes secured so that a burglar would leave them alone and not try to carry them off.
Toun’s recent criminal history includes convictions for theft, unlawful possession of drugs, and violating the conditions of his release. He pleaded guilty to all three charges in November 2018, which stemmed from an incident in which police searched a car that belonged to a woman on bail conditions. Toun was also in the car, and because police found a crack pipe and other paraphernalia in the car, officers had probable cause to search Toun, according to a police report filed in Cumberland County Unified Court.
During that search, they found a stolen iPhone Toun had taken moments earlier from a house where police were originally called on Rochester Street, along with a Suboxone sublingual strip, a drug used to prevent the symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
Police returned the iPhone to the woman who owned it, and Toun was arrested. He pleaded guilty at his first appearance in court and was sentenced to three days in jail.

Full text: Two more burglaries were reported Tuesday, prompting police to step up patrols of local businesses.
Portland police are investigating two more break-ins they say are similar to a dozen burglaries that have occurred at local businesses since July 28.
Break-ins were reported Tuesday morning at Bayside American Cafe on Portland Street and at the Still a Good Cause thrift shop on Forest Avenue, Lt. Robert Martin said. That brings to 14 the total number of businesses that have reported burglaries in the past three weeks.
Investigators say the burglaries have been reported in the same geographical area of the city, but some targeted businesses with unlocked doors, while others were at businesses with locked doors and security systems. Police have increased patrols of businesses, but continue to find some businesses with unsecured doors or windows.
There doesn’t seem to be any pattern to the commercial businesses that were burglarized. Based on the location and the products being sold, the burglaries seem to have been committed on a random basis. The businesses range in use from an optometrist’s office, apparel designer and a shop specializing in juice smoothies to a hair salon, Thai restaurant and craft beer gastropub.

Police responded to an alarm call at Bayside American Cafe, formerly Bintliffs, at 3:18 a.m. Tuesday, Martin said. Officers found an open door and open window at the cafe. Martin said it’s possible someone reached through the window to unlock the door. The restaurant’s safe was damaged, but no cash was taken, Martin said.
Martin said police also are investigating a reported burglary at the Still a Good Cause thrift shop on Forest Avenue after a door was found pried open. Employees did not believe entry had been made into the building and no other details were available Tuesday afternoon, he said.
Joe Catoggio, who has owned Bayside American Cafe with his wife, Diane, since 2003, said his alarm company notified him at 3 a.m. that something set off a motion sensor inside the building. A security guard who responded to the alarm found the front door ajar and called police, he said. No one was in the restaurant when police arrived.
“They had come in and rifled around looking for cash,” Catoggio said. “They tried to chisel their way into our antique safe. That hurts the most.”
Catoggio said the safe is from 1847 and now has gouges on it, as does the oil painting that was hanging on the front of the safe.
“It was my favorite piece in here,” he said of the painting.
Catoggio said his restaurant was been broken into before by people looking for liquor, but he hasn’t experienced anything like Tuesday’s burglary.
“These folks seem to be a little more sophisticated. The police called them clever,” he said. “It’s not your typical smash and grab.”
Cara Stadler’s Spring Street restaurant Lio was broken into Aug. 17 and the safe was stolen, she said. She said the burglary was similar to ones at nearby restaurants, including LB Kitchen on Congress Street.
“Like Lee (Farrington) at LB Kitchen said, we’re trying to make ends meet and they’re stealing from us,” she said, adding she is insured and had to pay for new locks at the restaurant.
Burglaries also have been reported at Eyes on Rosemont on Middle Street; Maine Oyster Company on Portland Street; Maine Juice Company on Spring Street; Wallace James Clothing on High Street; Boda on Congress Street; Little Tap House on High Street; Leavitt & Sons Deli on Kennebec Street; Toni’s Touch on Forest Avenue; LB Kitchen on Congress Street; Lio Restaurant on Spring Street; Squeaky Clean Laundromat on Washington Avenue; and Others! Cafe at Monument Square.
Martin said officers are continuing to do proactive patrols to check businesses to make sure they are secure, but officers continue to find businesses with open windows or unlocked doors. In some cases, business owners or employees have declined to respond when notified of alarm activation, only to later find the business had been broken into.
“Last night, they were out and found several businesses that were not secured. One of them was a business we’ve previously found not secured,” he said.
Martin said businesses should make sure doors and windows are locked and security systems are activated. He also suggested cash registers be left empty and open and that safes are secured to something if they are small enough to be picked up.
“The suspects have been going into businesses that are alarmed and not alarmed,” he said. “They’re taking the whole register when they go in. They’re making quick work by taking a safe if it’s a manageable weight.”
Portland police said they are actively pursuing investigative leads but have not made any arrests. Anyone with information they believe could help police solve the crimes can call 874-8575 or the anonymous tip line at 874-8584.
Martin also encourages business owners to contact police to make sure the department has updated contact information in case a business is found unsecured or a burglary is reported.

Full text: Some question whether the state is equipped to effectively test for toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning in clams, mussels and oysters
Some question if state equipped to effectively test for toxins that can cause shellfish poisoning in clams, mussels, oysters

Maine shellfish harvesters hope to make up for a longer-than-usual closure of harvest sites caused by the biological toxin known as red tide.
Maine’s Department of Marine Resources routinely posts closures every year that affect clam, mussel and oyster flats up and down the state’s coastline. This year’s closure stretched for three months in parts of southern Maine, nearly three times as long as the normal four to five weeks, and only recently was lifted.
“We don’t have any specific indication of what caused the longer red tide season in southern Maine other than noting a large bloom offshore Down East earlier this summer which correlated with the longer season,” said Jeff Nichols, DMR spokesman.
Although red tide, which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, is not harmful to shellfish, the toxin can be harmful and even fatal to humans, hence the need for closures. PSP symptoms include numbness and tingling of the face, arms and legs, followed by headache, dizziness, nausea and muscular incoordination. Severe poisoning can cause muscle paralysis and respiratory failure.
A marine scientist who used to run the monitoring program for the state said she’s not convinced that levels of toxin, which is produced by the phytoplankton Alexandrium, are any higher.
Darcie Couture, who left the department in 2012 and now runs her own testing lab in Brunswick, said the state conducts far less testing for red tide than it used to and instead orders closures on a precautionary basis.
“It is easy to protect public health — if everything is closed to harvest, then there is no risk to public health,” Couture said. “However, as far as balancing that goal with responsiveness to industry needs, this year seems to have been an epic management failure.”
Nichols did acknowledge that since 2012, the state has relied more on precautionary closures, which require fewer testing sites. In 2012, DMR sampled 328 stations. So far this year, there have been 158, or less than half. Tests are done weekly from March through October.
The state’s new approach means that shellfish zones are closed at the first sign of toxins rather than when toxins exceed a certain level. It’s complicated, though, because toxin levels can spike from week to week.
“Precautionary closures may be made if there are elevated shellfish toxin scores that have not reached the regulatory limit based on a lot of risk factors: phytoplankton trends, current phytoplankton concentrations, weather forecast, sampling frequency and scores at nearby shellfish stations,” Nichols said.
Couture, though, criticized DMR as “ill-equipped to handle fine-tuning closures based on actual shellfish data, because the sampling program is structured differently now than it was prior to 2012.”
“It still seems very hard to explain away the fact that the DMR had longer closures in place this season than during either of the ‘disaster declaration’ years (2005 and 2008),” she added.
Those who make their living on shellfish understand the need to be cautious but they say the impact on the industry is real.
Nicole Twohig is the development coordinator for Quahog Bay Conservancy in Harpswell, which is a nonprofit focused on protecting the ecosystem but also harvests under the brand name Snow Island Oysters.
“We were shut down for about two months, which means we weren’t able to sell,” she said last week. “So that’s a loss of income for us, but the oysters are still there growing. When the closure is lifted, the oysters are bigger than we normally sell so the market is smaller.”
The ideal size, she said, is between 2.5 inches and 3.5 inches.
Twohig said she doesn’t fault the state. It’s doing the best it can. But she, too, wonders whether there are enough resources to manage a burgeoning industry.
“DMR does a really fantastic job regulating the industry for how understaffed they are,” she said. “But people were definitely starting to be concerned once we got to two months,” Twohig said. “You plan for some closures, but if this was my sole income, I would definitely be panicked.”
Nichols said he doesn’t view it as a resource problem. He said biotoxin monitoring and management is conducted by nine DMR staff members, five contract employees and 30 or so volunteers. He said funding is actually more stable now. Contract positions used to be funded with federal disaster relief dollars, which ran out. Now they are part of the General Fund.
Dan Devereaux of Mere Point Oyster Co. in Brunswick also didn’t fault the state and said the task of monitoring for toxins is “a tall order.” But he said he’s noticed a shift in how the closures have happened. He said in years past, red tide used to be more surgically monitored, which had less of an impact on commerce.
“Closing a big area is the safest thing to do, but how do you balance the impact on harvesters?” he said.
The clamming industry has been affected less because their location makes them less susceptible to the biotoxin. A representative from the Maine Clammers Association did not return messages left by a reporter.
Larger shellfish harvesters, known as leaseholders, can ask permission from the state to conduct their own weekly testing, at their expense. Many do, and if they come back clean, the leaseholders can harvest.
But smaller harvesters, known as limited purpose aquaculture sites, or LPAs, don’t have that option.
There are about 125 leaseholders and nearly 600 LPAs operating in Maine.
“The state takes a conservative approach to this, rightfully so, but it does hinder a lot of small farms, which can’t test their products,” Devereaux said.
Red tide is an annual occurrence in Maine, but there are other toxins that requiring monitoring as well.
Last year, the state was forced to close large sections of the Down East coast because of a toxic algae bloom called pseudo-nitzschia, a single-cell organism that can bloom unexpectedly and make domoic acid, a dangerous biotoxin that may cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, or ASP.
That bloom also led to a rare recall of clams and mussels in two consecutive years.
In addition to biotoxin monitoring, the state also regularly tests for bacteria, which also results in periodic closures of shellfish harvesting areas.
The Department of Marine Resources lists all closures on its website in the form of complex legal notices. More information is available at https://www.maine.gov/dmr/shellfish-sanitation-management/closures/psp.html.

Full text: Genetics can provide a fascinating glimpse into our eating habits.

If you’ve ever wanted to blame the sweet tooth you inherited from your great-great-grandma for that second scoop of ice cream you just ate (and thus your big, child-bearing hips), well, now you can. Kind of. You can, at least, forgive yourself for a moment of weakness.
The science of genetics is opening a window — just a crack — onto our food preferences, including that sweet tooth, and the view is fascinating. I discovered this firsthand recently, when I got updated results from an ancestry.com DNA test I took a few years ago. The test uncovered the genetic roots of my sensitivities to sweet, bitter and savory tastes, and I learned more about my love of cilantro and the reason I hold my breath in the bathroom after eating asparagus.
Other companies also do this kind of testing, but I’ve been a member of ancestry.com for eight years. It’s where I keep my still-growing family tree, begun the old-fashioned way by my father in small-town records and remote, overgrown graveyards, and continued by me using online resources. Genealogy is addictive. As Barry Starr, director of scientific communication at ancestry.com, humorously put it in a recent interview, each new discovery — another relative identified on a 19th-century census record or a cause of death uncovered on a 1930s-era death certificate — gives you a little hit of dopamine. So when the DNA tests finally fell into a price range I could afford, my curiosity won out and I ordered one. I spit into a little tube and sent my genes off to the lab.
Initially the test just tracked my ethnicity. If it proved anything beyond a shadow of a doubt, it’s that I’m one of the whitest people on the planet, despite my longing for a more diverse background. A whopping 57% of my genes can be traced back to England, Wales and northwestern Europe. Another 29% hails from Ireland and Scotland. I have an 11% serving of Germanic Europe and just a dollop of Norway in my chromosomes. Initially my test also showed traces of North African and Persian DNA. But here’s the great thing about the test: As the pool of people submitting their spit to ancestry.com grows, and the organization’s scientists learn more from their DNA, they can narrow down your own family origins and give you updates. The updates are free; they’re just another little dopamine hit when you turn on your computer and discover new information in your account. In my case — much to my disappointment — the traces of North African and Persian DNA fell away.
Then, not long ago, I signed onto my account and discovered a new section on genetic traits, ranging from genes that affect my appearance to those that affect how my body processes vitamins. Most interesting to me were the sensory traits, many of which deal with food preferences. By testing two olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11, for example, the test confirmed that I love cilantro — I’m not one of those people who think the herb tastes like dish soap.
But I am one of those people who have always noticed a certain, um, odor in the bathroom after eating asparagus. When we digest asparagus, our body produces asparagusic acid, which breaks down into funky-smelling compounds in our urine. The ability to smell these compounds is a dominant trait, so I inherited it from one of my parents (gee, thanks, Mom and Dad). People who cannot detect these metabolites are said to have “asparagus anosmia.”

NATURE VS. NURTURE Genetics aren’t the only thing that determine whether you prefer sweet over savory, love or hate cilantro, or can smell your stinky urine, however.
“Basically what we say is genetics loads the gun but environment fires it, pulls the trigger,” says Danielle Reed, a taste geneticist who is also associate director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, a nonprofit dedicated to basic research on taste and smell. “You have a certain landscape of what you can and cannot taste that is determined genetically, then you have a whole life experience that fills in the gaps that drive you toward what you like and don’t like to eat.”
My genetics say, for example, that I am extra-sensitive to the taste of bitter foods, which should mean that every time I take a bite of Brussels sprouts or broccoli, which contain bitter natural compounds called glucosinolates, my face should scrunch up in a look that says “This is revolting.” But I love broccoli, bitter greens and cauliflower. I confess I hated Brussels sprouts when I was a kid, but I think that had more to do with the way my mother prepared them than their natural flavor.
So what’s up? The ancestry.com test examines three markers in the TAS2R38 gene, which plays a key role in how we perceive bitter flavors. But Reed and Starr both point out that other genes may be at play as well. Reed says humans have 25 bitter receptors, each tuned to different bitter compounds. Some people are blind to certain bitter tastes, she said, but not all of them. Others may be able to taste the bitterness of, say, Brussels sprouts, but they like it.
That contradiction could be due to the confounding environmental factor, which can include cultural differences. Starr once tested the perception of bitter on a variety of people using strips coated with a synthetic chemical similar to glucosinolates. “Most people responded in horror at the taste of it,” Starr said. “But a friend of mine who grew up in a part of Asia where there were a lot of bitter foods in the diet actually didn’t mind at all. She thought it was fine.”
Sensitivity to bitter tastes is a dominant trait, which means at least one of my parents must be a “taster.” I’m guessing it’s my father, who won’t let a single bite of broccoli get past his lips but loves collard greens because he was raised in the South, where collards are regularly on the dinner table. Eating a food you hate until you like it, or at least tolerate it, is an example of the “mere exposure effect,” Reed explained, “and it means that you come to like things that you’re constantly exposed to.”
Most Americans would be disgusted by natto, fermented soybeans with a “snot-like” texture that are enjoyed in Japan, says scientist Bob Holmes, author of the 2017 book “Flavor: The Science of Our Most Neglected Sense.” And Japanese consumers have, historically, snubbed cheese, which is beloved by many westerners. “That seems to be cultural,” Holmes said, “because cheese is becoming more popular in Asia, and certainly second-generation Asian-Americans are perfectly happy with cheese.”
Holmes is a lot like me. He had his DNA tested through Monell, then followed up with a panel of taste receptor tests and discovered he’s very sensitive to bitter tastes. That means he should be pushing them away. In fact, he loves bitter greens, especially rapini (or broccoli rabe). He chalks up the discrepancy between his genes and taste buds to life experiences.
“Nobody likes the first taste of coffee” because of the bitterness, Holmes said, “but we quickly learn that it comes with all sorts of pleasurable consequences. You get that buzz from it, and you start to associate coffee with being out with friends, so you learn to love the bitter.”
Holmes also cited experiments by the Oxford psychologist Charles Spence that illustrated just how important environment is in flavor perception.
“He had people eat oysters listening to the sounds of the seashore, like crashing waves and calling seagulls, versus when they were listening to cattle mooing,” Holmes said. “They rated that the oysters tasted better, and tasted more of the sea, when they could hear the sounds of the seashore.”

SWEET DEAL You might think that someone whose genes indicate they are sensitive to sweet tastes would have a huge sweet tooth. But it’s actually the opposite. People who are sensitive to sweets “just want a small piece of cake instead of a big piece of cake,” Starr said. “There’s less required to feel like you’ve had enough sweets.”
According to my test results, I’m “a little more sensitive” to sweets. That makes sense to me because I occasionally crave sweets (especially ice cream and chocolate), but once I indulge, I can sometimes go days or weeks without more. And I’m hyper-sensitive to the sugary syrups used at a lot of coffee houses and bars. A little sugar goes a long way.
Humans are wired for sugar, scientists say, perhaps because our ancient ancestors learned that honey or fruit provided a quick source of energy. (Similarly, humans may have evolved to reject bitter tastes because it helped them avoid poisonous foods.)
“We have wonderful videos of infants in utero when their mothers have glucose in their amniotic fluid because their mother is diabetic,” Reed said. “You can see that the infant is drinking the sweetened solution in the amniotic fluid. So babies can taste it in utero.”
But environment affects how we perceive sweet as well. Holmes’ tests, for example, showed that he is less sensitive to sweet flavors, which means it should take more sweets to satisfy him. But the very morning he found out that bit of information about himself, he had to pour out a sweetened iced cappuccino he bought at Starbucks. “I couldn’t drink it because it was too sweet,” he said. “And I have no problems skipping dessert. So behaviorally I don’t have a sweet tooth, even though my genes and my lab tests suggest that I do.”
Holmes suspects his palate leans this way because his family rarely ate dessert when he was a child.
Reed said the “reward factor” also plays a big role in our desire for sweets. “Food is very rewarding for some people,” she said, “and they just cannot let go of the reward value of sugared foods. That’s probably a combination of both their genetic makeup and their experience. Some people have a lifetime of experience eating sugar to comfort themselves.”
Sensitivity to savory flavors, or umami, works the same way. My test showed I’m “a little less sensitive” to umami, which may explain my love of aged cheeses and ripe tomatoes.
Can anything practical be learned from all of this, or is a genetic exploration of our flavor preferences just a bit of fun? It’s too early to say how such knowledge could help people meet nutritional goals or otherwise improve their health, Reed said. But knowing, for example, that your genes say you can’t taste sweet foods especially well could encourage you to treat yourself with more compassion, she says.
“It will help you understand why you’re putting four teaspoons of sugar in your coffee, right?” Reed said. “It’s no longer a moral weakness. It’s just there’s a biology there.”

Company never answers allegations it was part of lobster embezzlement

A federal judge Thursday ordered a company allegedly created to help facilitate a scheme to steal lobsters to pay a civil judgment of more than $4.5 million.
The ruling came in a civil suit filed by Sea Salt, a Saco restaurant and lobster wholesaler, against a former employee and part owner over lobsters allegedly shipped off the books and resold.
The suit, filed last September, said Matthew Bellerose of Scarborough shipped lobsters from Sea Salt without generating shipping labels or invoices so the company didn’t bill and wasn’t paid for the crustaceans. Sea Salt contends Bellerose, who had worked for the business since 2009, shipped nearly $1.5 million worth of lobster that he and a partner then sold.
Bellerose and his partner, Vincent J. Mastropasqua of Portland, set up a company, East End Transport, to handle some of the shipments, Sea Salt’s suit said.
Sea Salt sued Bellerose; Mastropasqua; his brother Anthony Mastropasqua; Amanda Bellerose, Matthew Bellerose’s wife; and East End Transport seeking to recover its losses. Because the suit alleges a criminal conspiracy, Sea Salt was able to seek triple its losses as damages, and U.S. District Judge John A. Woodcock Jr. imposed that penalty after a short hearing Thursday.
Woodcock had earlier entered a default judgment against East End Transport because it didn’t defend itself against the allegations. No one representing the company or the other defendants was at Thursday’s hearing, held to determine damages.
Laura White, Sea Salt’s lawyer, said it isn’t clear whether East End Transport has any assets that can be used to satisfy the judgment.
“That’s what I’m going to find out,” she said after the hearing.
Matthew Bellerose was in charge of Sea Salt’s order fulfillment and shipping operation. In 2017, he was offered a 20% stake in the business.
The suit said Bellerose admitted the embezzlement to his Sea Salt partners and offered to pay back the money after he was fired in June 2018. Bellerose said he did it to pay for his 20% share of the company, the suit says.
“Guys, I just want to say I’m really sorry,” Bellerose texted his partners, according to the suit. “Not only have I betrayed your trust but years of friendship as well and that one will haunt me forever. … I’d like to resolve this as best as I possibly can with you guys without my innocent family having to suffer for my bad decisions.”
Both Matthew and Amanda Bellerose and the Mastropasqua brothers have denied the allegations in court filings. The civil cases against the other defendants are currently scheduled for trial in March.
Another Maine lobster wholesaler lost money in an embezzlement scheme similar to the one Bellerose and the others are accused of. In January 2018, a former Massachusetts man pleaded guilty to shipping 50,000 pounds of lobster, worth about $360,000, to a customer in China.
Jonathan F. Cowles’ employer, Maine Coast Shellfish, was not paid for those lobsters. Cowles also pleaded guilty to federal charges of wire fraud for sending himself $25,000 in commissions to which he wasn’t entitled.
Cowles pleaded guilty and in June 2018 was sentenced to six months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of nearly $360,000. Court records indicated he has since moved to Hawaii, where he will be on supervised release until 2022.

Full text: This summer has had an inexplicable phenomenon of early and late summer colliding, writes Dana Wilde.
A typical Maine summer has four times, according to me. Ante: black flies, bluets, mosquitoes and dandelions. Early: hawkweed, buttercups, day lilies and dragonflies. Mid: Queen Anne’s lace, goldenrod, horseflies and deer flies. Late: turning sumac, spiders and northwest wind.
So let me say a few words since July and August, without fail, inspire a sort of cosmic impulse in me to reflect back the beauty carpeting the woods, fields and backyard. Just naming flowers seems to create little dharanis that transact with the wave-topped goldenrod, symmetries of cinquefoils, unearthly trefoils, St. John’s wort, cow vetch, crown vetch, dust-pink steeplebush and Pure-Lands-blue-rayed chicory. The buttonbush and yellow rocket, stitchwort, chickweed, and the bladder campion that took over a huge swath of driveway-side this year. The black-eyed Susans, oxeyes, honeysuckle and fleabane early, stitchwort, chickweed and milkweed. In July, the orange touch-me-nots, the wild madder, meadowsweet and greeny-yellow parsnip. The hemlock, valerian and Queen Anne’s hovering-moon umbels later, and New England, New York and bushy asters at last.
The color green: This summer from the get-go seemed more burgeonously verdant than usual, with maple branches overhanging the driveway that I thought I trimmed back last fall, and soon August will settle into that rich, black-shadow eye-vibration of impending autumn. It will smell like ripening acorns.
There have been this summer, though, unsettling anomalies. Most troubling was the absence of Canada geese on the backroad pond in Jackson, and a fleeting paucity of purple martins in the park. Where did they go this summer? July, it turned out, was the hottest month ever recorded in Maine, according to how many days I stayed in out of the sun and WCSH meteorologist Keith Carson. The catch the last few summers of record-breaking worldwide warmth has been that nighttime lows are bottoming out significantly higher than in the past, raising the average temperature in 24-hour periods. It was certainly true in my bed. There are also the heat wave in Alaska and the alarming amount of melt on Greenland’s glaciers in the past few weeks, which are technically not related to the beauty of Maine’s midsummer woods, but probably, in reality, are.
And there is this summer’s technically inexplicable phenomenon, for example, of early summer colliding with late summer. The lilacs and wild roses were two or three weeks late to blossom this year. The gaudy orange day lilies that grow like sunfire down the embankment behind the mailbox came late, too. Why? Usually they show glimpses of the coming conflagration by mid-June. This year they let July 1 go before they came out, and some of them are still burning, when, if I remember right, they should be going by or gone.
This is the disturbing part, because along with the late-lasting day lilies is early-turning staghorn sumac. Up and down Route 9, whole stands of them look as orange-red as September. They always go sooner than the rest, but how soon is soon? Meaning, as Bonnie observed last week, that early summer has somehow coalesced with late. Like a months-long sentence that somehow got garbled.
I don’t know. I suppose a reader will set me straight and say this has all happened before. But not on my watch. Which admittedly is always addled this time of year by the incredible inflorescent spell we weather here. Blackberry stars, chokecherry fingers early on. Then tansy, yellow goatsbeard, evening primrose, pineapple weed, purple loosestrife, purple nightshade, blue vervain like mandarava flowers hidden in the grass. White sweet, red and rabbit’s foot clovers, Joe-Pye weed, fireweed and medallions of yarrow. Soon will come the heal-all, eyebright, egg-yellow figwort, pearly everlasting’s little chewable oyster shell globes. And ever and anon the goldenrod like prayers bubbling out of the empyrean, one flower to rule them all.
Who knows what is happening. But I can’t stop pointing to the beauty. Put that in your carpet.

Oyster shell recycling aimed at reducing Casco Bay acidification

Full text: The effort is being prompted by a report linking ocean acidification to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.

Tucked behind some of Portland’s most-beloved restaurants, bright-blue bins filled with oyster shells are swarming with flies. Collecting these shells is not a glamorous job. If one lid is slightly ajar, the sharp smell of drying shells hangs in the humid, summer air.
Despite the odor and flies, twice a week Zach Gordon and Libby Davis load about 20 of these 100-pound bins onto a 10-foot trailer attached to the back of Davis’s truck and haul them away.
“I’m doing it for Mother Nature,” Davis chuckled.
Since June, the team has gone out on Tuesdays and Fridays to collect discarded shells from 10 restaurants as part of Ocean to Plate to Ocean, a project by the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership and Maine Coastal Program’s pilot project to reduce ocean acidification by reintegrating the recycled shells into Casco Bay.
The effort was prompted by a report from the Commission to Study the Effects of Coastal and Ocean Acidification on Commercially Harvested and Grown Species, established by the Maine Legislature in 2014. It recommended spreading shells or other forms of calcium carbonate to remediate the impacts of local acidification, a result of climate change.
In its final report published in 2015, the commission highlighted the connection between ocean acidification and rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The report noted that ocean acidification has increased 30 percent since fossil fuels were first used.
Maine’s effort to recycle oyster shells is not novel; nearly 20 other states have shell recycling programs. However, most states do not recycle shells to reduce ocean acidification, instead they use the shells to restore natural oyster reefs.
The report cites research by Mark Green, professor of natural sciences at St. Joesph’s College, finding that acidification hinders calcification, the process by which lobsters, crabs, mussels, oysters and clams form shells. The goal of shell recycling is to add natural calcium sources to the water to reduce acidity and promote calcification.
The Casco Bay Estuary Partnership received $99,180 in funding for the project through the Climate Ready Estuaries — an EPA program that is linked to the National Estuaries Program. Project partners include the Maine Coastal Program, which is running the shell collection effort; Gateways to Opportunity, which is conducting outreach for youth engagement programs; and Bigelow Labs, which is researching the use of shells to ameliorate the impacts of acidification on shellfish aquaculture.
Gordon, a graduate student participating in University of New England North’s ocean food science program, and Davis, the general manager at Maine Oyster Co., are the program’s two collectors.
Gordon and Theresa Torrent, Coastal Educator and Communications Coordinator at the Maine Coastal Program, reached out to approximately 15 restaurants in Portland. Ten agreed to participate in the pilot program.
Davis, who joined the project after hearing about it through the owner of Maine Oyster Co., has a bachelor’s degree in biology and a truck that tows the 10-foot trailer loaded with shells.
On collection day, Gordon, 26, and Davis, 27, hitch the trailer at 8:30 a.m. From there, the team goes from restaurant to restaurant collecting anywhere from a single, 6-gallon bucket filled with oyster shells to seven 30-gallon bins. In place of the full containers, the two leave clean ones and then drive to Ecomaine in South Portland for the most taxing aspect of the job — dumping the shells.
The team learned that each bin must be dumped by two people after Gordon hurt his back dumping one himself. The shells are dumped into two 30-cubic yard rolloff containers that are covered to prevent seagulls from getting into the shells. The containers will sit at Ecomaine for a year after the last shells are added so the shells can “cure” to ensure all bacteria is dead.
The year-long curing process complies with Department of Environmental Protection rules. It also alleviates concerns about introducing non-native bacteria, as many of the oysters consumed in Maine come from outside the state. The cured shells will then be ready to be dumped in the bay. The team is still developing a method for the restoration.
As with any pilot program, the team has had to troubleshoot obstacles, such as Gordon’s back injury and driving a 10-foot trailer through the Old Port. They have also gotten help through community partners. The restaurants’ efforts to thoroughly sort shells and Ecomaine’s help creating a truck ramp has made the job more efficient.
When Eventide, one of the participating restaurants, was initially asked to join the program, the management hesitated because of the volume of oysters served. After hearing that the restaurant would only be responsible for training staff to sort shells from other compost such as lemons, Eventide decided to participate.
Kira Butera, director of operations at Eventide Oyster Co., Honey Paw and Hugo’s, says Eventide shucks between 14,000 and 16,800 oysters a week. Before the recycling project the restaurant composted shells, and Butera said potential environmental payoff from recycling is worth the task of thoroughly sorting shells.
Kit Pashal, general manager at The Shop, a restaurant on Washington Avenue, says that business serves between 12,000 and 15,000 oysters a week during the summer. He says the program is a “win-win” because the free shell pick-ups cut the composting bill by two-thirds.
Torrent, at Maine Coastal Program, expects one of the two containers will be filled next week and the shells will be cured by August 2020. While planning the program, Torrent thought the first container wouldn’t be filled until the fall, and she is impressed with the volume of shells.
“We had no idea we were going to get this much this quickly,” she said.
The team will continue to collect shells until the second container is filled. That will take more time because the tourist season will begin to wind down after the summer.
If the program expands, funding and volunteers will be needed. The team is considering private donations or selling oyster shell merchandise, but do not have any firm plans in place yet.
Regardless of the program’s future, all the community partners say they are excited to participate in a sustainable project.
“We felt this was a great opportunity to give back from the resources we pull from,” said Butera, the Eventide operations manager.

Full text: Sediment removal is needed for the safe passage of Bath-built ships.

BATH — The Department of the Navy in Bath is seeking a 10-year permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to dredge portions of the Kennebec River from Bath to Phippsburg to allow the passage of Bath-built destroyers.
The Navy expects maintenance dredging will be needed every three years, according to a news release.
The first dredging would happen during the winter of 2019-2020 and would move 80,000 cubic yards — roughly the volume of 20 Olympic swimming pools — of sand and sediment from the bottom of the Kennebec River between Bath and Phippsburg, particularly in shoal-prone areas. Shoals are large wave-like formations of sand that accumulate on the bottom of the river.
Up to 50,000 cubic yards will be removed from Doubling Point and dumped in the river near Bluff Head to make the area around Doubling Point 31 feet deep. At the river mouth, up to 20,000 cubic yards will be taken until the river is 29 feet deep and disposed of near Jackknife Ledge. Both disposal sites have been used repeatedly in previous dredging projects.
The dredging process takes approximately a month to complete, using a hopper dredge and/or a mechanical dredge. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not disclose how much the process costs.
These maintenance dredges ensure the Kennebec is deep enough so the military vessels made by Bath Iron Works can move downriver to open ocean. BIW’s most recently christened Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the future USS Daniel Inouye, will leave the Bath shipyard in 2020 for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
Tim Dugan, a spokesperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said that portion of the Kennebec River federal navigation channel is “authorized by Congress to be so wide and so clear. … (BIW) needs to release those ships in a timely fashion. They need those areas of the river free and clear of debris.”
Eleven Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and one Zumwalt-class are under contract for delivery in the next 10 years.
A BIW-built Arleigh Burke class-destroyer has a draft (depth of the hull that sits underwater) of about 30 feet, and a Zumwalt has a draft of 27.6 feet.
BIW spokesman David Hench referred questions about the dredging to the Navy but stated in an email: “Maintaining a navigable channel in the Kennebec River is necessary for safe passage of ships and is essential to our business and our Navy customer’s goal of delivering the quality ships it needs for the nation’s fleet.”
The last dredging of the Kennebec River in April 2017 drew criticism from environmentalists. Federally protected Atlantic salmon, short-nosed sturgeon and Atlantic sturgeon live and spawn in the river, and the dumping of the dredged materials could harm seeding shellfish in Phippsburg, critics argued.
The 2017 dredging was an “emergency” dredging as it was needed to allow the USS Rafael Peralta, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, to depart from Bath, according to previous reports. Shortly before the ship’s departure, it was discovered the ship couldn’t navigate the river, even at high tide, thus an emergency dredging was needed to clear the way.
The Department of the Navy acknowledged the impact dredging the Kennebec River and depositing the material poses on the river’s ecosystem. In a news release, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the Navy is consulting with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
“Both the Navy and Army Corps of Engineers are very concerned about the environmental impacts of the dredging,” said Colleen O’Rourke, a spokesperson for the Department of the Navy in Bath. “As required in the permitting process, we extensively coordinate with both federal and state environmental agencies to ensure that all requirements are met.”
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers outlined turbidity, or the amount of sediment suspended in the water, as one potential problem for species living in the river because it decreases both visibility in the water and the amount of light able to pass through the water.
Dugan said dredging in the winter reduces the impact on the river’s ecosystem because endangered species aren’t spawning then.
“The impacts will be minimal and of short duration,” he said.
David Grey, chairman of the Phippsburg Shellfish Commission, said, “We’re totally fine with them dredging; we support BIW, as long as they don’t do it in the summer when the shellfish are seeding.”
Grey said when the river is dredged during the spring and summer, “the shellfish are more or less suffocated” when the dredged material is deposited in shellfish harvest areas in Phippsburg.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a public request for comment, as required by the Clean Water Act of 1977. They encourage comments from members of the public. Comments should be submitted in writing to Nick Livesay, Director, Bureau of Land Resources, Department of Environmental Protection, 17 State House Station, Augusta, ME, 04333-0017 or tomick.livesay@maine.gov.

Full text: Still no known timeline for decision on 40-acre lease in Brunswick bay
BRUNSWICK — The Department of Marine Resources has rejected a petition to change the criteria for aquaculture lease applications on the basis that the request was “not realistic,” was “arbitrary” and could have a “perverse outcome” for some applicants.
Meanwhile, the company pitching a 40-acre oyster aquaculture lease on Maquoit Bay continues to await the department’s decision on its application, which is now two months overdue.
A group known as Save Maquoit Bay, composed of coastal property owners, lobstermen and fishermen, submitted a 189-signature petition asking officials to include a stipulation requiring the department to consider whether any other locations near a proposed lease site could “accommodate the proposed activities while interfering less with existing and surrounding uses of an area.”
While the petition requested that the actions be imposed statewide, locally, Mere Point Oyster Co.’s proposed 10-year, 40-acre lease has been mired in controversy. A marathon three-day hearing that spanned several months wrapped up in mid-January after waterfront property owners and lobster fishermen spoke out against what they saw as conflicting uses of the bay and the potential infringement on valuable lobstering grounds. Some lobstermen who spoke out against the lease are also members of Save Maquoit Bay.
The department had 120 days to make a ruling, which would have ended May 15; but according to Jeff Nichols, communications director of the Department of Marine Resources, “depending on the complexity of the application and the evidence, it may take longer.”
Now, 60 days past that deadline, all parties still are awaiting a response.
Save Maquoit Bay’s petition further delayed the decision, after a hearing May 22 and a public comment period that extended to June 1.
The group asked for an immediate moratorium on all pending lease applications greater than 10 acres and requested the proposed rule be applied retroactively so it still would apply to the application in Maquoit Bay.
In their decision, department officials said that aside from questions of legality over the proposed changes, “it is not realistic to expect the department to evaluate all other potential lease sites in an undefined ‘vicinity.’” The resources required to conduct diving and scoping sessions for every alternative and to assess every location against the criteria would be immense, the report stated, and alternative lease sites could affect people who previously thought they would not be affected, creating more notice and scoping issues.
“Further, such an exercise could result in the perverse outcome of the selection of a site that does not unreasonably interfere with any existing uses but is unsuitable for the proposed aquaculture activity,” officials said.
The request to impose a moratorium on lease applications greater than 10 acres also was denied because “a 10-acre limitation on lease size may have the unintended effect of causing applicants to apply for multiple leases, as opposed to one single lease of a size that is suitable to meet their needs,” they continued, calling the moratorium “arbitrary.”
Save Maquoit Bay members see it as anything but that, and said in a news release that with the decision, the Maine Department of Marine Resources effectively “turned its back on a growing issue in Maine’s water.”
“The in-water aquaculture leases are huge in Maine,” said Tom Santaguida, a lobsterman. “One person can have 10 100-acre leases or, in other words, own 1,000 acres of the bottom. That is going to impact all of us who are trying to make a living,” he said.
Crystal Canney, spokeswoman for Save Maquoit Bay, is concerned that large leases such as Mere Point’s could harm Maine’s working waterfront beyond just infringing on lobstering grounds.
“With Maine’s large lease size, leases become attractive to out-of-state investors, hoping to own a piece of Maine,” she said in the release. “Aquaculture (with 42 pending leases and a 97% approval rate by the DMR) is no longer about small business in Maine. Our coalition aims to protect Maine’s Ocean from being owned by a handful of individuals at the expense of many.”
She said when the Legislature comes back in January, Save Maquoit Bay will try to have lawmakers address the transferability of leases so that the land cannot be handed over to out-of-state or international corporations without at least a public hearing.
Save Maquoit Bay, which has hundreds of supporters on its Facebook page, will “continue its fight to protect lobstermen and the privatization of Maine’s Oceans,” Canney said.
Dan Devereaux, co-owner of Mere Point Oyster Co. said he and business partner, Doug Niven, are glad the lease criteria were not changed. If adopted, the rules would have implications that reverberated up and down the coast, he said, implications he thinks would damage the burgeoning aquaculture industry and what remains of Maine’s working waterfront.
Canney said the citizen’s petition was a larger-reaching effort to help lobstermen from Lubec to Kittery who are up against a lot, facing regulations and problems involving right whales, bait and now inshore aquaculture. She declined to comment on the department’s delay in the Mere Point Oyster decision.
In the meantime, while Niven and Devereaux await a decision on their lease, operations are being affected by the two-month delay.
“We hoped to have moved the oysters over to the new lease site at this point,” Devereaux said. “We can’t stop them from growing” and they need more space, the bigger they get. They applied for more Limited Purpose Aquaculture sites, or LPAs, in the meantime to accommodate the bigger bivalves. The proposed lease site would allow the company’s annual oyster harvest to increase from about 60,000 in 2018 to about 1.5 million in the next three years, putting as many as 5 million oysters in the water at a given time.
The department has been quiet on when a decision might be forthcoming, but Devereaux said he is patient, knowing that the aquaculture division has been somewhat overwhelmed by the rapid growth in the industry, with more and more Mainers putting in applications for sites as the state moves more toward more “sustainable aquaculture.”
“We’re bursting at the seams,” he said, adding that he hopes the decision comes soon so they can move forward with more space.
No matter wha,t though, “us closing up shop and going away like some are determined to see, … that’s not going to happen,” Devereaux said.
If the application is ultimately denied, they will apply again, he said.
“We like what we do and we believe in it, so we’re going to try to stick around.”

Full text: Maine Democrat Chellie Pingree's measure moves to the U.S. Senate, while state lawmakers appear likely to pass Gov. Janet Mills' climate package.

After years of inaction, the U.S. House passed a bill Wednesday directing federal authorities to assess the risks that ocean acidification — a byproduct of global warming — presents to coastal communities, fishermen and the aquaculture industry.
Scientists have shown the oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb greater quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In the Gulf of Maine, researchers have documented that acidic conditions stunt clam growth and make it so difficult for baby oysters to build their first shells that they often die before they can complete them. The effects on lobster, Maine’s most valuable fishery, remain unclear.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democrat representing Maine’s 1st District, first introduced the Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act nearly four years ago, but it failed to receive so much as a hearing, despite having bipartisan support. It passed Wednesday morning by a unanimous voice vote, with six Republican co-sponsors and no concerted opposition in the House, where Democrats have been in the majority since late last year.
“I’m so proud to see the House’s unequivocal, unanimous support for my ocean acidification bill today,” Pingree said in a statement immediately after the vote. “It goes to show that it’s not controversial to study the changes happening to our oceans — in order to take action, we have to understand what we’re dealing with.”
U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat representing Maine’s 2nd District, was a co-sponsor of the bill, as was his Republican predecessor, Bruce Poliquin.
The bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work with state and local experts to assess the likely effects of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge. NOAA would prepare a public report on which communities are most exposed to the problem, and support state efforts to assess their own vulnerabilities.
In early March, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, reintroduced a companion bill in the U.S. Senate, which is co-sponsored by six senators, including both of Maine’s: Republican Susan Collins and independent Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats. Its prospects are unclear, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has been focused on confirming as many federal judges as possible at the expense of moving legislation. This prompted Louisiana Republican John Kennedy to complain May 22: “We have done nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada.”
Murkowski’s spokeswoman, Karina Borger, said Murkowski would look for opportunities to advance the bill. “It’s definitely a priority of hers, and she will advocate for it and push for it,” Borger said.
Meanwhile, the Maine Legislature is expected to vote next week on Gov. Janet Mills’ climate change bill, L.D. 1679, which would establish a state Climate Change Council to oversee Maine’s efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for climate-change-driven disruptions, including ocean acidification and other changes within the Gulf of Maine.
“Compared with what has been going on nationally, we have been very encouraged to see fairly broad bipartisan support for creating a climate plan and figuring out how to make it happen,” said Hannah Pingree, who has overseen the drafting of the bill as head of the governor’s Office of Policy and Management.
The Maine bill is likely to pass, as Democrats control both houses of the Legislature, it received unanimous, bipartisan committee approval and is one of the governor’s priorities.
Carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere are more than 70 percent higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution, and they now stand at the highest level in at least 800,000 years.
The levels would be worse but for the fact that the oceans absorb some of that additional carbon dioxide, but that has caused them to become 30 percent more acidic over the past century and a half, creating conditions that interfere with the chemical processes by which clams, oysters and other organisms grow their shells.

Full text: While the tornadoes get bigger and the wildfires burn, the politicians fiddle for money, writes Dana Wilde.
In Oklahoma this week, schools were closed because huge tornadoes were expected. An F-5 tornado had killed seven kids at a school in 2013, and officials decided the risk of a big twister this time was too great. On TV news, a mother said she was grateful for the decision.
“It never used to be like this,” she said.
Unusually severe tornadoes and storms have become more and more usual in recent years. The cause of the increases is climate change. The change is driven primarily by rising air and water temperatures.
The temperatures are rising because carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been rising for about 200 years as a result of human activities, mainly the waste from burning oil and coal. Animals are going extinct, oceans are rising, glaciers are melting, wildfires are destroying forestland, and unusually strong tornadoes are killing kids.
So what are we doing about it?
When the eight Arctic Council countries met earlier this month, they were unable to agree on a text mentioning “climate change” because one of the countries would not sign off on it. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, specifically. In his own public remarks, Pompeo instead pointed out that receding ice sheets would provide incredible opportunities for plundering the Arctic’s “undiscovered oil,” gas, uranium, gold, diamonds, “fisheries galore.”
While the tornadoes get bigger and the wildfires burn, the politicians fiddle for money.

BURNING • January through April this year was the third-hottest globally on record for that time period, NOAA reported this week.
• A recent study found that between 1980 and 1990, Greenland’s glaciers were melting at rate that sent about 51 billion tons of ice into the ocean. Between 2010 and 2018, 286 billion tons went into the ocean,
meaning that of the nearly 14 millimeters of sea-level rise in total caused in Greenland since 1972, half of it has occurred since 2010. The researchers predict the ice losses will get worse.
• Another study found that increasing ocean temperatures have reduced the sustainable catch of 124 fish and shellfish species since 1938.
• Climate models developed for the United Nations’ 2021 assessment of global warming are starting to predict temperature rises so high (up to 5 degrees Celsius) that the scientists think the models must be faulty. Many previous models of global temperatures have underestimated the rises that actually occurred.
• A study published this month reports that rainfall increases in the Midwest between 1989 and 2016 were directly responsible for reductions in corn crops of as much as 37%. Heavy precipitation events have increased by up to 42% in parts of the Midwest since 1958 and are expected to become more frequent and more intense as a result of climate change.
• A report by scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency indicates that if climate change continues unchecked, effects such as rising sea levels and lake and stream temperatures, longer pollen seasons, increases in harmful algal blooms, wildfires, flooding and disease-carrying insects, among other things, will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Some of the economic damage can be averted by taking immediate action, the report suggests. The human suffering, apparently, is a different matter.

FIDDLING • President Donald Trump’s budget plan for 2020 would cut 13% of National Institutes of Health funding, 12% of National Science Foundation funding and 16.5% of the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, hitting renewable energy and environmental research programs especially hard. The EPA and Interior, Agriculture and even Defense departments would see huge cuts to funding for science programs.
• Trump’s National Security Council has discussed forming an advisory committee whose mission will be to challenge the scientific consensus on climate change.
• In April, Trump signed executive orders that limit states’ abilities to regulate oil and gas projects.
• In April, the Senate confirmed David Bernhardt as secretary of the interior. Bernhardt is a former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry.
• In May, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement revised the Well Control Rule developed after the Deepwater Horizon disaster that poured about 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The revised rule relieves oil companies of many federal safety requirements and suggests they instead follow oil industry “recommended practices.”
• The Office of the Inspector General has opened an investigation into multiple conflict-of-interest complaints against Bernhardt.
• This month the U.S. House passed the Climate Action Now Act. It would prohibit federal funds from being used to leave the Paris Climate Accord, require the U.S. to comply with climate commitments, and require Trump to report within four months on plans to meet obligations. No Republicans supported it. It is unlikely to pass in the Senate because Republicans are the majority there.
• In April, the EPA published “Planning for Natural Disaster Debris,” offering advice for local planners on coping with the aftermath of floods, hurricanes and wildfires expected to increase in “frequency and intensity” as a result of climate change.
• In contrast, EPA Director Andrew Wheeler told a television interviewer that “most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out.” What, me worry?

FIGHTING CHANCES • German Chancellor Angela Merkel established a “climate cabinet” to plan for Germany to attain carbon-emissions neutrality by 2050.
• The British government has committed to phasing out coal-fired power by 2025.
• In March, a federal judge in Alaska declared a Trump order revoking a ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans illegal.
• A federal judge in Colorado who was appointed by Ronald Reagan ruled the approval by the Interior Department of two gas drilling plans was illegal, in part because the officials did not adequately consider environmental impacts in the plans.
• In February, the Senate passed, 98-2, a conservation bill that will protect millions of acres of land and rivers and establish four new national monuments.
• In April, Maine Gov. Janet Mills signed the nation’s first statewide ban on the use of Styrofoam food containers. The law takes effect Jan. 1, 2021.
How many schools have to get flattened by huge tornadoes, and towns and whole countries need to get swamped by hurricanes like Michael, Florence, Irma and Maria before dead children become more important than the oil, gold and diamonds in the Arctic, no one knows.

Full text: HARPSWELL — A short line of black floating tubes comes into view during a boat trip around Hopkins Island in Cundy’s Harbor. While they’re large enough for passing boaters and fishermen to spot, they don’t rise out of the water much higher than a lobster buoy.
This is one of Peter Rand’s aquaculture leases. He’s among the hundreds in Maine getting involved in the burgeoning aquaculture industry, which has pumped millions into the Maine economy but is now under fire from lobstermen who compete for the same fishing grounds and homeowners who don’t want to see aquaculture sites from their waterfront properties.
The situation is coming to a head as the Department of Marine Resources holds a hearing Wednesday on whether to amend its rules to limit the size and location of aquaculture lease sites.
In March, the Department of Marine Resources received a petition with 189 signatures seeking an immediate moratorium on aquaculture leases larger than 10 acres. The petition also sought to create a new rule requiring that regulators consider alternate locations before approving aquaculture leases.
The petition triggered a rule-making process that begins with Wednesday’s hearing.
In 2017, Maine aquaculture brought in 2.8 million pounds of oysters and had an estimated $13.6 million economic impact.
That number is dwarfed by the landings value of Maine’s most famous shellfish — lobsters. Maine lobster landings were valued at a whopping $484 million in 2018.
Still, the exponential growth of Maine oysters makes it a force to be reckoned with, and its value already has eclipsed other popular fisheries along Maine’s coast, including groundfish, blue mussels and scallops.
But as the popularity and sustainability of aquaculture continue to rise along the coastline, so does controversy. Tempers have flared around a proposed 40-acre oyster farm in Maquoit Bay, with a coalition of waterfront property owners and lobster fishermen putting big money behind efforts to stymie the development. Other proposals, such as expanding an aquaculture farm in Kittery to 3.67 acres, also have faced resistance.
That opposition came to a head in March. A group known as Save Maquoit Bay submitted 189-signature petition to the Department of Marine Resources, asking it to include a new decision criteria requiring the department to consider whether any other locations near a proposed lease site could “accommodate the proposed activities while interfering less with existing and surrounding uses of an area,” according to the department.
“We support aquaculture when it is good for all parties,” said Paul Dioli, a member of Save Maquoit Bay, in a news release. “With more and more aquaculture leases flooding in, the challenge is to build an aquaculture industry that co-exists and does not compete with lobstering. Lobstermen we have talked to around the state are concerned their industry is being overlooked and hurt economically.”
“We need to seriously consider how we site these leases so aquaculture can grow, but not at the expense of the $500 million dollar lobster industry,” lobsterman John Powers said after the department agreed to host the hearing.
According to the request, the changes would allow the department to “review all aquaculture projects with a critical eye to what it means to all who use and make their living on the water.” They urged the department to “revise the outdated lease criteria and take a more holistic approach to the future of Maine’s Coastline.”
The group also asked for an immediate moratorium on all pending lease applications greater than 10 acres — the maximum lease area a person can apply for is 100 acres. They requested that the proposed rule be retroactive, so it still would apply to the application in Maquoit Bay.
“We are concerned that aquaculture leases, especially large leases that are attractive to out-of-state investors will basically eat up the bottom of the ocean floor. We are seeing more and more large leases in the water,” said Julie Eaton, secretary and treasurer of the Maine Lobstermen’s Union.
But according to Dan Devereaux, co-owner of Mere Point Oyster Co. and Brunswick’s harbor master, the proposed rule changes would only “handicap the aquaculture industry moving forward” and is a disservice not only to the industry, but to Coastal Maine and the working waterfront, he said.
Requiring the Department of Marine Resources to look into alternate locations for sites only would “pump the brakes on a system that is already going slower than it should,” he said, especially given that oyster farmers choose their sites because they are familiar with the waters.
The oyster industry is “fitting in as our other resources are dwindling,” Devereaux said, adding that as coastal communities and local lobstermen try to combat warming waters, ocean acidification and invasive species, aquaculture is one way to prevent a future of “less work and more play on the water.”
Much of the conversation around local lease battles boils down to the effect of one aquaculture owner versus the interests of coastal property owners and fishermen. That characterization, however, distorts the fact that the aquaculture farms are simply the most visible facets of an entire oyster economy that has grown up along Maine’s working waterfront.
VALUE OF OYSTERS The value of Maine oysters has skyrocketed as oyster farms have sprung up in recent years. According to landings data from the Maine Department of Marine Resources, in 2011, a total of 603,415 pounds of oyster were brought in. By 2017, oyster farmers were hauling in more than four times that number, bringing in nearly 2.8 million pounds.
That growth spurt appeared to taper off in 2018 with 2,762,941 pounds — 33,276 pounds under the previous year — but the total value of the fishery has continued to increase.
From 2004 to 2011, the total value of Maine’s oyster fishery fluctuated from $1 million to $2 million annually. In 2018, Maine’s total oyster landings were valued at an all-time high of $7.2 million.
The $7.2 million figure refers only to the value of the oysters landed, not the economic effect of all the underlying businesses that support and rely on Maine oysters. According to Chris Davis, the executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center, when taking into account that interconnected web of businesses, the economic impact of Maine oysters nearly doubles to $13.6 million for 2018.
“That’s looking at any processing, margins on wholesalers and distributors, margins on retailers and supply chain,” Davis said.
In order to meet demand, a 2016 analysis published by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute called for the total amount of acreage devoted to shellfish aquaculture to essentially double by 2030. While that’s a significant push, under those projections shellfish aquaculture would use just 0.1% of the state’s water acreage. In 2016, shellfish leases covered 0.06% of state waters.
That analysis projected that Maine oyster production will almost triple by 2030. A higher estimate shows production nearly quadrupling. For that to happen, the amount of Maine’s coastal waters being devoted to aquaculture needs to increase substantially. It’s not entirely clear how proposals to stymie or discourage some leases could affect that projected growth.
Rand’s family has owned Hopkins Island and nearby mainland property for generations, but until recently the surrounding water was mostly empty. Over the past few years, the floating black tubes cropped up in a few locations around the island and farther out in the harbor as he pursued his dream of an oyster farm, which he hopes will allow him to bring about 100,000 oysters to market annually.
Rand said he’s noticed that applying for aquaculture licenses has grown more difficult in recent years, in part, he suspects, because of pressure from the controversy surrounding projects such as the one in Maquoit Bay.
“Interestingly, it was very easy at first, but I noticed with the last two that I had here there was a little more to it,” Rand said.
For the most part, opponents of projects such as the one proposed in Maquoit Bay have emphasized that their opposition is to large-scale operations, not the smaller Limited Purpose Aquaculture licenses (LPAs) such as Rand’s. LPAs are by definition small-scale operations, limited to just 400 square feet, and have to be renewed annually. Standard leases, such as the one being pursued in Maquoit Bay, can be granted for up to 20 years and 100 acres, although in Maquoit Bay the 40-acre lease application is for 10 years and owners Devereux and Doug Niven whittled down their active space to about 28 acres and increased the size of the navigable corridors in an attempt to mollify the opposition.
Opponents have labeled such projects “factories” on the water. But according to Davis, larger oyster farms are exactly what is necessary for continued growth.
The Department of Marine Resources approved an average of 17 new leases a year in the past five years, compared to six leases approved a year on average from 2009 to 2013, the Portland Press Herald reported in March.
“The LPAs have exploded, as we know. But that only represents 1% of the growing ground. It’s 6 acres out of close to 700 acres of shellfish. It’s really a tiny percentage in terms of production, since each one is only 400 square feet,” Davis said.
The real growth, said Davis, will be when the current LPAs expand and the owners apply for standard leases, like the one being sought by Mere Point Oyster Company in Maquoit Bay.
“That’s where we’re going to see the real growth,” said Davis. “There’s only so much you can produce on an LPA.”
Restaurants, especially in Portland, have become increasingly interested in featuring Maine oysters prominently on their menus. In just the past few years, two establishments have popped up specifically to cater to the growing demand for oysters on the half shell in Portland. Rand said he sells to both The Shop and The Maine Oyster Co., both of which specialize in serving up oysters to locals and tourists alike.
While building up a strong local market for fresh oysters is important for many oyster farmers, one of the bigger goals is to grow out-of-state demand for Maine oysters. The 2016 Maine Farmed Shellfish Market Analysis notes that its best estimate for the continued growth of Maine’s oyster industry depends on expanding the reach of Maine oysters to large out-of-state markets.
A major part of that process will be building Maine oysters’ brand. Just like Maine lobsters, Maine oysters will need to develop a brand as a high-quality product, superior to oysters farmed further south.
The Gulf of Maine Research Institute analysis notes that Maine oysters should command a high price even with an increase in supply, largely because of the perceived high quality of Maine’s cold-water oysters. “They are the best oysters out there,” Rand said. “They’re terrific. There’s just a worldwide market potential for them.”

Full text: I have spent most of my life on the water employed in the commercial fishing industry, and so have generations of family and close friends. Lobstermen are a tight-knit group of men and women who work hard in a dangerous occupation — which, depending on the year, can have unpredictable rewards. We are an industry that is part of Maine’s iconic brand — the Maine lobster. The best in the world. A nearly $500 million-per-year industry.
Right now, what started as an effort to bring balance with a growing industry, aquaculture, has gotten ugly fast. I lobster in inner and outer Casco Bay. Last year we learned about an application to build a 40-acre oyster farm in rich fishing grounds in Maquoit Bay that I, along with more than a dozen lobstermen, have been fishing for decades. After we learned about it, we started attending the Department of Marine Resources hearings on the proposal and testifying to keep this section of the bay open to everyone.
Since this started, the Maine Aquaculture Association has intimated to legislators that we lobstermen are being paid for our efforts to be engaged with this process. That is not only completely untrue but also highly offensive and unhelpful, and it cuts to the heart of what we are trying to do — which is to work in cooperation with aquaculture. Not only are we not being paid, we have spent a lot of uncompensated time and own expense to simply to try to engage in this process.
I get a Department of Marine Resources notification every time someone applies for an aquaculture lease. What I typically now do is contact the applicants in the area I fish. I have spoken with some applicants who didn’t have a lot of experience and simply didn’t know that the spot they selected might cause conflict with established fisheries. So far, in two situations, we lobstermen agreed to work with them to help find a site that eliminates conflict and also provides them with what they need. With another aquaculture applicant, when I was called, I said that it was a good area for them because it wasn’t heavily fished. This is what this effort is all about from the lobstermen’s perspective – finding a workable solution.
Part of that solution has to be how DMR will address the transferability of aquaculture leases. Aquaculture is popular and growing — more than 46 aquaculture leases are currently pending. When someone gets a lease, they can transfer/sell it, and the larger the lease, the more attractive it is to larger out-of-state corporations.
We are literally selling our ocean. Everyone who fishes it, swims in it, boats on it has just lost a right they have had in favor of a business deal with the government. A side note: Lobstermen cannot sell their licenses, because it is against the law — but in aquaculture, a lease may be sold.
We urge the Department of Marine Resources to look at a better way to site these locations for aquaculture with very significant input from the commercial fishing community. The method for engaging in this process should not create a sudden burden on commercial fishermen. The burden should be placed on the state and the aquaculture applicant. Creating a healthy co-existence is our goal, not a competitive environment.
We urge DMR to consider developing across-the-board and consistent licensing policy by requiring the return of aquaculture leases to the state of Maine (just as lobster licenses must be) if someone doesn’t wants to hold them any longer, instead of selling our ocean to the highest bidder in order to let a new person in.
Finally, we urge the Maine Aquaculture Association to do some fact checking, to work with lobster fishermen and to avoid putting any further wedge between a very large and longtime, traditional fishing industry and a small but growing one.

Activists want regulators to consider alternate sites before approving new seafood farms

The public will get a chance to weigh in on tougher state rules for siting fish farms pushed by a group of activist landowners and lobster fishermen.
Organizers submitted a petition with 189 signatures last month to the Department of Marine Resources to put an immediate moratorium on aquaculture leases bigger than 10 acres and create a new rule that would make state regulators consider alternate locations before approving aquaculture leases. Petitioners got almost 40 more signatures than necessary to trigger a state rulemaking process.
Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher, in an April 10 letter to group spokeswoman Crystal Canney, said the department intends to hold a public hearing on the proposed regulations before June 1.
Demand for changes to aquaculture rules stems partially from an application from Mere Point Oyster Co. for permission to build a 40-acre oyster farm on Maquoit Bay in Brunswick. The proposal has been criticized by local landowners worried about the noise, smell and visual impact, and commercial fishermen worried it will impede access to lobster fishing waters.
Mere Point Oyster Co. has argued that its aquaculture site was chosen so it would not interfere with commercial fishing, and its owners say they are going to split their area up so boats can travel through. A company spokesman did not respond to an interview request Tuesday.
Department of Marine Resources staff held a multi-day public hearing on the company’s application this winter. The application is pending at the department.
The Brunswick proposal is the flashpoint in bubbling concerns about Maine’s fast-growing aquaculture industry. In the past five years, Maine has approved nine aquaculture leases a year, on average — compared to an average of seven leases a year approved from 2009 to 2013, according to the department. In some communities, the rapid growth of large shellfish farms has sparked opposition from nearby landowners and others.
The state’s current aquaculture evaluation process includes making sure a new lease will not interfere unreasonably with navigation, waterfront access, fishing or other uses of the area; result in unreasonable noise; or interfere with wildlife and marine habitat.

Full text: Trial in infant’s death postponed
BANGOR — The trial of a man charged with manslaughter in the death of a 6-month-old-boy in Millinocket is due to begin this week.
Jesse Mackin pleaded not guilty in 2016 in the death of Larry Lord Jr., who was the son of his girlfriend. The evidence will be heard by a judge, not a jury, at Mackin’s request. The trial begins Tuesday for Mackin, who’s was charged with manslaughter.
Mackin was living with the baby’s mother in Millinocket at the time. The baby died after being brought unresponsive to a hospital.
The baby was the son of Anthony Lord, who’s serving two life prison sentences for a shooting rampage that claimed two lives and injured four others in 2015. Lord said he was overcome with grief over his son’s death before the shootings.
Scallopers hope for better haul
PORTLAND — Maine’s scallop season is ending for the year amid hopes that fishermen had a stronger season than they did a year ago.
Fishermen harvest Maine scallops with dragger boats or by diving for the shellfish and collecting them by hand. The dragger season is over, and the dive season is finished everywhere except southern Maine, where it officially ends on April 20.
The state’s scallop fishery has rebounded from a low point in the mid-2000s, but it took a step back last year after several years of steady improvement. Fishermen harvested a little more than 560,000 pounds of scallop meat in 2018, down from more than 800,000 in 2017. The 2017 harvest was the most in 20 years.
State fishery managers said scheduled closures likely played a role in the drop.
Opening of wildlife park delayed
GRAY — The opening of a popular wildlife park in Maine will be delayed for a couple of days because of the state’s seemingly endless winter of 2019.
The Maine Wildlife Park in Gray was originally scheduled to open on Saturday, but the state said “the unseasonably cold spring and inches of snow in the last few days” have made that impossible. The park opened April 15.
Silver Airways returns to airport
BAR HARBOR — An airline that stepped in when another company canceled air service is returning to the Bar Harbor-Hancock County Airport this summer.
Brad Madeira, the airport’s manager, said Florida- based Silver Airways’ Saab SF-340B twin-engine aircraft will carry up to 34 passengers in daily trips between Bar Harbor and Boston’s Logan Airport during the busy part of the tourist season.
The Bangor Daily News reported that Alaska-based PenAir announced last May that it wasn’t renewing its contract, but Silver Airways quickly filled the void.
The airport has a year-round carrier, Cape Air, but airport officials say it’s important to have extra seats during the busy summer months.
Maine mulls latest paid leave bill
AUGUSTA — Maine could allow up to 12 weeks of paid family leave or 20 weeks of paid medical leave under a top Democrat’s bill.
The Legislature’s Labor and Housing Committee has scheduled a public hearing Friday.
Employee contributions would cover benefits and administrative costs under Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon’s bill. Employers or the state of Maine wouldn’t have to make mandatory contributions, though state funding will cover the program’s start-up costs.
Employees must have paid into the fund for at least 26 weeks in the previous year to qualify.
Employees could use family leave after the birth of a child and medical leave to address a personal medical issue. Lawmakers are considering other paid leave proposals. Supporters say if lawmakers don’t act, the matter could go to voters.
Compiled from wire reports
The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife oversees the park, which includes moose, bear and bobcats. The agency said much of the grounds at the park are still covered with snow, ice and puddles. However, park superintendent Curt Johnson said warmer and sunnier weather allowed the park to open on Monday.
Cold Maine town ready for smelts
COLUMBIA FALLS — It still feels like winter in Down East Maine, but a little town near the coast is still planning its annual tradition of heating up smelts.
The 2019 Annual Smelt Fry and Fisheries Celebration took place on Saturday in Columbia Falls. The town of about 560 residents hosted the celebration of smelts every year to raise interest in fisheries conservation.
Downeast Salmon Federation puts on the event. The group said the cold winter kept rivers iced until early April this year, but it was still able to stock up on the smelts. The little fish are typically fried and eaten whole. They’re the subject of conservation activism in Maine because of concerns about the sustainability of their population.

Full text: Missing from the ongoing conversation we Mainers are having about the proposed development of large-scale aquaculture projects in our state is an acknowledgment of the cascading benefits these projects would bring with them.
Beyond the impact of the fish they would produce, these farms would create jobs at multiple levels of our local workforce. They would promote growth in hatcheries, feed production, processing, waste reutilization, transportation, supplies, machinery, financial services and other industries.
For this and other reasons, we should welcome the aquaculture industry’s proposed investments in our state. If we are intentional and strategic, we can make Maine a hub of aquaculture production while adhering to the highest environmental and global sustainability standards.
Our Maine communities are not alone in the public discussions we are having about the future of aquaculture. Conversations like the ones in Belfast and Brunswick are occurring throughout rural areas of our coastal world. I just spent six months in Sweden, Iceland and Norway. In nearly every rural area I went, aquaculture is being viewed as part of a more sustainable economic future. In Maine, we have opportunities to transform our coastal communities into vibrant international centers of ocean farming systems excellence. In so doing, we can make them much more than seasonal tourist destinations. We can create jobs for those holding all levels of technical and college education.
I am sympathetic to, and believe we should take seriously, the concerns of our friends living in coastal communities. Aquaculture is a new concept to many. Few know about the wide diversity of jobs allied to aquaculture production, or about the local and global benefits of eating sustainably farmed seafood. Like many Mainers, I am proud to reside in a state that values the natural world and take seriously our responsibility to preserve Maine’s many wonders. And it is true that all food systems have social and ecological impacts. But Mainers must understand that the types of recirculating aquaculture systems proposed for Maine are rapidly evolving and the industry is routinely adopting technological, transportation and market advances that are dramatically decreasing aquaculture’s environmental footprint.
I believe Maine should invest in world-class education, research and outreach to become a global leader in aquaculture. We can make our state not only a center of sustainable aquaculture production but also a center of sustainable aquaculture value and expertise, one that localizes the value chain of the projects we attract.
We should emulate the best standards available and embrace the guidance given by international organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Global Aquaculture Alliance and the Aquaculture Certification Council, which reflect the high standards we need and possess the global influence to move Maine aquaculture forward to international prominence.
At the University of New England, we are playing our part by developing real-world marine aquaculture farms and a land-based recirculating training facility, and offering traditional degree programs in marine biology, as well as programs in aquaculture, marine entrepreneurship and ocean food systems. We are also connecting partners from across the North Atlantic to draw from each other’s knowledge and collaborate.
To grasp the scope of Maine’s present opportunity, we need look no farther than to Charlotte County, New Brunswick. Aquaculture has transformed this rural community marked by high unemployment and low income. Salmon aquaculture now accounts for 26 percent of its employment income, having stimulated growth far beyond production alone. About 100 aquaculture service companies now operate in St. George, supplying goods and services such as processing, nets, maintenance, transportation, packaging and equipment.
This is an important time for Maine. Companies in a burgeoning industry see our state as ideal for their operations. In making our communities hospitable to them and developing projects in environmentally sustainable ways, we can maximize the local value chains they create.
At the same time, we can capitalize on a tremendous branding opportunity. Think of “Vermont maple syrup” or “Idaho potatoes,” and the contributions they make to their states’ images. We are fortunate to already possess signature products like “Maine blueberries” and “Maine lobster.” Now we can add to our portfolio by defining Maine as a state on the cutting edge of the aquaculture industry.
“Maine salmon,” “Maine oysters” and “Maine sushi” have a nice ring to them, don’t they?

Full text: Liz Soares writes she is pleased that 'the concept of plant-based diets is entering the national conversation.'
In a well-known “Far Side” cartoon, drawn by Gary Larson, a group of cavemen triumphantly carry a huge carrot over their heads through a forest. The caption: “Early vegetarians returning from the kill.”
OK, that’s funny. But the benefits of plant-based diets aren’t.
Vegetarians and vegans are the frequent butt of jokes and derision. Last month, the “VegNews” website reported the reaction of a Fox News panel to comments made by Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker, of New Jersey. He had discussed “the environmentally damaging effects of industrial animal agriculture” in an interview with the news site. The panelists on “The Five” opinion show “attempted to belittle Booker’s stance between bites of various meat products set up on the table between them,” VegNews reported.
Meanwhile, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., tweeted a picture of herself eating a steak: “Hey, Cory Booker. I support PETA — people eating tasty animals.”
I am pleased that the concept of plant-based diets is entering the national conversation, not just through Booker’s comments but through the proposed “Green New Deal.” One of the aims of the Democratic bill is to reduce greenhouse gases, and cows are copious producers of methane. But I am tired of the silliness, such as Fox News hosts telling viewers to lock up their meat supplies.
President Trump tweeting about the Democrats eliminating all cows? Yawn. That is so 20th century.
I quit eating beef and pork in 1985, actually after receiving literature from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. I was in my 20s and had no idea how veal was produced. I was horrified to learn about the conditions in which calves were kept. After my epiphany, I cooked no poultry or fish, but I did eat it when necessary in restaurants, and when I was a guest in other people’s homes.
That was morally inconsistent, but it was the best I could do in those days.
As time passed, I found more vegetarian options. Then, later, I was able to find organic poultry that had been raised humanely, sometimes even locally.
Now I’ve swung back to eating home-cooked fish or shellfish once a week, as well as my guilty pleasure, Applegate organic turkey hot dogs. They are delicious with B&M vegetarian baked beans.
I eat a mostly plant-based diet because I believe factory-farming methods are inhumane. Why is it OK for me to keep dogs, cats and chickens as pets, coddling them, while not caring that pigs are typically raised in confinement? But I am also concerned about the environmental ramifications of our meat-centric society. North Carolina has a major pork industry, the by-products of which create a mess when there are floods — which, of course, there are more of these days, because of climate change.
Then there are all those flatulent cows.
I also think plant-based diets are healthier. The book “The Blue Zones,” by Dan Buettner, highlights places in the world where people live longer than average. One of them is Loma Linda, Calif., home to many Seventh-day Adventists. They exercise and abstain from alcohol and tobacco. Perhaps most importantly, they don’t eat meat.
I’m not quietly advocating for everyone to go veg. I want better — much better — conditions for farm animals. That is my passion. But I would really like to see a greater awareness that meat doesn’t have to be part of every meal. That’s not healthy, nor it is necessary. Chinese, Indian, Mexican and Italian cuisines all have vegetarian, and even vegan, options. There are meat alternatives that are getting better-tasting all the time. I prefer the ones that are soy-based.
Or as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a sponsor of the Green New Deal, said in her inimitable way (according to Vice News), “It’s not to say you get rid of agriculture. It’s not to say we’re going to force everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that. … It’s to say, listen, we’ve got to address factory farming. Maybe we shouldn’t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like, let’s keep it real.”
Sorry, Sean Hannity, your scare tactics are passé. Lately, when I’ve been registering for work-related workshops or conferences, the “vegan” option has started popping up on the menu. The other day, in my own school district, on a professional development day, the veggie pizza ran out before I could get any. It was that popular.
I’m on the planning committee for an annual librarians’ conference, and last year, there was a minor uproar when the vegan soup disappeared too quickly, leaving only the alternative soup. This year, the soup will be strictly vegan.
And that’s no joke.

Lobster industry wants cap on aquaculture sites

Full text: Lobstermen and concerned citizens submit a petition to the state to halt new aquaculture leases and put more restrictions on where new aquaculture leases should be sited.
Lobstermen are among the organizers of a citizen petition asking the state to limit where new aquaculture operations are sited in Maine’s coastal waters, claiming the surge in new licenses affects where they can drop traps.
A wave of aquaculture operations has swept along the coast in the last few years, sparking concerns from lobstermen and others about waterfront access, aesthetics and interference with commercial fisheries.
A 40-acre oyster farm proposed in Maquoit Bay in Brunswick by Mere Point Oyster Co. is a flashpoint in the debate. The hearing on its application prompted three days of prolonged, contentious discussion, involving landowners in the upscale neighborhood of Merepoint, members of the town’s fishing community and others.
“I’m here to let the Department of Marine Resources know that their system of granting aquaculture leases is broken or even worse, non-existent, as far as it pertains to the commercial lobstermen in this state,” John Powers, a lobsterman who has fished around Brunswick for 40 years, said Wednesday at a news conference in the State House.
Powers was among a handful of organizers who submitted a petition with 189 signatures to the Department of Marine Resources, almost 40 more signatures than needed to trigger the rule-making process.
The department’s current aquaculture evaluation process includes making sure a new lease will not interfere unreasonably with navigation, waterfront access, fishing or other uses of the area; result in unreasonable noise; or interfere with wildlife and marine habitat.
Petitioners want an immediate statewide moratorium on pending lease applications bigger than 10 acres. A map of the state aquaculture operations shows several larger than 10 acres, but a DMR spokesman was unable to provide an exact number.
They also want the state to add rules that would allow it to consider whether a nearby location or different lease boundaries would balance competing water uses better.
The group wants its rules to be retroactive to the pending Mere Point Oyster Co. lease application.
“I ask the DMR to listen carefully to the generations of men and women who have made the lobster industry what it is today and protect our livelihood from what has become nothing more than a land grab in upper Casco Bay,” Powers said.
Julie Eaton, who fishes for lobster from Stonington and is head of the Maine Lobstering Union, worries that rich people from out-of-state would use big aquaculture leases to deny ocean access to people who have relied on it for decades, specifically the lobster industry, Maine’s most valuable fishery.
“It’s time for thoughtful reconsideration of the rules to protect one of Maine largest industries — the lobstering industry,” Eaton said at the news conference Wednesday.
But Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, said the petition is just a smokescreen to drum up opposition to the Mere Point project. New leases already are prohibited from places with active commercial fisheries under current law, he said.
The petitioners are using a few local fishermen to mask opposition to the Mere Point Oyster Co. project from a local landowner concerned the project will ruin his view, not fearing it will affect the fishing industry, Belle added.
“Because under the existing system there are no criteria that would deny an application for visual impact, (the landowner) has had to go and pit commercial fishermen against aquaculture,” Belle said. “We have never seen the commercial fishing industry used as a proxy for wealthy landowners before, and that is obviously what is going on here.”
A Department of Marine Resources spokesman said the state first must confirm that the petition complies with Maine law, and if it does, the state can begin the rule-making process within 60 days.
Dan Devereaux, Brunswick harbor master and a partner in of Mere Point Oyster Co., said the company picked its site specifically because it did not conflict with lobstering or other fisheries.
The company also has shrunk its active area to about 28 acres and agreed to have east-west and north-south corridors to allow other fishermen to access the site, Devereaux said.
The driving issue is coastal landowners concerned with losing their views, not threats to fishermen, Devereaux added.
A group called Save Maquoit Bay has organized against the proposed lease, calling it a “floating factory.”
“Trying to package it up and couch it with creating fear from lobstermen that we are taking over the waters is ludicrous in my opinion,” Devereaux said.
Mere Point’s lease application went through its public hearing process this winter and awaits a final decision from the Department of Marine Resources. If the lease is approved, Mere Point Oyster Co. plans to grow from 350,000 oysters this year to 1 million in 2021.
“It’s too bad. It seems like the beef is with Mere Point Oyster Co., and the rule change they are asking for would impact aquaculture development up and down the coast of Maine,” Devereaux said.
Aquaculture is regarded by many as a crucial way to preserve and grow Maine’s commercial fisheries in the face of rapid changes to the ecosystem such as warming sea water and ocean acidification, which threaten natural stocks.
In the past five years, aquaculture operations have blossomed along the Maine coast.
The Department of Marine Resources approved an average of 17 new leases a year in the last five years, compared to six leases approved a year on average from 2009 to 2013, according to a review of department lease decisions.
American oysters have emerged as the pre-eminent crop for new aquaculture companies. Oysters grown in Maine waters are highly sought after by chefs and restaurants across the U.S. and Canada, and they fetch higher prices than those from other parts of the country.
The value of Maine’s farmed oysters more than doubled in five years, from about $3.1 million in 2013 to $7.2 million in 2017, according to state records.

Full text: After years of inaction, the U.S. Congress appears poised to direct federal authorities to assess the risk posed to coastal communities and fishing and aquaculture interests by ocean acidification, a byproduct of global warming that represents a potentially catastrophic threat to harvesters in Maine. Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democrat representing Maine’s first district, on Thursday reintroduced a bill directing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work with state and local experts to assess the likely impacts of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge.
Problem affects shell growth of clams, oysters and others, threatening marine harvesters
After years of inaction, Congress appears poised to direct federal authorities to assess the risk posed to coastal communities and fishing and aquaculture interests by ocean acidification, a byproduct of global warming that represents a potentially catastrophic threat to harvesters in Maine.
Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democrat representing Maine’s 1st District, reintroduced a bill Thursday directing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work with state and local experts to assess the likely impacts of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge.
The bill, first introduced more than three years ago, never received so much as a hearing while Republicans controlled the U.S. House, despite bipartisan support, including that of then-Rep. Bruce Poliquin, the Republican from Maine’s 2nd District. With Democrats now in the majority, Pingree is bullish on the bill’s prospects.
“We’ve had eight years with Republican control of the House where we didn’t even have legislative hearings on these things or debate on the floor,” she told the Press Herald. “Now there’s a very good chance that something like this will move, as it’s not something I’ve had to struggle with to get Republicans to support.”
Pingree’s bill, the Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act, directs NOAA to prepare a public report on which communities are most exposed to the problem, identify gaps in knowledge that need to be filled, and support state efforts to assess their own vulnerabilities. The bill has six co-sponsors, half of whom are Republicans representing coastal districts. (Rep. Jared Golden, the Democrat who replaced Poliquin, is not among them, but his spokesman, Nick Zeller, said the congressman fully supports the bill and intends to be a co-sponsor.)
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Thursday reintroduced her companion bill in the Senate, co-sponsored by Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins and two Democrats, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.
“If we don’t develop the tools we need to assess and respond, our coastal communities will be hit the hardest by ocean acidification,” Murkowski said in a statement. “The reality is our ocean is becoming more acidic and will impact our ocean resources, coastal communities, and beyond if we don’t take proactive steps to address it.”
Collins said via email that it is “critical that we learn more about the impact of ocean acidification in order to protect the environment, our way of life, and Maine’s economy” and that she also supports “robust funding” for NOAA’s Ocean Acidification Program, which studies the problem.
Sen. Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said via email that ocean acidification poses a serious threat to the state’s ecosystems and coastal industries. “We must develop long-term strategies that combat ocean acidification and work every day to mitigate the impacts of climate change so we can support the livelihood of Maine families, and protect our environment for future generations,” King said. “I applaud this bipartisan effort, and am planning to support it as the process ensues.”
Ocean acidification is linked to the increased carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere, which are more than 70 percent higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution, and now stand at the highest level in at least 800,000 years. The levels would be worse but for the fact that the oceans absorb some of that additional carbon dioxide. However, that has caused them to become 30 percent more acidic over this period, conditions that interfere with the chemical processes by which clams, oysters and other organisms grow their shells.
Researchers in the Gulf of Maine have documented that free-floating, soft-shell clam larvae avoid burrowing into more acidic mud, which means they spend more time exposed to predators as they seek appropriate habitat; that acidic water conditions stunt clam growth; and that baby oysters have so much trouble building their first shells in acid conditions they often die before they’re completed. The effects on lobster, Maine’s most valuable fishery, remain unclear pending additional research.
Maine lawmakers are also upbeat about prospects for action on the state level.
Rep. Lydia Blume, a York Democrat, said her bill to convene another science advisory panel to look at the impact of climate change on Maine’s marine species is headed for committee review. A second one that would establish a commission to identify physical climate change threats to Maine’s coast, like those resulting from sea level rise and more intensive storm activity, is expected to be rolled into a larger climate bill being drafted by Gov. Janet Mills’ staff.
“These efforts are looking very positive, and it looks like the governor is staying true to her word on putting together a comprehensive plan,” Blume said. “To my mind, this requires an all-out effort by every aspect of the state’s departments.”

Full text: Former priest’s sentencing delayed
ALFRED — The sentencing of a former Massachusetts priest for sexually assaulting an altar boy on trips to Maine years ago has been pushed back to late March.
Ronald Paquin was found guilty of 11 of 24 counts of gross sexual misconduct in November. Court officials said he’s scheduled to be sentenced at York County Superior Court in Alfred on March 29 at 9 a.m.
Paquin was initially scheduled for sentencing on Tuesday, but court officials said the date was extended.
A pair of men who testified during Paquin’s trial said they were altar boys when the priest invited them on trips in the 1980s and assaulted them repeatedly.
Paquin previously spent more than 10 years in a prison in Massachusetts for sexually abusing an altar boy in that state.
LePage: Whites need Electoral College
BANGOR — Former Gov. Paul LePage said any elimination of the Electoral College would hurt white people.
LePage told WVOM radio that allowing the popular vote to choose the president would give minorities more power and that “white people will not have anything to say.”
Proposals to eliminate the Electoral College are sometimes floated but fail to gain traction. A Maine legislative committee plans to discuss a proposal this week.
LePage said cutting the Electoral College would mean there is never another presidential candidate from small states like “Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Wyoming, Montana, Rhode Island.”
While governor, LePage blamed out-of-state, minority dealers for bringing drugs into Maine and added that they often impregnate “young, white” girls while in Maine.
Abandoned bear cub now doing well
EDINGBURG — A wildlife biologist said one of the bear cubs that nearly froze to death is doing well after being placed with a surrogate den.
The Bangor Daily News documented Randy Cross as he checked on the cub Wednesday. He easily recognized the young bruin because of signs of frostbite on the tips of its ears.
Then the cub was placed back in the den.
Three cubs were placed in new dens after being abandoned Jan. 31 when a piece of logging machinery passed close to their den. Their mother fled the ruckus, and didn’t immediately return, and the logger contacted the Maine Warden Service for help.
The cub that was checked on Wednesday was placed in Edinburg. The other two were placed with a mother bear in Orneville.
Jackson Labs joins Sanofi on research
BAR HARBOR — A laboratory is announcing a multimillion-dollar collaboration with pharmaceutical giant Sanofi to try to tackle two kinds of cancer.
Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor said Thursday it has signed a research agreement for up to $4.2 million with Sanofi to identify new targets to treat triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian carcinoma.
The lab describes triple-negative as the most deadly form of breast cancer, and ovarian cancer as ranking fifth in cancer deaths among women.
Jackson Laboratory professor Jacques Banchereau said the laboratory is hopeful its work will lead to a new therapy that helps patients suffering from the cancers. Jackson Laboratory said Banchereau’s lab uses unique computational algorithms to inform cancer research work.
The lab said the approach could facilitate “more targeted and effective treatments” for disease.
New England fish forum kicks off
ROCKPORT — New England’s largest fishing industry trade show is getting started with a focus on the region’s shellfish business.
Thursday was the first day of the 2019 Maine Fishermen’s Forum. The event runs through Saturday. Organizers said Thursday was the event’s “Shellfish Focus Day.”
The day included seminars about outreach and education in the shellfish industry, as well as about shellfish science and management of shellfish species. The shellfish business is a major piece of the fishing industry in New England, where fishermen harvest scallops, softshell clams, quahogs are other valuable species from the Atlantic Ocean and coastal areas. Maine fishing regulators are expected to release new data about the state’s valuable lobster haul during the three-day forum.

Full text: Your Dec. 16 lead editorial, "Our View: Aquaculture wrong target for protests," misses the mark.
We who oppose the construction of a massive industrial fish farm in Belfast didn't file suit to kill the project by delay -- we filed suit because the Belfast City Council illegally changed our long-standing zoning laws to accommodate the highly destructive Nordic Aquafarms industrial fish farm project.
The editorial poses a false choice between one polluting industry, land-based industrial aquaculture, and other polluting industries such as poultry. But there are alternatives. The Green Wave kelp-based aquaculture model actually renews our beleaguered oceans and provides far more jobs per dollar invested.
Industrial fish production is not the most efficient or sustainable way to feed a hungry and growing human population, not even close. Kelp, shellfish, actively supported wild-fish harvesting and organic plant-based protein such as soy are all much more efficient and sustainable.
Industrial fish production has an extensive carbon footprint. Its effluent discharge creates algae blooms and large dead zones in our seas.
It requires the importation from Asia and South America of large quantities of forage fish, which decimates fish populations in those areas, and it requires the importation of pesticide-laced soy from industrial soy farms that are destroying the Amazon.
The editorial touts jobs and financial benefit, but here in Belfast, Nordic Aquafarms has made at least 30 hires, none of whom was living in Belfast when hired. Any tax benefits will be minimized by a veritable smorgasbord of tax-incentive programs and giveaways and a reduction in state education aid.
And profits from the project will flow out of our community and into the coffers of a foreign corporation.
All told, this big industrial model is the wrong way forward for our community.

Full text: Christmas, New Year's busiest time for Harbor Fish Market
In the hectic countdown to Christmas, it's well-known that stores, shopping malls and groceries are going to be thronged with people doing their final rounds before the holiday.
A seafood market doesn't immediately jump to mind as someplace that would have shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. But that's exactly what greeted anyone walking through the front door of Harbor Fish Market on Custom House Wharf in Portland on Sunday morning.
The weeks leading up to Christmas and New Year's are the busiest period of the year at the store, said owner Mike Alfiero.
"When this time of year comes, people go on a buying frenzy," Alfiero said.
Some of the demand is linked to traditions such as like the multi-course fish feast his Italian-American family enjoyed when he was growing up, Alfiero said. For others, it is an excuse to indulge in some special holiday foods.
"It is the one time of year when people, as much as they can afford it, drop their guards on how much they are willing to spend," he said.
The store was so busy Sunday morning that a policeman and employee dressed in a Santa costume were directing traffic into parking spaces on the narrow wharf.
Inside, customers crowded around glass cases lined with ice, succulent cuts of fish and piles of oysters, clams, mussels and shrimp. Employees scooped live lobsters from huge, gurgling saltwater tanks.
A line of about 20 people, plastic bags weighted down with their selections, waited to check out at the counter. The lengthy line barely changed, as a steady stream of customers jockeyed for standing space on the damp concrete floors. Workers hustled to weigh purchases and lugged ice and fish from the back warehouse into the front.
Today, Christmas Eve, will likely be even busier, with customers lining up before the store opens at 7 a.m. The market brings on about 10 temporary employees to deal with the rush. Alfiero could not estimate how much fish the market sells during the holiday season, but the store does the same sales in the two weeks around Christmas and New Year's as it does during a busy month in the summer.
Chris Anderson, 37, was picking out three dozen oysters and two dozen clams for a holiday dinner. His sister-in-law Chelsea Obourn, was bringing some home with her to Rochester, New York.
Christmas seafood isn't really a tradition in her family, but her grandfather has a soft spot for oysters, Obourn said. Most of the oyster selections were from Maine, but she made sure to get some from Wellfleet, Massachusetts, near where he owned a beach home.
"My grandpa loves it," she said. "He has had some health problems, but it is one of the only things he has an appetite for anymore."
It is not unusual to have a lot of out-of-state customers over the holidays, Alfiero said. Some people make the trip to Portland year after year, bringing generations to select premium fresh seafood the market is known for.
"A lot of people see coming here and shopping in the store as a tradition," he said.
The weathered row of buildings along Custom House Wharf has been a fish market since the late 1800s. The Alfiero family bought the business in 1966 and Mike Alfiero now runs it with his brother Nick.
Some customers are coming in to prepare for the Feast of the Seven Fishes, a holiday tradition for Italian-American families like his own, Alfiero said. The idea is to serve seven different seafood dishes, or seafood prepared seven different ways, for Christmas dinner. The precise origin of the tradition is unclear, but it likely developed among Italian immigrant families in the U.S. It is rooted in the Roman Catholic custom of not eating meat before important holidays.
For Alfiero's family, Christmas meant dishes such as stuffed squid, fried eels, baccalà -- salt cod -- salad, fish cakes and anchovy pasta. These days, the menu for his big family dinner skews more to meat and less to the sea, Alfiero added.
Heritage aside, seafood keeps growing in popularity and around the winter holidays, demand reaches a fever pitch.
"For Christmas, it is high volume on everything -- there isn't anything we are not selling a lot of," Alfiero said.

Full text: HARPSWELL -- Harpswell will be home to one of the state's few commercial oyster hatcheries after selectmen approved a lease with Running Tide Technologies Inc., a South Portland company looking to open a hatchery at Mitchell Field early next year.
The town has been meeting with the company since late September to hammer out a lease for a 1.33-acre parcel of the town's marine business district at the site of the former Navy fuel depot. The property includes a garage and a concrete slab that Running Tide Technologies Inc. hopes to transform into a hatchery. According to the company's owner, Marty Odelin, Mitchell Field is an ideal location for the operation.
"The reason why we like Mitchell Field is it's super-quiet (and has) nice clean water, and for hatching oysters, you want it to be quiet and you want really clean water," Odelin said. "Everything we do is going to be trying to maximize how quiet and clean it is."
While oyster farming has been a growing industry over the past few years, the state has only two commercial hatcheries, according to the Department of Marine Resources. One is in Walpole-Damariscotta and the other in Bremen. Oyster farmers rely on the hatcheries for seed, which they then grow over multiple years until the oysters reach market size.
Running Tide Technologies Inc. has four aquaculture leases, all in Harpswell.
"We're essentially a shellfish farming company, and it might be more accurate to call us a 'picks and shovels' company of shellfish farming. Our plan is to build equipment and to provide seed etc., and have our own farms and supply to other people as well," Odelin said.
According to the lease agreed on last week, Running Tides Technology Inc. will pay just over $6,000 per year in rent to the town for the property, starting at $6,107 in the first year, with incremental increases until the rent reaches $6,874 in the fifth year.
As part of its lease, the company will renovate the building, which needs repairs after years of underuse.
Odelin said the company would spend around $180,000 to renovate the garage into a "state-of-the-art" facility. Their total budget, which includes installing equipment, repaving a concrete slab and running the intake pipe, comes out to around $500,000, he said.
The company will run an intake pipe from the ocean north of the jetty into the facility to provide water for the hatchery. Water will be treated before being discharged back into the ocean. The company also plans to set up a kelp farm at the end of the intake pipe to help clean the water, reducing turbidity and acidity in the water while adding oxygen.
"The water out here is fantastic. It's as good as it gets," Odelin said. "It's exactly in the right target range for salinity, and it's very consistent."
The company plans to complete renovations and begin operations by March 1, though it already has one eye on expansion.
As part of the lease, the company has the option of expanding to an adjacent 3.85-acre parcel to the east. Odelin said if the company exercised that option, it would be looking to build greenhouses to grow feed for the seed and possibly grow more oysters in that area. There is a public access road in that parcel, and if the company expands into that area, it will relocate the road at its own expense.
The company also has floated ideas about kayak and outdoor equipment rentals, as well as oyster cookouts and a tasting area on site.
"We hope to be a good tenant and neighbor of Mitchell Field," Odelin said. "Our goal for Mitchell Field is just to have the hatchery and then potentially long-term to be growing some feed in a greenhouse."
In their closing comments, the selectmen noted their appreciation for the size of the project.
"Over the years, we've had a number of opportunities come before us -- some quite large; some, controversial. This one is small with a potential to grow very nicely," Selectman David I. Chipman said. "It fits so nicely in there. I'm very happy to support it."

Full text: A Brunswick-based nonprofit sees a possible development moratorium on Portland's waterfront as a test case for competing coastal uses in communities across Maine.
"Portland is a bellwether city. Whatever happens in Portland will have a ripple effect across the state," said Monique Coombs, director of marine programs at Maine Coast Fishermen's Association, an industry-led group that advocates for inshore fishermen.
The Portland City Council is set to vote Monday on a six-month moratorium on new commercial construction on the water side of Commercial Street, where most of the city's piers and wharves are.
The construction ban is a response to a citizen referendum that, if passed, would prohibit any waterfront development that did not have a direct water use.
Fishermen fear they are being pushed aside by new development aimed at growing tourism, including a luxury hotel proposed on Fisherman's Wharf. Pier owners, however, say they are trying to keep the working waterfront alive with cheap berthing fees for fishermen, but need new revenue to pay for expensive wharf upkeep.
The fishermen's association hasn't taken a public stance but did support referendum backers with media and organizing help.
Up and down the coast, fishermen, private landowners and developers are debating coastal access, tourism-related development and expanded aquaculture businesses, Coombs said. In Brunswick, waterview homeowners and some lobstermen are battling a proposed oyster farm; a proposal to build a salmon farm in Belfast is dividing that community; and Bar Harbor just concluded a battle over expanding pier access for cruiseships.
Portland's moratorium, which gives all sides time to address problems with waterfront zoning, enforcement and other issues, may be a good model for other coastal towns and cities dealing with those contests, said Coombs.
"We think that sets a good precedent for other communities to look at their ordinances and work with fishermen to plan out their future," Coombs said. "We want a lot of communities to be looking at their working waterfront."
Fishermen behind the petition drive said on Friday they "conditionally support" the moratorium, but will continue gathering signatures until the moratorium passes and the city shows its commitment to solve waterfront problems.
"We look forward to working with the city, wharf owners, and other waterfront merchants to find long-term solutions that will lead to preserving the viability of the working waterfront," said Willis Spear, a lobsterman and lead organizer, in a written statement. "If it becomes apparent that realistic measures to protect the working waterfront are not moving forward during the moratorium period, we will be back to renew our referendum efforts."
Petitioners need to get 1,500 signatures by Jan. 18 to put the referendum on the ballot.
Portland City Manager Jon Jennings announced the moratorium Wednesday, along with statements of support from two pier owners. The city wants to avoid a successful referendum that would cement strict zoning rules for five years and deal with lingering concerns about the waterfront central zone. The zone was created in the 1990s to protect the working waterfront from an incursion of condominiums and other construction, but was amended eight years ago to allow more commercial development.
Petitioners "can certainly have faith in the city that once the moratorium is passed on Monday, we'll get to work right away and start tackling issues that have accumulated over the last several years that will address their concerns and make it work, not just for them but for the pier owners," Jennings said Friday.
The Portland moratorium is being watched closely in Boothbay Harbor, where organizers are fighting a proposal to rezone part of the town's maritime zone and allow hotels, restaurants and other tourist-based development. The proposal has split the town between those who encourage investment and economic development and others, like Ken Fitch, who worry a way of life is being dismantled.
"There are similarities to what is happening in Portland and here, just differences in scale," said Fitch, a spokesman for Friends of the Harbor, a group against the zoning change.
"It is the same principle, you have diminishing waterfront for maritime interests and it is becoming more and more geared toward tourism and hotels," Fitch said.
"Little by little it is being chipped away," Fitch said. "It is a little frightening for us, there are really alarm bells for people that we may lose this forever."

Full text: Use carbon tax to save planet
The Morning Sentinel and Kennebec Journal deserve special praise for giving front-page coverage to the latest report on climate change, part of the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a government report produced every four years ("Changing climate to put further pressure on New England, federal report predicts," Nov. 24). It details the significant impacts already being observed here in Maine.
The Climate Assessment gives information about warming temperatures, increased precipitation and bigger storms; the likelihood of serious contamination by flooding; the fishing industry's gloomy forecast; and acidification of ocean waters predicting the demise of the shellfish industry, etc.
Northeastern states have already seen the greatest changes, and more are predicted. As Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, noted, "Steps must be taken to reduce climate warming emissions."
U.S. Sen. Angus King's comments go further and are worth repeating: "As today's report makes abundantly clear, we are grossly failing ourselves and our children in the face of an increasingly dangerous threat. It's time to listen to the scientists who have for decades warned of the serious consequences of climate change for our economy, our ecosystems and our national defense. Generations of future Americans will judge us harshly for anything less than a full response to this crisis -- not a denial, not excuses, not equivocation. We need to act. We need to act now."
So what action should be taken? The answer is to put a price on the very thing that is causing climate change, namely emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels -- coal, oil and natural gas -- something we rely on for almost everything we do.
This week, a bipartisan bill, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, was introduced in Congress. It would do just that. It proposes to put an economywide price on all fossil fuels at their source, the coal mine or oil well or gas well. The price would start at $15 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions (which would add about 15 cents on a gallon of gasoline) and increase annually at $10 per year. Call it a "pollution tax" if you will.
However, instead of adding to government coffers, all revenue would be returned to the economy as an equal dividend to all adults, with half dividends for children (up to two per household). Your first dividend check would come prior to the first tax being imposed. Call the monthly dividend a "climate security check" if you like.
Pricing carbon fuels will incentivize industry and commerce to innovate in how they manufacture goods and get them to market. Alternative energy sources will become cheaper over time as the price of fossil fuels increases. Free market competition will determine which products get to market cheaper.
Yes, some items will become more expensive, but the dividend will allow us to choose alternatives ourselves, as well as rethinking energy efficiency throughout our lives. You too are part of the free market.
Milton Friedman had similar thoughts about reducing pollution. His notion was to "impose a tax on the amount of pollutants emitted by a car, thus making it in the self-interest of car manufacturers and consumers to keep down pollution."
Friedman was a champion of small government, the kind that holds people accountable when something they're doing negatively affects others not involved. If there is no such accountability, polluters hide the true costs of their products or actions by dumping -- yes, literally dumping -- waste into the environment, via smokestacks and vehicle exhausts, polluting the air we breathe.
More recently, Yale Professor William Nordhaus won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his detailed analyses showing that a carbon tax is by far the most effective way to lower carbon emissions. It is more efficient than using government controls such as regulating emission standards for vehicles and power plants. For comparison, raising the price of tobacco reduced smoking.
So how far does this get us in cutting carbon emissions and slowing climate change? The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report spelled out the urgency of keeping global temperature increase to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius. It called for reducing emissions 50 percent by 2030. The new bill before Congress comes very close. So, Congress, get it done!

Full text: Tim Johnson's pitch for his ax-throwing class is simple and direct.
"Ever felt the urge to chuck an ax across the room?" he asks on the web page for his business, Maine Warrior Gym in Westbrook. "Now you can!"
Johnson's main business is ninja-style training classes for kids. The ax-throwing is a sideline.
But it's become an unexpectedly popular sideline. Gift certificates for Johnson's ax-throwing -- $35 for an introductory session, with a choice of axes and tomahawks -- are a popular gift choice, he said, for the holidays or life events.
"We've had bachelorette parties and we've had divorce parties," all centered on ax-throwing, he said.
It's also an example of a growing trend of experiential gift-giving. Instead of another sweater, proponents said, why not give a loved one a thoughtful gift that will create a memory?
"It's something we push a lot," Johnson said. "Experiences are more fulfilling and don't take up as much space in the closet."
Maddy Purcell pushes experiential gifts as well. Her business -- Fyood (pronounced "feud") Kitchen -- sells an experience similar to the "Chopped" TV show, with participants striving to create a tasty dish from a set of ingredients, even if they're not familiar with those foods. But she also believes giving experiences as a gift is a fast-growing trend.
That led her to put together a small gift guide, the Experience Maine Gift Guide, with links to other businesses that sell experiences, such as Johnson's ax-throwing classes and oyster farm tasting tours and disc golf passes.
Research from the Wharton School of Economics backs Purcell up. Scholars found that not only is spending on experiential gifts growing faster than spending on traditional gifts, but both the giver and recipient are happier with those choices.
"There's this double gift involved," Purcell said.
Wharton professor Cassie Mogilner, whose research was published in a paper co-authored with Cindy Chan, a professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto Scarborough, said it's clear that people are much happier, and that happiness is lasting, when people treat themselves to a nice dinner or going on vacation or going to a concert, rather than buying the latest electronic gadget or a piece of jewelry.
"We ran a bunch of studies and found that when recipients receive an experience, regardless of whether they share in that experience with the gift-giver, they feel more connected to the gift-giver as a result of it, compared to receiving a material gift," said Mogilner in an interview posted on Wharton's website.

Acadia Mountain Guides Climbing School in Bar Harbor is one of the companies participating in the Maine experiential gift guide. It offers gift certificates for things such as a daylong hike up Mount Washington for $150 and a two-day trek up Mount Katahdin for $225 to weeklong hut-to-hut cross-country skiing trips that start at about $1,150.
Amanda Hatley, the company's retail manager, said other popular choices include avalanche rescue training programs, which are often given as gifts from family members who want to make sure loved ones know what to do in the backcountry.
"It's great to know this information, especially if you're on Mount Katahdin or Tuckerman Ravine in the winter," Hatley said.
She said grandparents often spring for a summer camp gift certificate for their grandkids.
"We have a lot of gift-giving that goes on over here," Hatley said.
Purcell said the outdoor adventures are emblematic of the experiential gift-giving trend. Millennials, she said, are particularly attentive to their effect on the world, and that includes what they do around the holidays.
"There's an emphasis on conscientious consumerism," she said. "People are spending more on events and experiences than on other things."
A survey by the National Retail Federation last February of more than 7,000 respondents found that 42 percent of consumers would prefer an experiential Valentine's Day gift, rather than a material gift. People ages 25 to 34 were much more likely to give an experiential gift, the survey found.
That is also borne out by Mogilner's research.
"There's a lot of talk right now about how (millennials) share these life narratives that they're telling through their experiences, and they're posting these really cool experiences on Facebook," she said. "So there's more awareness of the value of experiences, and maybe gift-givers might be a little more likely to give experiences."
Social media also plays a role that could benefit the businesses. Purcell said most of the people who take part in Fyood post photos and videos of the event online, spreading word of her business via valuable word-of-mouth publicity, she said.
An experience gift also can be a gentle nudge, said Stephanie Harmon, the owner of Hustle and Flow, a dance and exercise studio in Portland.
The certificates for Hustle and Flow classes, she said, are usually bought "by people who have been talking about it with a friend or partner and have been talking about it for a while."
Buying a certificate for a friend is a way to ensure that the giver and the recipient finally will take a fitness class, she said.
Gift certificates are good for her company's financial health, Harmon added, with a boost in revenue at the end of the year and the likelihood that at least some of the recipients will sign up for more than what the certificate covers.
"It's definitely nice around the holidays. There's a little extra boost," she said.

Full text: Oyster company lays out plans for 40-acre expansion at start of marathon two-day hearing in Brunswick
BRUNSWICK — A marathon public hearing over Mere Point Oyster Co.’s proposed 40-acre lease on Maquoit Bay will carry over into next week after nearly four hours of discussion and debate Thursday night.
On Monday night, opponents of the expansion will chime in.
The Department of Marine Resources is conducting the hearing to determine if Mere Point Oyster Co.’s proposed expansion, which would increase its annual oyster harvest from about 60,000 to up to 1.5 million in the next three years, meets state requirements. Those include factors such as interference with navigation, fishing and other uses, and noise and visual effects, among others. That is much of which a group known as the opposition — Maquoit Bay Preservation Group — is concerned about.
Doug Niven and Brunswick harbormaster Dan Devereaux own and operate the 26 aquaculture sites that make up Mere Point Oyster Co. Niven touted oysters as a valuable ecological resource that could add “resiliency along the Brunswick coastline” with their ability to filter water. Their business, if expanded, would allow younger generations to continue working on the water, they said.
They’re being represented at the hearings by attorneys Patrick Lyons and Andrew Hamilton.
Dana Smith, owner of Smith Boatyard, hauls docks and ramps through the bay, often going through the proposed lease site, he said.
He said he didn’t think the oyster farm operation would interfere with his navigation. People still would be able to kayak, water-ski, use personal watercraft and pass through the area.
The lease application details a 5-acre nursery for up to 2 million seed oysters, a 10-acre intermediate area for oysters in the early to middle stages of growth, and 20 acres for the full-grown oysters and for sinking the cages during the winter. An additional 5-acre “experimental” area would be used for scallops and quahogs, and would be submerged year round.
If they consolidated all their gear into one corner of the lease, it would take up about 1.5 acres, maybe a little more, Devereaux said. There are corridors through the site, nearly 12 acres, that are empty of equipment that sailboats and fishermen would easily be able to travel through, he and Niven agreed.
Jon Lewis, Department of Marine Resources aquaculture program director, asked if they anticipated power-washing their gear often, as the lease stated they would be doing so on-site instead of on the shore, as they do now. Niven said they flip the cage twice per month to keep build-up from forming. Doing that minimizes the need for power-washing, which would flush that build-up back into the water. Much of the power-washing would be done in the fall, outside the peak season for seagrass.
Mills also addressed the concern, bringing up “best practices” from the East Coast Shellfish Growing Association and the Maine Aquaculture Association, which both recommend washing gear on shore and not on the water.
However, Niven argued that he had spoken with the shellfish growing association president and they had agreed that in Maquoit Bay there was more tidal flushing, and it was not as much of a problem.
Alyssa Novak, a coastal ecologist with a specialty in seagrass, testified that the lease would not affect eelgrass — a form of underwater vegetation that provides habitat for marine life and helps combat erosion. Eelgrass does exist in the bay, she said, but the site itself doesn’t have any and is unsuitable for it to return because of water quality, water depth and the sediments that are not the species’ preferred mud or clay. She did recommend, however, that if Niven and Devereaux plan to power-wash on site to clean their gear, that they do it with the outgoing tide as a precautionary measure.
Mills asked Novak a number of times — and in multiple ways — whether, hypothetically, if eelgrass were to be found in the area, she would recommend action or for the moorings to be moved. Since she had stated that the area was not conducive for eelgrass growth, Novak refused to comment on hypothetical situations.
Lewis asked if she thought the water quality both in and out of the lease site would improve with the oysters filtering water — up to 50 gallons per day for a single oyster. It was hard to say at this point, Novak said, but she hoped so.
The majority of the opposition’s testimony is scheduled for Monday, but because of a scheduling conflict, intervenor David Clark expressed concerns over the ingress and egress, and if an expansion would “increase unsanctioned use of the recreational boat launch.”
Mere Point Oyster Co. has been using a recreational ramp for commercial launching, he alleged, which the DMR would have to handle.
A few people who are unavailable Monday also were permitted to speak during public comment, including Susan Olcott, who said she has worked closely with Niven and Devereaux over the years, but she opposes the scope of the project. It could have effects in coastal communities across Maine if this becomes the standard, she said, adding that smaller-scale aquaculture, which already has community support, would be the more appropriate way to do it.
Elizabeth Butler, however, held the opposite view and said the lease was an important step in helping to rebuild the bay as a working marine waterfront and provide jobs for the community and the next generation.
Mere Point Oyster Co. will finish its testimony when the hearing continues at 6 p.m. Monday at Brunswick High School’s Crooker Theatre. At that time, the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group offer its testimony. A second group of intervenors, commercial fishermen, also will testify. If needed, additional hearing dates will be scheduled.

Full text: Mere Point Oyster Co. currently operates on about 1/4 acre in Brunswick's Maquoit Bay, but hopes to expand to 40-acres. But area residents are upset about the plans, largely because of its planned size.
Neighbors opposing Mere Point Oyster Co. expansion
BRUNSWICK — Signs calling to “Stop the oyster factory” line Mere Point Road, dotting dozens of tree trunks and property lines on the roadsides leading all the way to the boat launch. The subject of residents ire: an unassuming business based out of a large red barn known as the Mere Point Oyster Co., now in its third year, which operates on about a quarter-acre on Maquoit Bay.
That small operation might not be so small for much longer. Its owner has submitted a 40-acre lease application. Doug Niven and Dan Deveraux hope their company will grow up to 1.5 million oysters per year by 2021 and have a “maximum stocking density” of 5 million by 2023.
The expansion proposal has angered some in the community, including members of Maquoit Bay Preservation Group — 40 or 50 property owners concerned about the greater implications of the lease. There is not enough information out there, they argue, to determine adequately the ecological effects of an operation this size, which would be the second-largest in Maine.
THE PLAN Niven and Devereaux have applied for a 10-year, 40-acre lease in Maquoit Bay in the area south of Bunganuc Rock and west of the Mere Point peninsula. If approved, this would expand their company’s size by about 160 times, if their quarter-acre estimates are accurate, and would produce more than 16 times the oysters they harvested in 2018.
The lease application was marked as “complete” by the Department of Marine Resources in February and details a 5-acre nursery for up to 2 million seed oysters, a 10-acre intermediate area for oysters in the early to middle stages of growth and 20 acres for the full-grown oysters and for sinking the cages during the winter. An additional 5-acre “experimental” area would be used for scallops and quahogs.
The space seems intimidating, but according to Niven, in the 3,000-acre bay, 40 acres covers only about 1 percent.
Devereaux said the operation would be spread out and wouldn’t cover all of that 40-acre plot. If the company consolidated all its gear into one corner of the leased area, it would take up about 1.5 acres. But with 250,000 oysters in the water right now, and with the goal of building that closer to 5 million, it needs more space. No matter what, it would take years to get to that size, he said.
While opponents of the project have expressed concerns that the operation would dominate the view of the bay, Niven argues that with more space, the visual impact may be a little less. The company plans to add more floating Oystergro bags, which he said are not only easier for the crew to flip than the cages, but also are less noticeable in the water.
The extra space also gives the company some flexibility for better management and sustainability if things need to be changed a little, Devereaux said, adding that calling it a factory is just a “scare tactic.”
The lease application also includes their current 10-by-12-foot barge and battery-powered oyster tumbler as well as one 20-by-20 barge with a shed and two 12-by-20 work floats for cleaning, sorting and repairing gear.
The business is family-run, with both Niven and Devereaux’s children helping out, and would add only a few part-time employees to help on the water but also would require the addition of a bookkeeper and possibly a contract scientist. They hope to recruit college and high school students to help with operations in the summer too, and to “keep the employment in Brunswick.”
“We are firm believers that this is the way to go,” Niven said of the expansion.
THE OPPOSITION Not everyone feels the same way. The Maquoit Bay Preservation Group was formed by a group of concerned citizens such as Mark Wyman and Paul Dioli who say they support aquaculture but are concerned Devereaux and Niven are biting off more than they can chew — and more than the bay can handle.
Early on, Dioli, Wyman and other residents received a letter from Niven and Deveraux, who is also the town harbormaster, introducing themselves and their small business, inviting them over for open house “office hours” and oyster tastings.
It all “seemed harmonious” and neighborly, Dioli said, until another neighbor found the 40-acre lease application. Until that point, they were under the impression that Devereaux and Niven were just continuing with their current aquaculture sites, which Dioli and Wyman say they fully supported. There was a blatant lack of transparency and the owners were “covert” about their plans, Dioli argued.
Niven and Devereaux claim the exact opposite — they were not hiding anything. The application had been online for months and they were willing to speak with anyone who had questions about their plans. In fact, according to Niven, he had tried to contact some of his neighbors to talk about their concerns, but they would not speak with him.
It’s is not just the lack of transparency that Dioli, Wyman and the others are upset about. The farm would be located in the middle of the deepest part of the bay, which is traversed by fishermen, kayakers and other boaters.
“This size and density has never been seen in Maine,” Dioli said, adding that he thinks this goes beyond a “not in my backyard” issue and could be dangerous for the health of the bay.
Concerned, Wyman wanted to become an intervener in the process and was directed to the harbormaster — Dan Devereaux. This, the group argues, is a conflict of interest, despite the fact that Devereaux recused himself from any comment on the application process. City officials have weighed in and determined there was not a conflict of interest, Devereaux said, but he understands how there could be “the appearance of one.” Wyman is not convinced that Devereaux should be responsible for monitoring his own operation.
Niven said he thought people were afraid of the unknown and, according to Dioli, that is exactly what they are afraid of.
“We need to study it,” he said. “Eelgrass is coming back. We support aquaculture, but this doesn’t fit. … Processing the oysters in the water is not best practice and adds unknown amounts of sediment to the water.”
When the boat launch was being proposed, he said, there was study after study and an application that was several inches thick.
“Whether you agreed with it or not, they were clear,” Dioli said. “This needs more investigation.”
Moving immediately for a 40-acre, 10-year lease was irresponsible, according to Dioli, who suggested they first could have applied for an experimental lease. This, according to the Department of Marine Resources, is “small in size (up to 4 acres) and short in duration (up to 3 years). … Experimental leases were created to allow for commercial and scientific research on sites before a longer or larger lease is needed.”
That move would have been met with plenty of “atta boys” and support, Dioli said. Instead, they opted for a decadelong lease that could “bring in $4 million per year and could easily be sold to a large corporation.”
“This doesn’t feel good,” he said.
The group is represented by Crystal Canney, of the Knight Canney Group, who has also served as a spokeswoman for politicians including Angus King, John Baldacci and Eliot Cutler.
“I only take work I believe in,” she said, “I care about the state of Maine.”
WHAT’S OYSTER FARMING? Devereaux and Niven have worked on 26 aquaculture sites in Maquoit Bay, taking up about a quarter-acre. They get their oyster “seedlings,” which are about the size of a pen tip, from Mook Seafood’s hatchery in Walpole. They can put up to 10,000 of those tiny seeds on a mesh screen, similar to a window screen, in the water and move them to bigger screens and bags with larger holes as the seedlings grow. Within a few weeks, the oyster seeds grow to about the size of a pencil eraser, but it takes about two years for an oyster to grow to market size. Throughout the growing process, the oysters are tumbled around in a drum to break off some of the sharp edges.
Once the oysters are ready for sale, they are tumbled again and washed on site. They are then taken to shore, where they’re stored in a walk-in cooler on Niven’s property until sale. Mere Point Oysters are popular at the Crystal Springs Farmers Market and in several local restaurants.
This year the company harvested about 60,000 oysters, Devereaux said, but next year it should have a much larger crop when the 250,000 oysters they started in 2017 are ready. According to their website, only about 40 percent of the oysters they grow are high enough in quality to be considered “Mere Point Oysters.”
Aquaculture, including oyster farming, has been heralded by advocates for its sustainability compared to other animal protein sources, such as cows and pigs. The average oyster will filter up to 50 gallons of water per day, decreasing turbidity and making the water cleaner, Niven said. Plus, according to Devereaux, harvesting 25,000 oysters is about the same as removing one household’s average annual nitrogen output.
“Oysters are restorative,” Niven said, adding that having lived there and watched how the bay has transformed over the years, “we have a unique and distinct interest in these waters.”
THE HEARING The Department of Marine Resources has scheduled a public hearing for 6 p.m. Thursday at Coffin Elementary School, 20 Barrows St., Brunswick. If the hearing “cannot be concluded by a reasonable hour” it will be continued Nov. 19 at the Crooker Theatre, Brunswick High School, 116 Maquoit Bay Road.
The DMR will evaluate the lease based on factors such as ingress and egress; interference with navigation, fishing and other uses; noise; and visual effects among others, although according to Dioli, their scope is too narrow. Each person wishing to speak must submit their comments in writing by 5 p.m. Wednesday.
DMR won’t make a final decision at the hearing.

Full text: Anyone watching the skies over Portland this past weekend may have noticed an unusual plane landing at Portland International Jetport.
Two V-22 Osprey aircraft touched down at Northeast Air, the executive terminal and maintenance center at the airport over the weekend.
The military aircraft built by Bell Boeing have tilt rotors that allow it to take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, but fly like a fixed-wing aircraft.
Stanley Jordan, who lives off Highland Avenue in South Portland, said he saw the two planes land at the jetport Friday and his wife spotted them again Monday morning near Pleasant Hill in Scarborough.
"They are very unusual. I was astonished to see them up in Maine," Jordan said.
The aircraft are used by the Marines, Navy and Air Force. Last year a Marine from Bethel was killed when an Osprey crashed into the ocean during a training mission off the coast of Australia.
Ospreys have flown into Portland before to refuel on their way to exercises or other missions, said Dexter Tatum, a line manager at Northeast Air.
The Marines don't regularly stop at the airport, but visits are not unusual, Tatum added.
"It was just a basic trip as far as I know," he said.
Osprey aircraft are no stranger in Maine. Ospreys from Marine Corps Air Station New River in Jacksonville, North Carolina, have refueled at Brunswick Executive Airport, the former Navy airfield, a number of times and three Ospreys flew low over Lewiston-Auburn in January. One of the aircraft also stopped in Stonington this May, according to a resident's Facebook post. Marines reportedly picked up lobster and shellfish during that trip.

Full text: Animal rights groups ask regulators to reduce threat of entanglement
Right whale defenders are now taking aim at aquaculture as they try to protect the highly endangered species from deadly fishing gear entanglements.
Advocates usually focus on the lobster industry, which is estimated to account for a million surface-to-seabed trap lines in East Coast waters, when talking about entanglement risks faced by the North Atlantic right whale, whose number has dwindled to fewer than 450. But animal rights groups asking for federal intervention to avoid extinction of the whales now are asking regulators to reduce the threat of aquaculture entanglement, too.
Researchers from Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a U.K.-based nonprofit that advocates for marine animals, want regulators to reduce surface-to-seabed lines in all Gulf of Maine fisheries, not just lobstering. They name aquaculture and gill net as rope-based fishing methods that are known to entrap, injure and kill both humpback and right whales. They say it's not fair for regulators, who are meeting next week, to seek rope reduction from lobstermen while issuing permits for other fisheries that use similar rope.
The proposal does not say how to implement this aquaculture reduction, or whether it should apply to in-shore, near-shore or offshore operations. Maine has a small but rapidly growing aquaculture industry, accounting for about a quarter of Maine's documented $6.5 million-a-year shellfish harvest; but consultants believe the value of Maine's farmed oysters, mussels and scallops will more than quadruple in value over 15 years.
A market analysis prepared for the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in 2016 predicts Maine's shellfish aquaculture industry will grow to $30 million by 2030. It has been cited in multiple economic development reports as having enormous potential for significant growth.
Leaders of Maine's aquaculture industry say they aren't aware of any interactions in Maine waters between aquaculture rope and right whales. Chris Davis, of the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center in Walpole, says Maine aquaculture is conducted almost exclusively in inshore waters, and thus is not likely to overlap with right whale habitat.
The Humane Society of the United States, Defenders of Wildlife and Center for Biological Diversity -- which filed suit against the federal government in January for failing to protect whales from fishing gear -- want to ban aquaculture operations year-round in any area that would be closed seasonally to protect whales, such as Cape Cod Bay, where right whales show up in large numbers to feed from February through mid-May.
These proposals are two of six submitted to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team, a group that helps write the federal government's plan to reduce the number of whale injuries and deaths, especially those caused by entanglement. The team will meet next week in Providence, Rhode Island, to review the proposals as it considers what changes it will make, if any, to its whale plan in response to the recent lawsuit.
The proposals under consideration also include several that would upend drastically the Maine lobster industry, which last year was credited with contributing $1.6 billion to Maine's economy. The proposals include seasonal closures in the western Gulf of Maine, a reduction in the number of lobster traps that can be fished and a two-year transition to a completely ropeless lobster fishery. Lobster industry groups say its gear has not contributed to the series of right whale deaths over the last two years that have left the population in such dire straits.

Full text: Discussion of proposed 40-acre lease in Maquoit Bay for farming avoided; preservation group opposes project
BRUNSWICK -- With the debate over a large-scale proposed oyster farm looming in the background, aquaculture experts pitched the benefits of oyster farming to Brunswick residents during a forum Thursday.
Though the event didn't address any specific aquaculture farms, the specter of an application for a 40-acre lease in Maquoit Bay off Mere Point loomed over the evening's presentations.
Mere Point Oyster Co., which proposed the operation, has downplayed concerns about the size of the farm.
Members of the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group, mostly residents of Mere Point who oppose the development, have been unswayed. Before Thursday's presentation, the group was handing out flyers calling the proposal a "floating factory."
But the presenters ignored dispute between the group and the company Thursday, opting instead to discuss the benefits of aquaculture in Maine generally.
"Aquaculture is a business. They're trying to make a profit," said Meridith White, director of research and development at Mook Sea Farm. "But they're also producing a sustainable protein source. Shellfish aquaculture is probably the most sustainable animal protein source available."
White went on to praise the oyster's natural ability to remove phytoplankton and nitrogen from the ocean.
"The oyster filtering phytoplankton out of the water is one of their greatest ecosystem services," she said. "One oyster can filter 50 gallons of water a day."
Chris Vonderweidt, of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, said that beyond positive environmental effects, oysters could be an economic boon for Maine. With lobster landings expected to decline in the coming years and groundfish landings already far lower than in the past, oyster aquaculture offers potential for growth. On top of that, there is a massive demand for Maine oysters, according to a market analysis the institute had done.
"The Maine oyster is the gold standard oyster in the U.S. marketplace," said Vonderweidt. "It's the most expensive. It's considered the highest quality by chefs and restaurateurs. It's considered to be premium."
It's unclear whether the experts' views on oyster aquaculture will hold sway with opponents in the Maquoit Bay debate. According to the flyers distributed Thursday, the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group opposes any aquaculture project larger than 2 acres and calls for all processing to be done on land zoned for commercial business. At the moment, there seems to be little middle ground between the owners' desire for a larger, more condensed operation on the bay and the opposition of residents.
The likely clash between the two sides had been scheduled for an Oct. 18 public hearing held by the Department of Marine Resources. Following public opposition, however, the department has canceled that hearing and is rescheduling it for a location with a larger seating area. The department has not posted a new date for the public hearing.

Seaweed is not a weed. In fact, it's not even a plant. It is a multi-celled algae. And nobody explains the history and value of seaweed better than Susan Hand Shetterly in her new book, "Seaweed Chronicles."
As a natural science writer, Shetterly joins the excellent company of other Maine natural science writers like Bernd Heinrich and Hannah Holmes, telling the seaweed story in engaging, entertaining narrative. As a resident of Morgan Bay, east of Blue Hill, she studies seaweed -- its history and biology, natural habitat, wildlife sanctuary, commercial uses, and the challenges of properly managing the harvesting and conservation of this valuable natural resource.
Shetterly deftly combines the science of seaweed with its commercialization as a human food source and industrial product use, as well as a water and air purifier and as a potential future source for bio fuels. She points out that seaweed is rapidly becoming a global food source, harvested wild from the oceans or grown in aquaculture farms, especially in China, Chile, Norway, France, Indonesia, the Philippines and Maine.
There are thousands of species of seaweed, all requiring flowing water and sunlight to grow and thrive. Seaweed provides food and shelter to countless varieties of fish, shellfish, birds and ocean critters (Maine fishermen and environmentalists have long understood the value of seaweed to fisheries). And now, certain varieties are a human food source, as well as an important ingredient in such products as ice cream, pudding, cottage cheese, toothpaste, cosmetics, pet foods, farm fertilizers, shampoos and medicines like iodine and burn bandages.
She also tells of the men and women who research seaweed and its uses and of their dedicated efforts to make policy and manage this essential natural resource, to both properly utilize the resource and protect it from overharvesting and depletion.

ONE GOOD THING
By Patrick McGowan
Polar Bear & Company, 2018
248 pages, $17.95
ISBN 978-1-882190-81-2

Float plane pilot Mac McCabe knows all about revenge, whether served hot or cold. If somebody threatens, insults or just annoys Mac (all politicians and corporate wonks), watch out. He will make you pay. And when Roscoe King, an arrogant, rich fat-cat hedge-fund billionaire almost kills Mac in a near mid-air collision, Mac decides to get even.
"One Good Thing" is central Maine author Patrick McGowan's debut novel, about good people doing bad things for revenge and the chance to do one great good thing in their lives.
This is an ambitious story with a predictable and uneven plot as four amateurs try to pull off a complex kidnapping and monumental theft of $11 billion. The targets are two billionaires, King and William Price, heartless corporate thugs who close the local paper mill, destroying the local economy and the livelihoods of hundreds of people. Mac already hates King, and the paper mill closing is the last straw. He teams up with his now-unemployed brother-in-law and two others to teach the billionaires a lesson, beginning a criminal conspiracy that will involve computer hacking, kidnapping, theft, corrupt offshore bankers, violence, torture, terrorizing and a surprising willingness to kill.
This is like "Ocean's Eleven," minus seven and without George Clooney and the smooth elan of crooks who know what they're doing. Mac's gang trains, plans and rehearses, and their scheme comes off almost without a hitch. Almost. Unfortunately, they talk too much, make dumb mistakes and hook up with a ruthless Cayman Islands banker who is a real criminal.
Their dream is to use the $11 billion to set up a single-payer healthcare system for New England (that's McGowan's dream, too); however, the conclusion leaves too many unanswered questions, like where did the money really go?
Bill Bushnell lives and writes in Harpswell.

Full text: Energy Pathway for Maine advocates for clean-energy technologies in advance of November elections
A diverse group of 20 organizations on Wednesday released a set of guiding principles it says Maine should follow to take advantage of expanding clean-energy technologies, while protecting the environment and strengthening the economy.
The six principles are contained in a document called Energy Pathway for Maine. Advocates include businesses and interest groups such as Coastal Enterprises Inc., Reed & Reed, East Brown Cow Management, the Island Institute, the Maine Council of Churches and the Shellfish Growers Climate Coalition.
The groups say it's important to have a public dialogue about these ideas, as Mainers prepare to elect a new governor and Legislature.
"Maine businesses are ready to invest in clean energy, and we are ready to invest in them," said Elizabeth Rogers, chief communications officer for Coastal Enterprises.
The six principles are:
[bullet] Maine must act to benefit from significant energy transitions underway around the world.
[bullet] Maine's economy is tied to its environment, a connection that is part of our history and the opportunities ahead.
[bullet] Climate change is causing Maine people to experience significant disruptions in their daily lives and bottom line. They want practical ways to do their part to ensure a safe climate for Maine people today and in the future.
[bullet] Innovation and competitive markets offer the fundamental solutions to our energy challenges and take advantage of Maine's entrepreneurial and resourceful spirit.
[bullet] Maine needs a long-term energy plan that benefits all Mainers, rural and urban, and across income levels.
[bullet] Mainers are concerned about the cost of energy. Reducing energy costs is one of many important objectives for greater prosperity and quality of life in Maine.
But the group says Maine is challenged to achieve these goals.
Maine isn't keeping pace with the rapidly expanding market for clean energy, the group says, while many states have started to make a major energy transition.
That's leading to lost job opportunities for young people and contributing to the state's aging population.
At the same time, it says, Maine exports $5 billion per year from the state economy to buy oil and gas, while abundant local energy resources such as solar, wind, wood and water aren't used to their full potential.
"Maine has hundreds of renewable energy jobs today -- from installers and operators to construction contractors, environmental specialists, and other professionals," said Jeremy Payne, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association. "Growth in this sector will strengthen Maine's ability to attract and retain productive workers."
The Energy Pathway for Maine document will be mailed to all legislative and gubernatorial candidates, as well as other stakeholders.
A companion website, www.EnergyPathwayMaine.com, has been set up for additional businesses and organizations to sign on as supporters.

Full text: Regulators say Dubois Livestock and Excavating polluted stream, created odor
Environmental regulators intend to revoke the license of an Arundel composting company accused of producing noxious odors, polluting a local stream and obstructing state inspectors.
Maine Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Paul Mercer last month issued notice to Dubois Livestock and Excavating Inc., a farm and earthwork company on Irving Road, that the department intended to pull the company's three compost licenses.
The notice followed the department's attempts for over a year to get Dubois to fix more than two dozen environmental rule violations outlined in three separate notices issued to the company in 2017.
The state alleges that Dubois' flawed composting operation emitted foul smells across the neighborhood, produced compost that contained salmonella, leached polluted runoff into a nearby stream, and accepted fish sludge in violation of its permits.
The agency further alleges Dubois staff barred inspectors from entering its property and denied record requests.
Company President Randy Dubois rejected the state's allegations in a written statement Tuesday.
"Dubois Livestock responsibly produces ... environmentally-important compost materials that are highly regarded by our customers. We have repeatedly requested meetings with the DEP so that we may address any and all concerns the DEP may have and assure the DEP of our commitment to the environment," Dubois said. "For reasons we do not understand, the DEP has refused to meet."
Mercer, in his August notification, said his department's concerns are detailed in multiple violation notices.
The department's staff outlined issues during a meeting with Dubois and an attorney last year, and the Dubois company provided a consultant report in July that has more evidence of runoff problems but "contains no detailed information for the Department to consider, and completely ignores the numerous other outstanding violations outlined in the previous (violation notices)," Mercer said.
Dubois has requested a public hearing on its license revocation. Parties that want to intervene in the case have until Oct. 5 to submit petitions to the department. A hearing date has not been set.
The company "will present the facts at a public hearing instead," Randy Dubois said. "We are confident those facts will demonstrate that our composting operation is carried out without damaging the environment. In fact, agricultural composting operations such as ours enhance the environment -- as well as enhancing the farms and gardens of southern Maine."
Dubois is permitted to receive up to 8,000 tons of residual waste, including fish and shellfish, and 21,000 tons of materials such as horse and cow manure, horse bedding and wood chips.
There are 24 Maine composting companies that accept food and fish waste and 21 that take sludge and biosolids, according to DEP spokesman David Madore.
The department has not revoked any composting licenses in the past 10 years, Madore said.
For years, the Dubois company has faced odor complaints from neighbors and repeated state environmental investigations as well as zoning challenges from the town of Arundel.
Dubois staff members in 2015 said the smell came from a mixture of compost and chicken manure spread on their fields.
The DEP, in a violation notice sent last June, said testing in 2015 and 2016 showed Dubois' compost was not processed at a high enough temperature, contributing to the noxious odors. A laboratory test in 2016 showed the company's compost had levels of salmonella bacteria above permitted limits.
All of those factors contributed to foul odors that wafted into nearby communities, a violation of a rule that compost operations must prevent nuisance odors at nearby occupied buildings.
The department was delayed from inspecting the facility because Dubois stopped its staff from going onto the property. The state got permanent access with an injunction order upheld by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court last December. In another site visit, Dubois employees refused to answer inspectors' questions.
In 2017, a spill of fish sludge in Kennbunk again drew regulators' attention to the Dubois operation. The company was charged by Kennbunk police for operating with an unsecured load that spilled onto Alfred Road. Department staff speculated about whether Dubois was accepting liquid waste in violation of its permit and asked to inspect future deliveries. Dubois denied the request, according to the June violation notice.
A second notice, in August 2017, charged that a faulty leachate system was disposing fluids into a nearby waterway, a tributary of Swan Pond Brook. Inspectors in May 2017 smelled a sulfurous odor and visible white fibrous growth in the discharge area and stream tributary indicating polluted discharge in the stream flowing north of Dubois' operation.
Dubois was cited again last October for nuisance odors after inspectors received 32 complaints about smell over the previous three months.
Department officials have demanded that Dubois stop distributing compost, stop leaching waste into nearby streams, turn records over to the department, and last August, halt all composting and develop a closure plan.
In his letter to Dubois this August, Mercer said only one of the seven corrective actions demanded by the department was "partially implemented." The DEP declined to say which action Mercer referred to.

Full text: Owners defend presence of new 40-acre project on Maquoit Bay, saying there won't be much visual, noise impact
BRUNSWICK -- Just three years after launching The Mere Point Oyster Company in Brunswick, owners Doug Niven and Dan Devereaux are looking to launch the state's second largest oyster farm, a 40-acre endeavor on Maquoit Bay.
For the owners, the expansion is the natural next step in their business's growth and part of an effort to consolidate several existing smaller leases in the area. But some neighbors fear the development will turn the bay into an industrial area.
"What is striking ... is the scale -- the magnitude -- of what's going on," said Paul Dioli, a member of the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group. "This is a factory going up on the water."
Mere Point has had smaller leases to harvest oysters on the bay for years, so when the company filed an application for another lease, many residents didn't really take notice, assuming the project would be similar to the farms that were already in place. It took a while before someone noticed the size of the proposal -- a 40-acre farm that could eventually produce 5 million oysters annually.
Paul Dioli and his wife, Kathie, were shocked when they learned what the proposal entailed. The couple have lived on the waterfront for nine years now, and they're used to the regular activity and noise of Maine's working waterfront, including aquaculture farms.
"We see lobster boats all the time, and we're huge proponents of aquaculture," she said.
"There's several great farms that have been in operation on that bay for years that have coexisted very nicely with the bay, with the neighborhood," added Paul Dioli. "It's never been an issue."
Still, they fear what this significantly larger operation could bring about.
"It's one thing to have a farm, but it's another thing to have an entire industry out on the water," said Kathie Dioli.
Niven and Devereaux say the idea that they're putting together a massive, industrial-scale project doesn't hold water. According to Devereaux, the 40-acre figure attached to the project can mislead casual observers as to the relative size of the farm.
"When people look out on the water, they don't necessarily interpret the amount of acreage that is there because you can see clearly," he said. "It's hard to get a perspective. ... We're asking for a relatively small portion of the bay."
The bay covers about 3,000 acres, said Devereaux, meaning their farm would span just over 1 percent of the area if maxed out. The Department of Marine Resources places the limit for aquaculture farms at 100 acres -- more than twice the area of the current proposal.
According to Maine Aquaculture Program Director Jon Lewis, the proposed farm would be large, but not unprecedented.
"Generally, our oyster farms around the state are 5-10 acres," said Lewis. "This would be a large one."
If it reaches the full 40-acres called for in the application, the farm would be second only to a 50-acre oyster farm in Trenton.
The company currently has 26 aquaculture leases in the area. If the department allows them to move forward with their proposal, those 26 leases will be consolidated and brought into the 40-acre area.
Residents have taken issue with several aspects of the project. Members of the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group showed up at last week's Brunswick Town Council to voice concerns with the proposal, notably the impact the project would have on the environment and on activity in the bay. Noise produced by an oyster tumbler -- a machine used to sort the oysters -- was also a concern, with Paul Dioli comparing it to having a cement mixer on the water.
According to a state site plan review, the farm is unlikely to impact most traffic around the bay, as larger vessels will stick to the deep channels on either side of the farm. Smaller boats, especially those traversing east to west across the bay, might have to alter their routes around the site. Brunswick Police Cmdr. Thomas Garrepy and Marine Patrol Officer Curtis LaBelle both said they believed the project would not hinder mariners.
The site review also indicated minimal if any impact on lobstermen, shellfish harvesters and bait fishermen.
The owners believe their farm will improve the water quality in the bay. Key to that claim is the fact that a single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water in a single day. Whereas most Mainers are concerned about what commercial activity is putting into the water, Niven and Devereaux are touting what their oysters are taking out of the water.
"It cleans the water. The water is less turbid, and you have more light penetration down to the eelgrass," explained Devereaux. "Our oysters are helping the bay. They're helping the vegetation of the bay. They're creating habitat."
As far as concerns over noise, Niven said that he built the oyster tumbler, and currently uses it out on the water at the company's several active leases. He said the noise produced doesn't even approach that of an idling lobster boat. The tumbler is powered by an electric, solar powered engine, further reducing noise.
Kathie Dioli says she felt blindsided by the scope of the project when she learned about it, and believes the owners should have been more proactive in reaching out to residents.
While the application process includes opportunities for public involvement, including a scoping session which was held on Sept. 11, many residents weren't yet aware of the scale. Some residents assumed that the lease would be for an aquaculture farm similarly sized to the ones existing in the bay.
"We had to start investigating on our own to find out what are these things? How do they develop? What happens with them?" she explained. "There was literally a complete lack of transparency by the principals."
On the other hand, the owners say they don't know what else they could have done to be more transparent. Documents for the project have been online for months, including a site plan that addresses some use and environmental concerns. The public scoping session, was advertised in the newspaper, but Devereaux and Niven said no one else showed up.
In addition to the public process, the two claim to have sent letters to all their Mere Point neighbors in July to let them know about the application. They've also opened up their facilities in the past to explain their business and the coming changes. "We were never hiding it," said Niven.
"These people just weren't paying attention," added Devereaux.
Devereaux serves as the harbormaster for Brunswick and is also listed as the town's marine warden. For the Diolis and others who spoke at Monday's Brunswick Town Council meeting, Devereaux's involvement with the project is an issue.
"Dan is an officer in the town, and people were really worried about voicing their opinions and having retaliation," said Kathie Dioli. "How's the town going to react when one of the principal owners works for the town?"
She did not elaborate on what type of retaliation she or her neighbors were concerned about, and Devereaux dismissed the idea that he would retaliate.
While Devereaux acknowledged that the situation could have the appearance of a conflict of interest, he has recused himself from any decisions related to the application process. And at last Monday's Brunswick Town Council meeting, Town Manager John Eldridge dismissed concerns over Devereaux's involvement, noting that the aquaculture application was overseen by the state, not the town.
For Niven and Devereaux, much of the concern with their project stems from misunderstandings about their application and company, as well as a lack of knowledge among the community about aquaculture in general. The owners invited to members of the Maquoit Preservation Group and any other concerned neighbors to come to an information session from 5-7 p.m. Thursday at Curtis Memorial Library.
Meridith White, director of research and development at Mook Sea Farm and other aquaculture experts will be holding a forum to address some common misconceptions about what aquaculture entails. Those who can't attend can watch online.
In addition, there will be a public hearing on the project at 6 p.m., Oct. 18 at Brunswick Town Hall. Written comments will be accepted until 5 p.m. the day before.

Full text: Wholesaler alleges embezzlement scheme from part owner
A lobster wholesaler is suing one of its part owners, alleging he embezzled nearly $1.5 million from the business.
Sea Salt, which operates as a wholesaler and a restaurant on U.S. Route 1 in Saco, alleges that the part owner, Matthew Bellerose, of Scarborough, set up a sham customer with another man and then sent the phony client thousands of dollars worth of lobsters without billing the customer. The lobsters were then resold, the suit says.
The suit, filed in York County Superior Court, alleges that $1,496,427 was embezzled from Sea Salt, but a footnote says the full amount of the loss still is being investigated and "is likely in excess of $2 (million)."
Another Maine lobster wholesaler lost money in an embezzlement scheme similar to the allegations against Bellerose. In January a former Massachusetts man pleaded guilty to shipping 50,000 pounds of lobster, worth about $360,000, to a customer in China. Jonathan F. Cowles' employer, Maine Coast Shellfish, was not paid for those lobsters. Cowles also pleaded guilty to federal charges of wire fraud for sending himself $25,000 in commissions to which he wasn't entitled.
A call to the York County District Attorney's Office inquiring about whether there is a criminal investigation into the Sea Salt case was not returned Wednesday. According to the Sea Salt suit, Bellerose started working for Sea Salt in 2009 and was offered a 20 percent stake in the business in 2017. At the time of the alleged embezzlement, the suit says, Bellerose was in charge of order fulfillment and shipping for Sea Salt's wholesale business.
The suit says that Bellerose and Vincent J. Mastropasqua, of Portland, who also is named as a defendant in the suit, set up a company called "East End Transport" and established a fictitious customer of Sea Salt named "Mastro's." Both businesses listed their addresses as a UPS store in Scarborough. Mastropasqua is a part-time UPS employee.
Normally, the suit says, a shipping label and an invoice for shipment of lobster from Sea Salt would be created at the same time, but Bellerose allegedly didn't create invoices for many of the shipments to Mastro's. The suit says the alleged embezzlement might have started as early as 2015.
"If no bill of lading or invoice was produced, then nobody would be the wiser if inventory was disappearing -- at least in the short term," the suit says.
Some of the lobsters sent to Mastro's were paid for by East End Transport, the suit says, but the company's other owners eventually noted that a significant amount of inventory was unaccounted for and brought in a forensic accountant to examine sales and shipping records. At that point, the lawsuit contends, the alleged embezzlement dropped off and the losses for May and June this year were a little more than $17,000.
Bellerose was fired at the end of June, the suit says, and the owners contend he admitted to embezzlement and offered to pay back the money. The suit says he blamed the expense of having to buy his 20 percent share of the company for the alleged embezzlement.
"Guys, I just want to say I'm really sorry," Bellerose texted his partners, according to the suit. "Not only have I betrayed your trust but years of friendship as well and that one will haunt me forever. ... I'd like to resolve this as best as I possibly can with you guys without my innocent family having to suffer for my bad decisions."
Bellerose declined to comment when contacted by phone Wednesday and hung up when a reporter asked questions about the allegations. His lawyer did not return a call seeking comment.
The suit charges conversion, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract and violation of Maine's deceptive trade practices laws and seeks damages of at least $1.4 million.
Gene Libby, Mastropasqua's lawyer, said his client and Bellerose set up East End Transport in 2012 with the idea of getting into the lobster shipping business. But the plans never materialized, Libby said.
Mastropasqua "had no knowledge and no involvement with Mr. Bellerose in the misappropriation of lobster from Matthew Bellerose's business," Libby said. "He (Mastropasqua) was not aware of Matthew Bellerose using East End Transport to ship lobsters and sell those lobsters." The "Mastro's" client, Libby said, was Mastropasqua's brother, a chef in New York who bought lobsters from Bellerose. Vincent Mastropasqua didn't know the Mastro's name was being used until this summer, Libby said.
Libby filed transcripts of text messages in court in which Bellerose allegedly tells Mastropasqua, "I feel terrible that you got dragged in." Mastropasqua replies, "You've got to tell them at that hearing that I had nothing to do with this," according to a transcript of the Aug. 9 text messages, and Bellerose replies, "Absolutely."
A transcript of a text message exchange between Bellerose and his wife, Amanda Bellerose, includes Amanda Bellerose referring to "innocent people involved, myself and Vinny."
"Vinny is losing his mind, rightfully so. Bad enough I married this mess," she texted, according to the transcript provided by Libby.
Lawyers for Sea Salt attached bank accounts linked to Bellerose and Mastropasqua in August. Judge John O'Neil Jr. held a hearing on motions by Mastropasqua and Amanda Bellerose to lift the attachments but has not ruled on those motions.
Sean McEwen, one of the partners in Sea Salt, declined to comment Wednesday, and his lawyer, Laura White, also declined to comment.

Full text: Knott revolutionized industry by creating more durable alternative to wood
James Knott, an inventor and entrepreneur who revolutionized the lobstering industry by building a better lobster trap, died Thursday at his home in Massachusetts. He was 88.
Knott was founder, owner and retired CEO of Riverdale Mills Corp., the company he formed in 1980 to produce wire mesh lobster traps, which Knott invented.
Riverdale Mills is the maker of "Aquamesh," the first marine-grade coated wire mesh used to replace traditional wood in the construction of lobster traps.
A trained economist and mechanical engineer, Knott had noticed how much time lobstermen spent fixing their wooden traps. He was convinced there had to be a better way.
Knott set out to build a more durable lobster trap to keep fishermen in their boats instead of on shore repairing traps or building new ones. He invented and began manufacturing Aquamesh traps, which lasted far longer and ultimately won over skeptical North Atlantic and Canadian lobstermen. Today, 85 percent of all lobster traps in North America are made with Aquamesh, according to Riverdale Mills.
In 2006, Knott was awarded an honorary doctorate degree by the University of Maine for his "commitment to the future of the lobster industry, innovative spirit, perseverance and positive leadership, willingness to share his knowledge and ideas and his outstanding support of UMaine's Lobster Institute."
"Jim Knott was a well-respected visionary and an ardent supporter of the lobster industry," said Bob Bayer, executive director of the UMaine Lobster Institute, in a statement. "His impact cannot be understated. The technical changes he introduced to lobster fishing in Maine and throughout North America were profoundly significant. He singlehandedly changed and bettered the way of life for so many people."
Knott founded Riverdale Mills in an old abandoned mill on the banks of the Blackstone River in Northbridge, Massachusetts. There, he worked with his sons to restore the facility and property, while beginning mass production of Aquamesh. An integral part of the science leading to Knott's innovative product were his proprietary galvanized after-welding and polyvinyl chloride coating processes.
This year, the company saw its raw price for steel double because of tariffs. In late July, the company had not passed on increased production costs to its customers in Maine. CEO James Knott Jr., son of James Sr., said Riverdale was absorbing the price hit by slowing the rate at which it was retiring construction debt and dipping into energy savings.
"We are who we are because of the lobster industry, so we're doing everything we can to make sure this won't hurt the industry," Knott said in an interview with the Press Herald.
Following the overwhelming success of Aquamesh in the lobster industry, Knott Sr. set out to expand and diversify the Riverdale Mills product line for other industrial, commercial and business applications.
His "WireWall" high security fencing, which is "virtually impossible to climb or cut," according to Riverdale Mills, has been installed worldwide at embassies, transit centers, ports, borders, military bases, manufacturing and power plants, and other highly secure locations. Knott's welded wire mesh is also used extensively by professionals in the horticulture, agriculture, aquaculture, construction and water treatment industries, the company said.
In all, Riverdale Mills now produces about 3,500 different wire mesh products, it said.
In his earlier life, Knott earned an economics degree from Harvard College, studied mechanical engineering at Northeastern University and served two years as a lieutenant in the Army. Before starting his own company, he was CEO of Coatings Engineering Corp., the world's largest custom plastic coater. He was also a longtime director of the Gilbert & Bennett Manufacturing Co. of Georgetown, Connecticut.
According to colleagues, Knott was an early adopter of recycling. To build some of his manufacturing machinery, he repurposed parts from a printing press the previous tenant of the mill had left behind. When asked once by a journalist how his company had thrived when so many other U.S. manufacturers had faltered, Knott responded, "We keep our costs low."
He also modernized the mill with efficiency in mind, restored the natural habitat, tapped the river for hydropower and instituted recycling of all the steel from the manufacturing process.
Knott was an ardent supporter of the lobster industry, funding scholarships and research.
"With the passing of Jim Knott, the lobster and shellfishing industry has lost one of its most prolific supporters," said Beth Casoni, executive director of the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, in a statement. "Jim believed in sustainable fishing and supported our efforts to ensure the viability of the industry and conservation of fish species. On behalf of the entire industry, we acknowledge his contributions, are grateful for his involvement, and will miss him tremendously."
Knott's death was preceded by that of Betty Knott, his wife of 67 years, who died in February. He is survived by his four children, Janet Knott, Andrew Knott, James Knott Jr. and Nancy Knott, and four grandchildren. James Knott Jr. became CEO of Riverdale Mills in 2015.
A celebration of James Knott's life will be held at the Whitin Lasell Manor at 120 Hill Street, Whitinsville, Massachusetts from 2 to 5 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 18. Condolences may be expressed to the family by visiting carrfuneralhome.com.

Full text: Small businesses in southern Maine are in line for federal grants to help them save energy and grow their companies.
Nearly $530,000 from the Renewable Energy for America Program and Value Added Producer grants will be allocated to six Maine businesses, according to a news release from U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who sits on the committee with oversight of the U.S. Department of Agriculture programs.
Turtle Rock Farm in Brunswick will receive $250,000 under the producer program. The money will be used to expand the marketing, preserving and canning of organic vegetables. The project is expected to increase revenue to the farm, grow the customer base, and increase the wholesale volume of Turtle Rock Farm.
Five businesses won grants through the renewable energy program. They are:
[bullet] T&D Wood Energy of Sanford: $200,000. The company intends to build a midsized wood pellet manufacturing facility, adjacent to an operating white pine sawmill. The project, which will use waste residue from the sawmill, is expected to generate enough electricity to power 15,142 homes.
[bullet] Mook Sea Farms, Walpole: $49,597. The grant will be used to buy and install a solar array for this oyster farm. The project is expected to save the company $14,238 per year in energy costs.
[bullet] Flying Frog of Freeport: $19,496. The commercial property company will use the grant to buy and install a solar array, which will benefit its tenant, Buck's Naked BBQ, by generating about 11 percent of its electricity.
[bullet] Mallory Property Holdings of Newcastle: $6,465. A real estate holding company, Mallory Property intends to use the grant money to buy and install a solar array at Split Rock Distillery, which it owns. The array will help the distillery save about $1,330 a year in energy costs.
[bullet] Porchside Properties of Dresden: $4,228. The company will use the money to install a solar array at Porchside Veterinary Care, saving the facility about $1,000 a year in electricity costs.

Full text: emoji as
their own
Lack of representation motivates UK group to launch petition
British transgender activists frustrated by a lack of online representation are claiming Maine's beloved new lobster emoji as their own.
The group, Lobsters Against Transphobia, launched an online petition last month to push Unicode, a nonprofit consortium that signs off on new pictograms, for a pink-and-blue flag emoji. Until they get their own flag, the group urged supporters to turn to the lobster, one of 157 new emojis that Unicode approved this year, as a substitute.
Lobsters can display both male and female characteristics.
"Emojis are a way for the world to connect and trans people shouldn't be left out of the conversation," the group said. "Unicode granted the lobster emoji proposal, which argued that people suffered 'frustration and confusion' at having to use a shrimp or crab emoji instead of a lobster. Imagine if that was your gender. Surely we deserve the same rights you have afforded crustaceans?"
Trans advocates are jumping on board the online campaign by adding the lobster emoji to their Twitter handles, dressing up as lobsters during Trans Pride parades and decorating colorfully polished fingernails with lobster stickers. On Twitter, they have gathered under the single banner of #ClawsOutForTrans.
As of Sunday, three weeks after it was posted, about 2,450 people had signed the petition hosted on change.org. But it has not gotten much attention in the land of lobster, at least not yet. No one at Equality Maine, the state's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organization, had heard of the campaign before being contacted by the Press Herald.
"I would be surprised if this caught on here," said executive director Matt Moonen. "It's basically already a symbol of our entire state."
The Mainer who kicked off the online lobster emoji campaign, Luke Holden, of Luke's Lobster, said he doesn't mind sharing.
"Lobster is for everyone," the Cape Elizabeth native said by email. "So until Unicode does right by the trans community, we fully support using the lobster emoji to advocate for their right to be represented."
The campaign is the brainchild of Charlie Craggs, a British author, activist and nail artist, but she is not the only one asking Unicode for a trans flag emoji. Another group of activists, including Washington, D.C., physician Ted Eytan and Georgia Navy veteran Monica Helms, who created the trans flag back in 1999, started asking Unicode for a trans flag emoji two years ago.
"I respect the frustration and creativity that has come together for #ClawsOutForTrans," Eytan said. "Successful social movements often have these elements. I am completely in support of their health, safety and enjoyment of life, made better through visible representation of their existence."
Unicode hasn't outright denied the trans flag symbol, Eytan said. Rather, in correspondence with him, Eytan said the consortium said it needs more information, such as proof that it is needed and that desire for the symbol isn't already covered by the gay pride flag emoji. But activists point out that many trans people, who represent about 0.5 percent of the U.S. population, are not gay.
But why the lobster? Why not the softball or the pirate flag that was added in the same class of new pictograms as the lobster?
Some trans advocates say it is a good example of transgender people being passed over for a much smaller but mainstream group -- 20 million trans people worldwide versus 1.3 Mainers -- but others like the idea of claiming the lobster as a symbol of trans pride because it can be a gynandromorph, or have both male and female characteristics.
According to Rick Wahle, a lobster biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, it is rare for lobsters to exhibit both female and male anatomy, but not impossible. It is a developmental anomaly that happens early in the embryonic development, he said. Its sex chromosomes do not divide properly, leading to divergent anatomy on different sides of the body.
Trans advocates call this biological fact -- one also be found in some birds, mollusks and fish -- a nice "twist of fate" for their mission.

Full text: Tasters: Nothing fishy
Expert trio detects no hint of lobster
The "Chopped" champion was skeptical. So was the Maine potato chip maker. And the food truck owner? She was "almost afraid" of what she would find inside the bag in front of her.
All three expert panelists cast a wary eye at the bag of Lay's New England Lobster Roll potato chips given to them for an informal tasting on Tuesday. The chips are one of eight new "regionally-inspired flavors" created by Lay's, the same folks who brought you the Southern Biscuits and Gravy chip a few years ago.
Sarah Sutton, owner of the Bite into Maine food truck that sells fresh lobster rolls by the sea at Fort Williams Park in Cape Elizabeth, perused the label on the packaging. "They actually have a New England Lobster Roll Seasoning," she said. She began reading off the ingredients: salt, skim milk, spices, maltodextrin, yeast, sour cream. "OK, the sour cream I like. Butter I like. Brown sugar I like."
Kelly Brodeur, owner of Vintage Maine Kitchen, a Freeport-based company that makes potato chips from Maine potatoes, poked her nose in the bag and noted the chips smelled like sour cream and onion chips.
Matt Ginn, the executive chef at Evo Kitchen & Bar in Portland who was a winner on the Food Network show "Chopped" last month and was the 2015 Maine Lobster Chef of the Year, said he was expecting the chips to taste something like a Japanese shrimp cracker made with dehydrated shrimp. But he observed that there appeared to be no animal products in the lobster roll chips. "No prawn, no anchovy, no nothing," he said. "It doesn't smell bad at all. I'm havin' at it."
With that, all three tasters dug in, crunching away in silence.
Their verdict: Where's the lobster?
"I'm getting no lobster at all," Ginn said. "This does not taste like a lobster roll."
The other two agreed.
"To me, it starts like it tastes like sour cream and onion, and then it finishes with something I can't explain," Sutton said.
"Like paprika," Ginn said, "or ..."
"Or toast," Brodeur chimed in.
The panelists -- thanks, perhaps, to Brodeur tasting hints of toast -- all eventually picked up on the flavor of a griddled, buttery roll in the chips. And they suspected the suggestion of paprika might be coming from a Lay's version of Old Bay-like seasoning -- perhaps the same seasoning used on the new Chesapeake Bay Crab Spice chips? The other Tastes of America flavors released regionally Monday by Lay's are Pimento Cheese (Southeast), Cajun Spice (Gulf Coast), Chile Con Queso (Southwest), Deep Dish Pizza (mid-America), Fried Pickles (Midwest) and Thai Sweet Chile (Pacific Northwest). Flavors from outside the region can be purchased online.
There was some discussion among the panelists about the possible reasons for the lack of real lobster flavor in the chips. Using lobster would be expensive, of course, but it also might be dangerous for people with shellfish allergies, they concluded.
Ginn, who was expecting a delivery of 20 lobsters at his restaurant that night, was nevertheless inspired. "If you give me two days," he said, "I'll make a lobster chip that actually tastes like lobster."
How? Roast the lobster "bones" on low overnight until fragrant and dehydrated. Then grind them into a fine powder. Add salt, sugar and preservatives, then fry up some potato chips and dust them with the powder. Voila -- real lobster-flavored potato chips.
And what would Ginn have done with these chips if they'd turned up as a mystery basket ingredient on his episode of "Chopped?"
"Maybe I'd crush them up," he said. "I guess we'd have to know what else is in the basket. If they gave me these and some lobster, or these and some fish, maybe I'd make some kind of panko dredge and use them to bread something, see if we could repurpose the texture on them a little bit."
Lay's will be promoting the New England Lobster Roll chips Thursday at the Maine Lobster Festival in Rockland. Hannah Hart, host of the Food Network Show "I Hart Food," will join Lynn Archer, owner of The Brass Compass Café and Archer's on the Pier, in a live cooking show at 3 p.m. They'll be preparing Archer's "King of Clubs," a lobster club sandwich that was once featured on "Throwdown with Bobby Flay."
Despite their disappointment that the lobster roll chips tasted more like sour cream and onion than seafood, everyone on our panel admitted that they've never met a potato chip they didn't like. And they figure anything that gets people talking about one of Maine's most valuable industries can't be all bad.
"Every time they talk about lobsters, lobster rolls and chips," Brodeur said, "it's good for everybody."

Full text: An estimated 1 million gallons of partially treated sewage spilled out of Portland's wastewater treatment plant and into Casco Bay on Thursday morning, washing away a section of the Eastern Prome Trail, closing East End Beach and raising questions about whether to hold the annual open-water swim from Peaks Island to Portland that is scheduled for Saturday.
The wastewater overflowed from a treatment tank and poured into the bay to the west of the beach and a boat launch. It already had gone through part of the treatment process in which solids are removed. This is the first time the plant has an experienced an overflow of this type, said Michelle Clements, spokeswoman for the Portland Water District, which operates the plant.
The water district reported the incident to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, which sent an inspector to the plant Thursday. A spokesman said the department could change the plant's operational plan or impose a monetary penalty in response to the spill.
"PWD will submit a full written report on the incident within five days and DEP will determine what actions may be appropriate based on the facts surrounding this event," the department said in a statement.
Clements said heavy rain that fell on Portland overnight contributed to the spill. The city's sewer system fills with stormwater during heavy rain, adding to the typical 20 million gallons flowing into the plant each day.
The wastewater came from a disinfection tank where chlorination and dechlorination occurs at the end of the treatment process, Clements said. One of the two chlorine-contact tanks was drained for cleaning Wednesday, but the valves to let wastewater back into the tank had not been reopened. The surge of water during the overnight storm overwhelmed the other tank and it began to overflow. Each tank can hold 400,000 gallons.
The water had been chlorinated, Clements said, but it did not sit for the required minimum 30 minutes in the contact tank, and the chlorine had not been removed yet as it normally would be before the effluent is released into Casco Bay.
"That contact time is important to get that full disinfection," Clements said.
Officials estimate the overflow occurred for less than an hour beginning at 6:45 a.m. A person on the Eastern Prom Trail reported the overflow to the city of Portland, which alerted the water district. Clements said she did not know why the plant staff did not realize the overflow was happening, and that question will be part of the investigation.
"We're just currently focused on getting restoration of the trail and getting information to everyone," Clements said. "After this initial phase, our staff will be detailing everything in a report about what happened."
Cathy Ramdsell, executive director of the Friends of Casco Bay, credited the water district with responding quickly to the spill. Still, it will be hard to quantify the damage done. Ramsdell said any remaining bacteria, pathogens or chlorine could be a risk to both people and marine life. The organization will be watching for any ramifications in nearby Back Cove, where algal blooms have happened in the past.
"This is an acute insult to the health of the bay," Ramsdell said. "We never like to see that."
Ramsdell said the Friends of Casco Bay works closely with the water district and appreciates the work they do at the East End plant.
"Accidents happen," she said. "We felt heartsick about this, both for them and the bay."
A spokeswoman for the Maine Department of Marine Resources said the area near the wastewater treatment plant in Portland already was prohibited for shellfish growing and harvesting, and there are no additional closures associated with the spill.
Maine Healthy Beaches conducts routine water quality testing at East End Beach and took a sample Thursday morning. The test takes 24 hours, so results will not be available until today. Meaghan Sims, the program coordinator from the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, said they are looking into their options to test the water today, as well. She declined to comment on the seriousness of the spill and referred other questions to the Maine DEP.
Clements said the sewage treatment plant was running normally Thursday, and there was no noticeable odor in the area several hours after the spill.
The water district is responsible for repairs to the Eastern Prom Trail, but it was unclear Thursday what the cost would be. The city said the popular walking, running and biking trail will reopen Wednesday. Until then, barricades have been placed around the damaged section.
A runner on the trail Thursday morning paused briefly at the barrier, swore and turned around. Nik Coggins, 26, stopped his bike at one of the barricades and peered beyond it. He was on a bike ride around the city and did not mind changing his route, but he was surprised to see the extent of the damage.
"It looks like Colorado, like a rock slide," Coggins said.
It was not immediately clear if the spill would affect Saturday's annual Peaks to Portland Swim to Benefit Kids, a significant fundraiser for the YMCA of Southern Maine. An expected 450 swimmers, who have raised about $180,000 for the local YMCA, are supposed to finish a 2.4-mile swim across Casco Bay at East End Beach.
"We're still assessing our options," said Meaghan Woodsome, the marketing director of the YMCA of Southern Maine. "We are still trying to gather information. We have a day or two to figure it out."
An email to participants Thursday said the organizers would make a final decision about the race today, when the results of water testing will be available.
"We are hopeful that the race will proceed as planned -- we know how important it is for our swimmers and want to see their training and hard work in action," the message from the YMCA states. "At the same time, we take the safety and health of all race participants very seriously and will make a decision based on this, in cooperation with our race partners."

Full text: to broadcast from Maine
Hey Mainers, on Tuesday, celebrity weatherman Al Roker will know exactly what's happening in your neck of the woods -- because it'll be his neck of the woods too.
Roker and a crew from NBC's "Today" show will film some of Tuesday's show from the midcoast town of Georgetown. It's part of a travel segment that will show Roker clamming, lobstering and camping in Maine. Roker said Thursday morning that he doesn't know all the details yet, and that's fine with him. He's a big believer in the energy and power of live television, and he thinks that's a big reason the "Today" show has been on the air since 1952.
"Yeah, we're doing this on the fly, which is great, and it's what people have come to expect from us. It's one of things I love about doing this," said Roker, 63. "I know there will be water and mollusks."
Roker has been a "Today" weather forecaster and anchor since 1996.
One of his signature phrases on the show, to introduce local weather forecasts at the end of the national one, is "here's what's happening in your neck of the woods."
Roker's Maine adventure is part of the "Today" show's "Great Outdoor Series." Roker and show co-anchor Craig Melvin will begin a New England trek Monday in Boston, broadcasting live and seeing sights, before hitting the road for Maine. Roker said he'll probably visit places along the Maine coast, though he's not sure which ones.
Roker and Melvin will pitch a tent at Sagadahoc Bay Campground in Georgetown, south of Bath. The campground is not far from Reid State Park and has views of Seguin Island Light. While in Georgetown, Roker said, he'll also do some clam digging and go out on a lobster boat for the TV segment, though he's not sure where.
Though Roker grew up in New York City, he has some shellfishing experience. He said his father use to take him crabbing off Rockaway Beach in Queens.
"I've dealt with crab traps, but not lobster traps. Usually when I deal with lobster, someone else has found it," Roker said.
When asked why Maine, and specifically Georgetown, was picked for the "Great Outdoor Series," Roker said that Maine is a place that comes quickly to mind when considering summer activities.
"It's summer. It's Maine. Why not?" Roker said.
Roker has been to Maine at least a couple times before. He has a specific memory of a family vacation at a campground near Kennebunk some 25 years ago.
"I had never seen horseflies that big. Those things had saddles on them," Roker said.
Besides hosting "Today," Roker has written several books. His latest, "Ruthless Tide," came out in June and is about the Johnstown Flood in Pennsylvania in 1889.
The "Today" show airs weekdays at 7 a.m. and can be seen locally on Portland's News Center Maine on Channel 6.

Full text: Researchers say highly aggressive invasive species migrating south from Canadian Maritimes to Maine
BIDDEFORD -- There's bad news on the horizon for coastal Maine regions already beset by green crabs: The destructive buggers could soon become, literally, even nastier.
In the world of green crabs -- the small but voracious invasive species threatening Maine's soft-shell clam industry -- ancestry apparently plays a big role in attitude.
For nearly two centuries, Maine has been home to a more docile variant of green crabs originally descended from southern European transplants. The cooler waters of Nova Scotia, meanwhile, are populated by more aggressive (and hardier) green crabs whose ancestors hitched a ride to the Canadian Maritimes from northern Europe a few decades ago.
Now, coastal currents are carrying larvae from those more aggressive -- as in, "offense is the best defense" aggressive -- green crabs from Nova Scotia to Maine.
University of New England professor Markus Frederich and his research team are trying to discern what, if anything, the latest invasion could mean to Maine ecosystems already struggling to cope with a population explosion of the more docile green crabs endemic in the state.
"At this point, we know they are coming, that they are highly aggressive and that they might cause problems," Frederich said. "No one will lose a toe (to a crab pinch), but it hurts. That is more of a nuisance. What really becomes (problematic) is if they are more successful in destroying soft-shell clams and destroying eelgrass."
Measuring anywhere from less than an inch to 3 or 4 inches across, the European green crab isn't always green, despite its name, but often has a mottled greenish or brownish color. The adaptable crabs can be found in mudflats, tidal marshes and even on rockier shorelines. Frederich said it is virtually impossible to tell apart the southern and northern European varieties at a glance.
Green crabs have already decimated soft-shell clam flats in areas of southern Maine, contributing to a nearly 40 percent drop in commercial clam landings in five years. In 2015, Maine's soft-shell clam harvest was valued at $22.8 million but had fallen to $12.4 million by last year.
Although present in Maine since the 1800s, green crabs are now a major predator of bottom-dwelling bivalves, mollusks and other small critters that are important cogs in the ecosystem and food chain.
Green crabs have also eradicated meadows of eelgrass that serve a critical ecological role by providing nurseries for many fish species as well as habitat for invertebrates and marine mammals.
With no natural predators in the U.S. or ways to control -- much less eradicate -- them, green crabs are expected to become even more numerous and disruptive if a changing climate continues to warm the waters of the Gulf of Maine.
"All of the research suggests that the only mitigation for green crabs is really adapting to their presence," said Chad Coffin, a clam harvester from Freeport who is president of the Maine Clammers Association. "They are dominating everything and there is nothing we can do about it except adapt to them."
Frederich said it is still unclear what an influx of more aggressive green crabs from the Canadian Maritimes could mean for Maine.
Northern European crabs are more cold-tolerant than their southern counterparts, so Frederich worries that hybrids could be both cold-water and warm-water tolerant. There is also the question of whether the Nova Scotian variety would be more destructive to eelgrass, although Coffin said the green crab variety endemic in Maine has taken care of much of the grass already.
But part of Frederich's research, he said, is to get a better understanding of why both varieties of crabs have been so successful in order to come up with ways to mitigate those successes.
His team put docile and aggressive green crabs through a series of tests to better understand the physiological and behavioral differences between the two varieties. In their lab located in a marine sciences building tucked into a corner of UNE's Biddeford campus, Frederich gauges crabs' defensive instincts by attempting to poke crabs in their mouth parts.
A video of several such interactions shows a Maine green crab desperately fleeing the approaching finger to the point that it actually crawls out of the research tub. A crab collected from Nova Scotia, meanwhile, immediately attacks the underwater camera even before a research team member could attempt to poke the feisty critter.
"The others (from Maine) would try to run away and hide, but the ones from Nova Scotia literally jumped out of the water at us," Frederich said.
In another experiment, Frederich's team placed green crabs on miniature underwater treadmills and tested whether changes in temperature, salinity or prolonged exposure to low-oxygen environments beforehand affected their endurance.
The result? Green crabs from Maine and Nova Scotia are exceptionally hardy, with one crab running at 50 percent of his maximum speed for two hours. That equaled a 1½-mile jog for a crab that measures just a few inches across.
"If they want to get somewhere, they will," he said.
Like Coffin, Frederich agrees there's only one answer to Maine's green crab problem: adaptation.
Last month in Portland, researchers, fishermen and chefs from New England and Canada gathered in Portland to explore the culinary potential of green crabs. The small crustaceans are considered a delicacy in parts of Europe, such as Venice, Italy, where they are a native part of the environment.
Yet Brian Beal, a University of Maine at Machias professor who has been studying green crabs and soft-shell clams for years, said Maine is never going to trap and eat its way out of the green crab invasion. That's because green crabs won't fetch the per-pound price needed to justify many fishermen investing in the gear needed to harvest them, thereby eliminating the likelihood of a large-scale, commercial fishery Maine.
Beal studies the overall impacts of green crabs -- particularly on the soft-shell clam population -- rather than the behavior or genetics of crab populations. The prospect of more aggressive crabs "doesn't bode well for soft-shell clams," Beal said, although he said a warming Gulf of Maine could be the biggest driver in crab behavior.
"All that I am seeing says that as seawater temperatures continue to warm, we are going to see higher rates of predation simply because these organisms' metabolism and their behavior changes with temperature," Beal said.
Coffin, the clam harvester, said he's seen his share of more aggressive green crabs although he had no knowledge of whether they were different varieties.
"There are aggressive green crabs here, for sure, and there have been for as long as I've been paying attention to them," Coffin said.
Coffin agrees that warming water temperatures -- and the resulting, longer active season for green crabs -- pose an intensifying threat to the clamming industry because it will mean fewer clams will grow to commercial size.
"The shellfish industry is in trouble down here," Coffin said.
Frederich hopes to publish a scientific paper on his research into more aggressive green crabs later this year. The research team will then continue examining whether these more aggressive crabs would be even more destructive to clams and eelgrass.
"We don't know that yet," he said.

Full text: Researchers: Heating ocean having impact on lobster, clam fisheries throughout Maine
AUGUSTA -- Two new scientific studies are highlighting the current and future impacts that rising ocean temperatures will have on lobster, clams and other important commercial fisheries in the Gulf of Maine.
Research of nearly 700 North American fish species predicts Atlantic cod habitat could shrink by as much as 90 percent by century's end and that lobster populations could shift 200 miles farther north as a result of climate change. Meanwhile, a separate research project suggests Maine's soft-shell clam industry could collapse unless steps are taken to protect the fishery from green crabs thriving in the state's warming waters.
"Something is out of whack and we need to do something about it. We need to adapt," said University of Maine professor Brian Beal, who has studied soft-shell clams for more than 30 years.
The studies are part of a growing body of scientific work seeking to understand -- and look beyond -- changes that fishermen across the country are witnessing on the water every day.
In the Gulf of Maine, which is among the fastest-warming bodies of water on the globe, cod and northern shrimp as well as other once-abundant species are experiencing long-term declines despite severe limits on fishing. Meanwhile, southerly species such as black sea bass and squid are edging into New England waters once considered too cold.
Research published this week in the journal PLOS ONE used data from more than 130,000 bottom trawls as well as 16 different climate models to estimate the current and future distribution of 686 fish and invertebrate species along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
The models used low and high emissions levels of climate-warming gases to calculate impacts, with the lower forecasts tied to levels set in the 2016 Paris Accord agreement. President Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from that agreement.
Overall, the research predicts hundreds of species will shift northward, further disrupting some of the nation's most important commercial fisheries. In Maine, some of Maine's most economically and culturally significant species -- including lobster, scallops, shrimp and groundfish -- could find the cooler waters to the north in Canada more hospitable if ocean temperatures continue to rise at the current pace.
The study led by researchers at Rutgers University predicted that:
[bullet] The remaining U.S. Atlantic cod habitat -- primarily off New England's coast -- could shrink by 90 percent by 2100.
[bullet] Lobster distribution could shift another 200 miles north, putting more of the crustaceans in Canadian waters and out of reach of Maine fishermen.
[bullet] Likewise, populations of Atlantic sea scallops that fetched Maine fishermen $9.3 million last year could shift more than 430 miles northward.
"It's quite striking how fast the Gulf of Maine is warming and is projected to warm in the future, so we do expect large impacts on the Gulf of Maine," said Malin Pinsky, an associate professor at Rutgers University's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Natural Resources and one of the lead authors of the study. "Some species are moving out but other species are moving in. And so, from a fisheries perspective, the question is can fisheries managers figure out that transition?"
Maine fishermen landed nearly $570 million worth of seafood last year, making commercial fishing one of the state's largest industries.
Maine's lobster landings fell 15 percent in 2017 to 110.8 million pounds worth an estimated $434 million. While not unexpected after a string of record-breaking years, some studies have raised concerns that lobster larvae are declining in numbers.
"It does suggest that the habitat will decline," Pinsky, a native of Machias and Orono, said of his group's study. "The question is will the habitat decline to a point where it cannot support a fishery?"
The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than nearly every other part of the world's oceans, according to studies by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and other organizations. A recent study by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that surface waters on the Gulf of Maine waters could warm by 6.7 degrees over the next 80 years, which is twice the warming rate witnessed over the past 30 years.
As waters warm, they become less hospitable to the cold-loving species such as cod and other groundfish that were the backbone of the coastal New England economy for hundreds of years. As in Pinsky's broader study, the NOAA research suggests the Gulf of Maine could experience sharp declines in groundfish abundance in the coming decades.
The temperature rise combined with other climatic changes also affects the abundance of important food sources, such as phytoplankton. A 2016 study by researchers at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, for instance, found that increased precipitation over the past 80 years and the resulting surge in freshwater has changed the color of the Gulf of Maine, making it more difficult for phytoplankton to compete for sunlight needed to survive.
Beal's research group at the University of Maine at Machias, meanwhile, says the changes have already had dramatic impacts on southern Maine's soft-shell clam population. And without an "introduction of some revolutionary thinking to the clam industry," Beal said, Maine may not have much of an industry left in the near future as one of the most voracious invasive species in Maine, the green crab, spreads and multiples in the warming waters.
In research conducted largely around Casco Bay over a four-year period, Beal compared clam survival rates inside special contraptions designed to keep out predators with clams located in the adjacent mud. And the results were striking: While they found hundreds or even thousands of clams ranging in size from one-eighth of an inch to 1½ inches inside the simple "boxes," just outside of the protected area there were practically none to be found.
"There are a variety of predators, so it's not just green crabs and milky ribbon worms," Beal said. "There are fish ... and birds that prey on clams, but I would say the most important predator that is preying on clams is the green crab."
A native of Europe, green crabs have been in Maine waters for roughly a century. But their numbers have exploded in the past decade, a trend that Beal and other researchers say is directly tied to warming waters. That's because the small crabs' predation rate and reproduction increase in higher temperatures.
Back when Beal first began conducting professional research in the mid-1980s, it was possible to get survival rates of 50 to 60 percent for young clams placed in unprotected areas. Now, they are seeing survival rates of 5 percent or less. In some areas of Casco Bay, less than 0.01 percent of juvenile clams survived beyond their first year, he said.
In 2017, Maine reported the smallest commercial clam harvest -- 6.9 million pounds worth $12.4 million -- since 1930. While part of that drop was due to harvesting closures because of harmful algal blooms, the number of licensed clammers in the state has fallen by roughly 75 percent since the mid-1970s.
"We are going to lose an iconic fishery, and we are going to lose it either because people don't care about it or they just don't believe" in the science, said Beal.
For his part, Beal said towns or individuals need to begin using some form of predator-exclusion devices, which he believes is likely workable on plots of 2 to 5 acres. Additionally, Beal said the state needs to protect the largest and most reproductively valuable clams from harvesting -- as is done in the lobster fishery -- while instituting "rolling closures" along the coast that protect clam flats during peak spawning times.
Acknowledging the politics of climate change, Beal said the reality is the Gulf of Maine is warming even if people want to debate the reasons why. He and other researchers would like to see water temperatures decline yet the current trend and the models suggest that is not likely. And that means green crabs will likely continue to flourish in the warming waters off Maine's coast.
"There is no predator that can even match the prowess of the green crab," Beal said, pointing out that the species thrives in all types of shoreline and eats almost anything but appears to have a special shine for shellfish. "They're here and no one is going to fish them out. So what we need to do is adapt to them."
Pinsky with Rutgers University said he hopes his group's study will "lay bare some of the choices ahead of us" as policymakers debate how aggressive to be in seeking to limit emissions of climate-warming gases.
"Sticking to the Paris agreement wold help our fisheries significantly," Pinsky said.

Full text: Grass-roots effort taps little-utilized statute to force action from officials
AUGUSTA -- Maine environmental regulators heard hours of testimony Tuesday on a citizen-initiated proposal that would require the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent annually while imposing new regulations on the trucking and biomass industries.
Tapping a little-used section of state law, a grass-roots group of attorneys and activists submitted nearly 700 petition signatures from registered voters calling for tougher standards on emissions of carbon dioxide and other climate-warming gases. As a result, the Department of Environmental Protection is required to begin rulemaking on a proposal that supporters -- including roughly a dozen middle and high school students -- contend is necessary to reduce emissions that threaten Maine's lobster and shellfish fisheries, seaside towns and public health.
"We know that this issue is real and that this is going to be one of the biggest issues that we face as a generation," said Ryan O'Leary, a Scarborough High School junior who was one of roughly a dozen students to speak Tuesday. "We are doing all that we can right now to combat it, but, at the same time, we realize that in order to truly preserve our beloved state for years to come ... we need bold support and direct action from the DEP."
Some business groups, however, decried the proposal as an unrealistic over-regulation that would make Maine even less competitive than other states.
"This whole concept is impossible to do and, if implemented, would shut down all large manufacturing in Maine," warned Jim Robbins, of Robbins Lumber Inc. in Searsport. "Those jobs would then be exported to China, which is the worst polluting country in the world."
The rulemaking petition filed with the DEP in January would set a new, statewide carbon dioxide emission limit of 17.55 million metric tons starting in 2021. Using that figure as a baseline, the proposal calls for the state to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 8 percent every year through 2035, thereby achieving a 75 percent to 80 percent reduction in emissions over 2003 levels.
Additionally, the proposed rules would require businesses that emit 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually -- as well as trucking fleets that generate 5,000 tons of the gas annually -- to file plans detailing how they will reduce emissions by 8 percent each year. The rules also would impose limits on emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, an electrical insulator that is thousands of times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
A group of attorneys from 350 Maine, Our Children's Trust, Citizens Climate Lobby and the Conservation Law Foundation as well as a half-dozen or so other activists submitted the rulemaking petition in January after collecting 696 valid signatures from registered voters. One of those attorneys, Beth Fuller Valentine, of Gorham, said the petition builds on a first-in-the-nation law passed in 2003 that set short-term and long-term goals for reducing emissions in Maine.
"Maine met the short-term goal through 2010 and is on track to meet the goal through 2020," Valentine said. "But we are here today because Maine's efforts to date are simply not sufficient to meet the long-term goal, which directs Maine to reduce emissions 'sufficient to eliminate any dangerous threat to the climate.'"
However, attorneys for large manufacturers as well as the Maine Forest Products Council -- an industry trade group representing mills, forestland owners and logging truck operators -- said Maine already is helping lead the national efforts to reduce emissions of climate-warming gases. They pointed to the 2003 law as well as Maine's participation in the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the nation's first cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce emissions from fuel-burning power plants.
If the DEP were to approve the rules, opponents warned, it would place unmeetable expectations and regulatory burdens on manufacturers, biomass plants, and trucking companies, as well as some hospitals and colleges.
"It's not that we are opposed to reducing (greenhouse gas) emissions; instead, we are opposed to these proposals because they are simply impractical," said Lisa Gilbreath, an attorney representing unnamed large manufacturers in Maine. "We're not aware of any such requirements in other states. But we need to remain competitive, and these proposals would put Maine manufacturers at a big disadvantage."
Maine law allows residents to petition any department to commence rulemaking on a specific issue. Agencies have 60 days to initiate the rulemaking process after receiving a request from at least 150 registered voters. But the law does not necessarily require departments to adopt the rules, and the administration of outgoing Gov. Paul LePage -- a Republican who was elected eight years ago on a pledge to rollback environmental red tape -- is unlikely to go along with environmental regulations opposed by major segments of Maine's business industry.
Yet scientists and fishermen told DEP representatives Tuesday that Maine can longer afford to delay taking more decisive action on climate-warming emissions.
University of Maine soil scientist Ivan Fernandez said he had not studied the details of the proposed emissions standards, but agreed with the push to further reduce emissions levels. A faculty member with UMaine's Climate Change Institute, Fernandez said Maine farmers are experiencing more droughts, Lyme disease is spreading rapidly as the climate warms and fishermen are facing increasingly acidic waters as the oceans absorb more carbon dioxide from the air.
"If the only concern from rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were ocean acidification, we would still have a burgeoning global crisis with Maine on the front lines," Fernandez said.
Richard Nelson, a retired lobsterman from Friendship, said fishermen are seeing the effects of climate change on a daily basis. Fish that used to be plentiful off Maine's coast are moving farther north as the Gulf of Maine warms -- a trend that Nelson said threatens the viability of Maine's iconic lobster industry. Additionally, ocean acidification could affect the ability of lobster and other organisms to form shells.
"All evidence suggests that any measure that would reduce the fossil fuels along with CO2 emissions would also limit the detrimental effects of climate change and ocean acidification that threaten our industry," said Nelson, who served on a ocean acidification task force created by the Legislature.

Full text: After a three-year wait, the Maine Lobster Shack has opened at 425 Fore St. in Portland.
The fast-casual seafood restaurant, located next to Gelato Fiasco in the Old Port, has been in the works since 2015, when it applied for its first permit from the city. Since then, the space it's in -- a former women's clothing store -- has gone through extensive renovations. The 38-seat restaurant is owned by Michael Michalski of Yarmouth and Portola Valley, Calif.
This summer, additional outdoor seating will be available on the restaurant's private patio.
The Maine Lobster Shack menu includes chowder, lobster rolls, oysters, mussels and a variety of fried seafood. The restaurant's hours are 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.

ban plastic bags
It pains me every time I shop for groceries in the state's capital, Augusta, to see hundreds of plastic bags leaving the store destined eventually for landfill and our oceans, where they harm fish, whale, and mollusks, and pollute the water itself. Everyone knows about this by now. It pleases me to note shoppers who get it bringing their own bags to shop, but they are still a substantial minority.
Thirteen Maine communities have either banned plastic bags entirely or charge a 5-cent fee per bag: Bath, York, Freeport, Brunswick, Kennebunk, Saco, Belfast, Rockland, Portland, South Portland, Topsham, Cape Elizabeth and Falmouth. Boston also banned them. Either way these measures reduce plastic use and waste. What, I ask, is holding up the capital city of our state, which is supposed to be an exemplar, from doing the same?
Of the eight members of the Augusta City Council I contacted about this issue by email, only one replied: the mayor himself. The others apparently do not care. Mayor Dave Rollins told me he will bring up this issue at a council meeting.
If you feel strongly about banning plastic bags in Augusta, contact the Augusta City Council and let the mayor know you support his effort. We all need to do our bit to keep our planet as plastic free as possible for ourselves and for future generations who could inherit a terrible mess unless we act.

Full text: Company thinks future of exports will look different than speedy present
When shipping live lobster, faster is usually better. Most lobster exporters dream of finding the most direct flight into Spain or the quickest customs line into China.
But a company with roots in the Canadian fishery thinks the future of lobster exporting lies in going more slowly, not faster. Live Stor America wants lobster dealers to ditch the expensive airplane trips and use their irrigated, refrigerated crate and container system to ship their product, literally, to Europe and Asia. While it takes a lot longer, ocean transit using this system costs less than flying, and the amount of lobster that dies in transit is much lower, the company says.
"We think this is going to revolutionize the lobstering industry," said Allan Gillis, a partner in the storage, shipping and crate and container companies espousing the idea.
The idea has met with some skepticism from dealers who say the price volatility and fragile biology of exporting live lobster require speedy deliveries.
But Gillis believes the industry will come around when he brings the concept to Maine. Live Stor America is scouting for a location in southern Maine to build its first U.S. holding and distribution hub, where lobster bought from dealers in Maine would be stored in high-tech, remote monitored crates and containers until they are moved by forklifts onto trucks, train cars and cargo vessels bound for the U.S. West Coast, Europe and Asia.
The idea of shipping live lobster in tanks has been in the works for years, but never perfected, said Annie Tselikis, director of the Maine Lobster Dealers Association. French container shipping giant CMA CGM is trying to bring its version of a lobster container to market, with lobsters hand-loaded into horizontal tubes inside foam cases stacked in a container outfitted with an oxygenation and filtration system. Maersk, the largest container ship operator in the world, tried to develop a live seafood shipping container, too, even doing some test runs; but it appears to have abandoned the idea, selling off that insolvent division to creditors, documents show.
Gillis believes his technology will succeed where others have failed. Each of his containers holds almost five times as many lobsters as his competitors' containers, and far less water, which means customers will be paying to ship lobster instead of water. His containers require less direct handling of lobsters, which reduces the labor cost and stress to the lobster, he said. Chilled-out lobsters live longer and arrive healthier.
Gillis' system works like this: Lobsters are placed tail down in honeycomb-shaped plastic "girdles" inside crates that mimic the rocky burrows of the sea floor and prevent them from killing each other. The crates are stacked in irrigated, chilled shipping containers, with temperature, water level and oxygen engineered to keep lobsters docile. With the same container used for storage and shipping, the lobsters can be moved without being touched, which reduces stress, mortality and labor costs.
The system is designed so that lobsters stored in floor-level crates have exactly the same amount of oxygen, water flow and temperature as those at the top.
Gillis claims lower labor costs, the relatively cheap cost of shipping and lower mortality rates means he can ship a Canadian lobster to China for about $1 Canadian dollar a pound, or half the price of air freight. After converting to American currency, that is about the same amount, or $1.55 American dollars, that it costs local dealers to truck their lobster to Boston's Logan or New York City's LaGuardia and send them to China in the cargo hold of a commercial flight.
The other big benefit of shipping versus flying is lower mortality rates, Gillis said. Lobsters flown by plane are usually laid flat, one on top of the other, in crates packed up with ice to keep them cold, dormant and wet enough to survive the 24- to 48-hour trip from boat to plate. A Nova Scotia lobster is touched 30 times, on average, between the time it is caught and when it is cooked, Gillis said, with each touch adding to the lobster's stress. His shipping method requires just five touches.
He has yet to test his concept on the open ocean, but in road trials, with cargo containers full of lobsters on the backs of flatbed trucks headed to Texas and Florida, fewer than 1 percent of his lobsters had died after 53 days in transit. Air freight mortality rates range from 3 percent to 8 percent, depending on destination and season, according to Maine dealers interviewed for this story. Shipping trials to Europe will begin this summer.
The low mortality rate makes this storage and shipping method ideal for weak-shelled lobster such as Maine's new shells or those caught in Northumberland Strait, the warm stretch of sea sandwiched between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, which is where the crate designer fishes for lobster, Gillis said. It would allow dealers in Maine to store their product with Gillis until the price goes up.
In Maine, the bulk of the product stored and shipped probably would be lobster, which is the state's biggest export, but Gillis said they can use the same technology, storage facility and shipping methods for as many as 30 different species, including high-value Maine exports such as elvers and those that could grow their global market share, such as mussels, oysters and green crab.
Live Stor America plans to work with a local fisherman and lobster dealer to test a 3,500-pound holding system in Maine over the summer, Gillis said. Once the technology has been proved, the company plans to build a million-pound holding facility and distribution center in the Portland area, eventually hiring a half-dozen people to run that hub. He hopes to begin construction next year. Live Stor's Canadian counterpart already is building a 250,000-pound holding facility in Nova Scotia.
Even if the technology works as advertised, lobster dealers might not be quick to embrace the concept because of pricing, cash flow and insurance challenges.
In an industry such as lobster, where dock prices can change as often as two times a week, a dealer would have a hard time developing a pricing matrix for lobster that could hold for 30 days, which is how long it might take some shipments to reach Asia, said Scout Wuerthner, who manages the lobster sales division of Inland Seafood Corp., which has a facility in South Portland.
Even if both parties could agree on a price that would hold, or some range, neither would want to be the one to front the deal -- the seller wouldn't want to ship before getting paid and the buyer wouldn't want to pay for the product nine to 12 weeks in advance. That kind of extension of capital or credit just doesn't happen in the industry, said Brendan Ready, one of the founders of Ready Seafood, a live lobster shipper based in Portland.
While it may be slower than flying, the kind of ocean transit that the Live Stor network is bringing to market will not take as long as Maine dealers think it will, Gillis said. Transport from Maine to Shanghai using road, rail and sea container shipping from the U.S. West Coast can be done in less than 20 days, he said. Transport to England and Europe can be done in a week to two weeks, depending on the carrier used and the end destination, he said.
Dealers also worried about insurance. It's hard enough to insure frozen processed lobster, much less a live animal that will spend a month at sea in a box, they said.
"I don't think our customer base would be a fit for this, as prices change daily and it would be tough to convince a customer to pay a certain price and receive the lobsters nine to 12 weeks later considering prices could potentially drop," Ready said. "That being said, we shouldn't shoot down the idea. I just don't think it will fit the Maine lobster industry well, but it's exciting to see any new innovations that could maximize our resource for both customers and harvesters."
His brother, John Ready, put it this way after talking to Gillis this month: "Interesting idea, but it seemed a ways from commercialization."
Tangier Lobster, a fourth-generation live lobster exporter from Nova Scotia, has been waiting to test the CMA-designed container, called the Aquaviva, for a year, but the promised generator required to wire a test lobster container into the Tangier facility has yet to arrive. While he wants to give it a go, manager Stewart Lamont agrees that the live lobster shipping technology offered by Aquaviva is not yet workable for the lobster business model.
Lamont says Aquaviva would save him just 10 percent on shipping but take 45 days to get to Asia, as opposed to 36 hours by air.
"Why in the world would we ship by ocean unless the cost savings were incredible? That is the question that thus far we have not been able to get around," Lamont said. "CMA/CGM is terrific, but they have developed a business model without properly doing analysis for live lobster costing and without being able to carve out a profit. I think they assumed if (they) built it we would come. ... The container may perform admirably, but the business model is impossible."

Full text: The owner of a landmark bar and restaurant on Portland's waterfront will serve four months in jail and pay more than $1.3 million in restitution for failing to turn over most of her sales taxes to the state, and for not paying her personal and corporate Maine income taxes, over a period of seven years.
Cynthia Brown, of Portland, who owns and operates J's Oyster on Commercial Street, was sentenced Monday by Superior Court Justice Lance Walker to four years in prison with all but four months suspended, Maine Attorney General Janet Mills said in a statement Tuesday. Brown, 58, also was placed on three years' probation.
Brown, who has an 11-year-old grandson, will begin serving her sentence, most likely at the Cumberland County Jail, in two weeks.
Mills said that Brown owed Maine Revenue Services, the state tax agency, more than $1.3 million in restitution, and has repaid more than $829,000 since pleading guilty in January 2017. Brown is required, under terms of her probation, to repay the remaining $473,000.
"Maine citizens trust business owners to pay over the sales tax charged to their customers to Maine Revenue Services and to pay personal and corporate taxes on the income that they earn," said Mills, a Democratic candidate for governor. "My office will pursue individuals who abuse the trust placed in them to collect sales tax for the benefit of the people of the State of Maine. We also will strive to recover as much restitution as possible in order to make Maine taxpayers whole."
Brown, beginning in March 2008, began failing to turn over most of the sales tax she collected from restaurant patrons to Maine Revenue Services. Mills said Brown "illegally kept" the remaining funds for her own personal and business use.
"Brown then underreported the restaurant's taxable sales and sales taxes collected, which enabled Brown to steal over $800,000 in sales tax," Mills said in the statement. "She also failed to pay personal and corporate income tax during this time period."
Mills said the practice of not paying sales and income taxes to the state eventually ended in March 2015.
Brown's attorney, Tom Hallett, of Portland, said his client's willingness and ability to repay restitution to the state earned her a reduced sentence. If she had gone to trial and lost her case, Brown might have received a longer sentence -- potentially in the range of seven to 15 months.
"You always hope for no jail time, but we weren't able to do that in this," Hallett said Tuesday. "In all honesty, this was a fairly lenient sentence."
Hallett said he remains hopeful that jail officials will grant Brown work release privileges. If that were to happen, Brown could work at her restaurant during most of the day, Hallett said. She won't be eligible for work release until about one month into her sentence.
In a telephone interview Tuesday evening, Brown was asked if she had any regrets about what she did.
"Yes, 100 percent. I was in a dark place," she said. "It wasn't done with intent. I let things go drastically for a while and this is where I ended up."
During those years, Brown said, she devoted much of her time to caring for her sick husband, Lester Brown, and not enough time attending to her business affairs. He died in 2013 after a battle with cancer.
"My husband's death brought me out of my fog," Brown said.
Brown took it upon herself to repay her debts, an effort she credits her employees for helping her accomplish.
"The business has been doing so well, I've been able to pay a lot of the money back," Brown said.
J's Oyster was established in 1977. Brown took over the business in 1989 after the death of her mother, Janice Noyes.
The case was investigated by the Maine Revenue Services' Criminal Investigations Unit. Hallett, Brown's attorney, said that the matter involved only violations affecting state taxes. The Internal Revenue Service was not involved, Hallett said.

Full text: Portland wants to meet experts on pier project
SOUTH PORTLAND ï¿½ Local lobstermen and aquaculture operators have been invited to weigh in on the possible redevelopment of South Portlandï¿½s pier.
City officials said they see an economic opportunity at the Portland Street Pier, particularly in the field of farming shellfish like mussels and oysters. The Portland Press Herald reports a pier master plan concerning design and assessment is expected to be completed in June.
The Gulf of Maine Research Institute, which is working with South Portland on the project, said a meeting will be held March 19 with fishermen and aquaculture operators at their headquarters in Portland.
Maineï¿½s US senators join school safety push
PORTLAND ï¿½ Maineï¿½s two U.S. senators are joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers to introduce legislation designed to fund school security improvements.
Independent Sen. Angus King and Republican Sen. Susan Collins say they are supporting fellow senators who want to pass the Students, Teachers and Officers Preventing School Violence Act of 2018. The legislation would also boost early intervention and prevention programs designed to curb school violence.
Collins said the proposal would help communities pay for new training and reporting systems, as well as enhance school security infrastructure. She and King say the legislation would authorize the federal Department of Justice to make grants available for the purpose of training students, school staff and law enforcement workers to identify signs of violence and intervene to stop it.
Restaurants, hotels set revenue record
PORTLAND ï¿½ Maineï¿½s hotels and restaurants set a record for revenue last year, bringing in about $3.8 billion.
The Portland Press Herald reports that tax records show lodging revenue broke $1 billion for the first time in 2017 after rising 7 percent from the year before. Restaurant revenue rose 4 percent to about $2.8 billion.
Compiled from wire reports Overall, hospitality industry revenue grew about 4.7 percent, coming down from a 10-year high of 7.2 percent in 2016.
The total number of tourists visiting the state in 2017 has not been released, but a Portland-based research firm estimates the crucial summer season saw about 1 million more visitors than the year before.
Schools lengthen days after snow day closures
BETHEL ï¿½ A school district in Maine will lengthen the school day by an hour for the next month to make up for time lost because of snow days.
David Murphy, superintendent of the Bethel-area school district, said Thursday was his districtï¿½s ninth school day of the year. WGME-TV reported that his district includes four schools and to combat the large amount of snow days, Murphyï¿½s district will be extending school days by an hour for the next 25 days.
Murphy said the district will recoup five snow days by doing this, and students wonï¿½t have to still be in school by late June.
He said the district added an hour to 25 school days last year and the plan worked well.

Full text: President Donald Trump released a proposed budget for the next fiscal year Monday that, if enacted, would have serious consequences across Maine.
The sweeping plan again proposes to eliminate the programs that provide heating oil to low-income Mainers, legal aid to indigent citizens, and grants to towns and cities to rehabilitate housing, infrastructure, and services. It also would stop federal funding for Maine Public's television and radio outlets, the University of Maine's Sea Grant research program and the Wells Reserve at Laudholm, which again would face closure.
The White House sought to eliminate all of these programs last year, but ultimately was spurned by the Republican-controlled Congress and might be again this year. The cuts last year were opposed by Maine's entire congressional delegation.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat representing Maine's 1st Congressional District, said via email that Trump's proposal "spells disaster for rural states like Maine and demonstrates how out of touch his administration is with the needs of the country." Pingree, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, added, "I'll fight the Trump administration's proposal to eliminate so many programs critical to Maine."
Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, who represents the 2nd District, said in a statement that he was pleased the budget request strengthened national security and supported the armed forces but was opposed to many of the president's proposed program eliminations, including heating assistance, public broadcasting, Sea Grant and Wells.
"As I have said before, we must make sure we maintain support for programs and agencies that serve our families and communities and help protect our environment," Poliquin said. "As Congress begins its work in the coming months on the federal budget, I will continue to push for continued support for these and other programs and agencies that do good for Maine families."
U.S. Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said via email that the budget "contains a number of concerning provisions that would roll back programs important to Maine's economy while also adding to the deficit." He said he hoped Congressional appropriators "prioritize smart spending to stimulate the economy and support people in rural Maine and across the country."
Neither U.S. Sen. Susan Collins nor Gov. Paul LePage responded to requests for comment Monday.
The White House proposal, titled "Efficient, Effective, Accountable: An American Budget," includes steep increases in military spending and funds to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, while severely reducing funding for Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and other programs.
Trump seeks to end the $3.39 billion Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating assistance to about 45,000 Mainers. His budget document states "the program is no longer a necessity as states have adopted their own policies to protect constituents against energy concerns."
The cuts also include an end to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency's Sea Grant program, which in Maine has funded groundbreaking work on how to monitor juvenile lobster populations so researchers can better predict future health of the stock; assisted mussel, scallop and kelp farmers with research and methodological expertise; developed organic certification guidelines for sea vegetable growers; and helped monitor and contain bacteria and other marine pests that plague shellfish growers and harvesters.
Sea Grant researchers created the Fishermen's Forum, the industry's premier event, in 1976, and helped found the Portland Fish Exchange, the University of Maine's Lobster Institute - which researches issues of concern to the industry - and the removal of dams and restoration of fish habitat in the Penobscot River watershed.
The budget also would eliminate funding for the Wells Reserve at Laudholm, New Hampshire's Great Bay Estuarine Reserve, and 27 other National Estuarine Research Reserves across the country.
"We have great support in our communities and states nationwide and bipartisan support in Congress," Wells reserve director Paul Dest told the Press Herald via email. "We are hopeful this will prevail again with the federal FY 19 budget when it is eventually passed."
The budget would eliminate funding for the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which provides a wide range of funds for Maine cities and towns, claiming "evaluations have been unable to demonstrate program results" and that "state and local governments are better positioned to address local community and economic development needs." In Portland, the program has been slated to fund food pantries, homeless shelters, mental health services, case work, child care subsidies for low-income single parents, a jobs program for panhandlers, community based policing and other initiatives.
At the Department of the Interior, the $13 million fund that helps compensate local communities for lost tax revenue from land included in National Wildlife Refuges also will be closed because "refuges often generate tax revenue for their communities." Maine has 11 such reserves spread across the state, from the Moosehorn reserve near Calais to the Rachel Carson reserve in Wells and Aroostook reserve in Limestone.
The budget also would eliminate the $385 million Legal Services Corporation, a Nixon-era agency that provides funding for legal aid agencies that help the poor take grievances to court.
In Maine, the agency provides $1.4 million a year to Pine Tree Legal Assistance, which is about half of its annual budget for general legal services. The 50-year-old legal aid agency, which represents poor Mainers in 4,500 cases a year, exposed and ended debtor's prison in Maine in the 1970s and one of its volunteers exposed national "robo-signing" scandal among subprime mortgage lenders.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which gets $495 million annually and distributes most of that to local public broadcasters, also would be eliminated, depriving Maine's statewide public radio and television broadcaster, Maine Public, of about $1.7 million, or 14 percent of its annual budget.
The president also seeks to end the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, which makes nearly $3 million in awards to Maine artists and cultural institutions each year, including the Maine State Museum, the Maine Historical Society, and Maine Arts Commission.
In northern Maine, the Northern Border Regional Commission also would be eliminated. The $10 million federal-state partnership has provided funding for infrastructure, land preservation, workforce training, and public services in distressed communities in the "Northern Forest region" of Maine and three other states. The closure, the budget document explains, will help encourage "states and localities to partner with the private sector to develop locally tailored solutions to community problems."

Full text: I grew up in an almost totally Caucasian town in southeastern Massachusetts. To the best of my knowledge, during my childhood, the only exception to this vast "whiteness" was a single Asian family.
This could have made me a racist. Having never personally known any persons of color, I might have deemed myself superior. Why should I associate with anyone of a different skin color? I'd be way out of my comfort zone. I wouldn't bother to learn about other cultures. Why should I care?
Or maybe, because I never was taught as a child to hate African-Americans, Asians or Latinos, or witnessed others being hateful, I'd never learn to be a racist.
Thankfully, it proved to be the latter. Too bad I can't say the same thing about our president. Though he grew up in New York City, and has basically lived there his whole life, he has secluded himself in a micro-world of white privilege.
I have felt nauseous for the past week. Anyone who judges others based on the color of their skin or where they (or their ancestors) come from sinks as low as a human being can go. I know.
You see, though my town was homogeneous racially, we weren't ethnically. We were all hyphenated, and were well aware of the ethnic origins of our surnames. As a Portuguese-American, I was at the bottom of the hierarchy, because we were the most recent arrivals.
There were cruel slang terms for every ethnic group that arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries. I call ours "the P-word," an insulting variation of "Portuguese" that I refuse to use, here or anywhere else. I worked at KFC as a teen, a job my father helped me get because he sold Arnold bread rolls to the franchise. On July 3 of this particular year, the Portuguese-American KFC manager asked me what my family was planning to do for the holiday the next day.
"We have a clam boil," I said, "but I'm not crazy about clams."
"And what self-respecting (P-word) doesn't like shellfish?"
Well, what self-respecting Portuguese uses the P-word? I duly reported this to my father, who then proceeded to tell off the manager, which could have ended both my job and his contract
... but it didn't. I think the guy was sincerely embarrassed.
Dad was sensitive to the importance of language. He had spent his early years in the city of Fall River, Massachusetts. His mother was the daughter of Québecois immigrants; his father, Portuguese by way of Brazil. He had to choose sides in the playground and street fights. Was he French or Portuguese? His Brazilian Uncle Manual had taught him how to fight. He had a Portuguese surname. He made the logical choice.
My father took after Manual, with his swarthy skin and pugnacious attitude. In the early 1950s, Dad went out to California to have a look-see. He had asthma, and his doctor thought the climate might be good for him. There, some people thought he was Mexican -- and treated him with prejudice. This was far worse than the childish ethnic skirmishes of his youth, and Dad never forgot it.
So I grew up learning that bigotry is wrong. I didn't learn how to hate. I did not want to be judged on superficialities. And I refused to judge others in that way.
As a school librarian, I recently read a book called "Sofie's Role," by Amy Heath, to several classes of early elementary students. Sofie and her parents, as well as everyone who works at their bakery, are people of color. Their customers run the gamut of human skin tones. And here we were, in the capital of the whitest state in the union.
We discussed the book afterwards. There were many different kinds of pastries mentioned, some with foreign names. The author used expressive language. Someone in each class noted the scene in which Sofie looks out the front window and sees what she perceives as huge shapes (adults) anxious to get into the bakery to buy their Christmas Eve goodies.
Not one student noticed that all of the major characters were black. One child did mention this: "All the men who work there are wearing white, and the ladies are wearing yellow and white."
I looked back at the book. He was right.
Excellent work, young man. You should run for president some day.

Full text: Thursday's blizzard pushed tidal flooding to levels not seen in four decades, and it was the third-highest in Portland since weather officials started keeping track more than 100 years ago.
Flooded buildings and piers were reported all along the Maine coast, from Kennebunkport and Wells to as far east as Machias.
John Cannon, a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, said Thursday's high tide in Portland was 13.79 feet, only slightly below the 14.17 feet reported during the infamous Blizzard of 1978. The second-highest level, 13.98 feet, also happened in 1978. Cannon said sea levels already were high because of the near-full moon, and the storm surge only made things worse.
In Portland, there was flooding on piers near J's Oyster House, on Somerset Street near Whole Foods and on Marginal Way near Diamond Street, city spokeswoman Jessica Grondin said. City officials advised motorists to turn around rather than drive through standing water.
In Scarborough, high-tide flooding made travel difficult on U.S. Route 1 near the Scarborough Marsh, on Sawyer Street near the Cape Elizabeth line, and on a private road, said Deputy Chief Marla St. Pierre, of the Scarborough police.
Andy O'Brien, a writer and former state lawmaker, posted on Twitter a photo of flooding at Lincolnville Beach near Camden, and wrote, "Never seen anything like it in my 39 years living here."
Pictures posted on social media from nearby Port Clyde showed severe flooding at the town's commercial fishing pier. In Scarborough, the Clambake Restaurant on Pine Point was flooded.
So was the Hurricane Restaurant at Dock Square in Kennebunkport.
Luanne MacDonald, who owns the restaurant, said she had prepared for possible flooding Wednesday and hoped for the best.
When she arrived Thursday, there was significant water inside the restaurant.
"I had to call the Fire Department because the water was over the (electrical) outlets and (there was) some smoking and sparking," MacDonald said.
Only a few days ago, she said, she had to close the restaurant unexpectedly because of burst pipes.
"I had already made an insurance claim for that, and now I'll have to have him come back out," she said.
MacDonald didn't know how much damage had been done but expected she'd have to replace her heating and cooling system.
and possibly some kitchen equipment.
Many roads were closed or blocked off throughout coastal Maine. In some areas, police kept drivers from trying to cross flooded roads.
The biggest threat of flooding was at high tide, or around 11:30 a.m. in coastal York and Cumberland counties.
"The worst is behind us," Cannon said at mid-afternoon Thursday.
The next high tide will occur after midnight, but Cannon said he didn't expect that to have a major effect because floodwater will have largely receded by then.
In the short term, the flooding was expected to erode beaches and possibly damage some coastal infrastructure, Cannon said, although it was too early to assess how widespread damage might be.
"One concern is that this could leave us more vulnerable for the rest of the winter, particularly if another extreme storm hits," he said.
About a month before the highest tide on record in Maine, in February 1978, another major storm hit. Cannon said that storm significantly weakened some protective barriers along the coast, which made the February blizzard that much more catastrophic.
"That could certainly happen again," he said.
South of Maine, many areas were experiencing high water levels as well, including Boston and coastal New Hampshire. Video footage on Facebook from a Boston television station showed a giant dumpster floating down a side street.
The National Weather Service station in Boston reported Thursday afternoon that flooding there also was approaching levels last seen in the Blizzard of '78.
"Major impacts & evacuations currently ongoing along the East Coast of Massachusetts," the weather service posted on its Twitter page.

Lobsters come free for needy -- no catch

Full text: Lobsterman Noah Ames gives away crustaceans from back of pickup
THOMASTON -- No one would ever mistake Noah Ames for Santa Claus.
For one thing, the Matinicus lobsterman is rail-thin and lacks that signature bowl-full-of-jelly belly. He dresses in a sensible parka bundled up against a cold December wind, not a dashing red outfit pulled together with white trim, a black belt and boots. And Ames' vehicle of choice is a black pickup, not a sleigh, although one suspects that Santa has the edge in roof-landing ability.
Ames does most of his good works on Christmas Eve and, for dozens of midcoast families, he, like the jolly old elf, shows up once a year to give with no expectation, or desire, for anything in return.
And rather than toys, Ames gives away hundreds of crustaceans, doling them out in plastic bags from the back of the pickup rather than Santa's preferred down-the-chimney method of delivery.
Ames conducts his giveaway parked out in front of a friend's marine supply store on U.S. Route 1 in Thomaston.
A simple A-frame sign was plunked into the snow at the edge of the road Sunday: "FREE LOBSTERS TODAY for families truly in need."
One man who saw the sign late Sunday morning pulled in and cautiously walked up to the pickup truck.
"How many do you have to feed?" Ames asked.
"Me, my wife and four kids," said Freddy Ames (no relation), of Warren.
"Then you'll need a dozen," Noah Ames said, and started tossing the shellfish into a couple of bags, aided by his daughter, Nadia, 10.
He handed the bags to Freddy Ames, who said, "What a nice guy" as he turned and walked to his car with his own daughter in tow.
That's Noah Ames' approach: no other questions besides "how many?" No forms to fill out to demonstrate need. If you feel as though you need a hand this holiday, Ames is ready to extend a claw, or two. Plus the tail.
Ames' quest to give away the state's signature product started four years ago, when he felt his children could benefit from a demonstration that Christmas is more than making wish lists and tallying how the "gots" fared against the "wants" on Christmas morning.
So he set out with about a hundred pounds of lobster that he had hauled in on his boat, No Worries. Other lobstermen and dealers heard of his plan and pitched in totes of lobsters, too. After refusing all offers of money the first few years, last year he accepted donations for a local family with a young girl who has cancer. He continued that this year, as the girl is still battling the disease.
"I didn't count it, but it was quite a bit," he said of the money raised last year.
Rick Whitten said his employer, Atwood Lobster, of South Thomaston, is happy to help out with 100 pounds of the crustacean.
"It's more of a community thing," Whitten said, "and I've never seen anyone taking (undue) advantage of it."
Walter Davis, of Thomaston, said he has stopped in each year Ames has been giving away the lobsters. Davis said this year was particularly tough for him and his family, with a half-dozen relatives dying within a few months of one another.
Davis said he's particularly thankful that Ames supplied his holiday meal.
"We've had a lot of things on our minds," he said, "and Christmas dinner wasn't one of them."
On Sunday, it took Ames about an hour to give away 400 pounds of lobster. He provided 100 pounds, and the rest came from Atwood Lobster and three other lobstermen.
Ames said he knows what it's like to face hard times, from the normal boom-or-bust life of lobstering to sudden setbacks, such as the time a few months after he began the giveaway, when No Worries sank at its mooring while he was away. He managed to salvage the vessel and get back to lobstering.
But one senses that as much as he likes lobstering, the once-a-year giveaway is what keeps Ames going on those cold February mornings when he heads out to tend his traps. "Some people (who pick up lobsters) will have tears in their eyes and can't really get their arms around giving lobsters away," he said. "I want to give back to people who are struggling. It's kind of gotten bigger than me. It's a good thing -- and the kids are really into it now."

Full text: Republican elected mayor of Lewiston
LEWISTON ï¿½ Maine voters have elected Republican Shane Bouchard as the next mayor of Lewiston.
The unofficial tally Tuesday was 3,663 to 3,518, with Bouchard winning by 145 votes against Democrat Ben Chin. He will replace Mayor Bob Macdonald, who served three consecutive terms.
Bouchard overcame Chinï¿½s large lead, which had about 40 percent of the vote Nov. 7. The city held a runoff election between the two candidates after neither received a clear majority.
Bouchard told the Sun-Journal voters ï¿½realized the difference between campaign promises and actionable solutions.ï¿½
Voter turnout was lower than the previous election with the dayï¿½s weather including snow and freezing rain. Around 10,000 voted in November and 8,200 voted in the 2015 mayoral runoff.
NOAA wants to fund more fish farming
PORTLAND ï¿½ Federal marine regulators are making $450,000 available to try to foster more seafood farming on the East Coast.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said itï¿½s providing $450,000 to expand aquaculture operations and production off the eastern states. The agency said it wants to offset the U.S.ï¿½s $14 billion seafood trade deficit.
NOAA said itï¿½s looking to fund pilot projects for fish, shellfish, seaweed and other facets of the domestic aquaculture industry that it considers ï¿½newcomers.ï¿½ It also wants to help develop environmentally sustainable ocean farming.

LIMINGTON ï¿½ Police say a man suspected to be under the influence of drugs broke into a Maine home, only to encounter a 6-foot-2-inch, 330-pound corrections officer.
The Portland Press Herald reports the break-in occurred at a Limington home Tuesday afternoon.
York County police say the 35-year-old suspect told York County Jail employee Sean Wilson he was being pursued. Sheriff William King Jr. says he was sweating, bleeding from the mouth and appeared to be in ï¿½excited delirium.ï¿½
Wilson ordered him to lie on the floor. However, King says he instead began walking toward where Wilsonï¿½s two 4-year-old children were hiding.
Wilson wrestled him to the ground and held him there until officers arrived. He was taken to a hospital for observation.
King says the man ï¿½picked the wrong house to burglarize.ï¿½
Man convicted in violent home invasion
PROVIDENCE, R.I. ï¿½ A Rhode Island man has been convicted of fatally shooting another man and gnawing part of a womanï¿½s finger off during a violent home invasion.
Twenty-seven-year-old Dari Garcia was found guilty Tuesday of first-degree murder and other offenses in Providence.
Prosecutors say the Providence man killed 27-year-old Richard Catalano in North Providence in 2014. They say that during the struggle, he also bit off part of Catalanoï¿½s motherï¿½s finger and pistol-whipped his stepfather.
Prosecutors say Garcia was found barricaded inside a room with Catalanoï¿½s body, apparently having shot himself after being abandoned by his getaway driver. They say nobody else could have killed Catalano.
Garciaï¿½s attorney accused witnesses of tailoring their testimony to the prosecutionï¿½s case. He argued discrepancies in their stories could establish reasonable doubt.
NH eyes Rainy Day Fund for opioid crisis
CONCORD, N.H. ï¿½ New Hampshire Senate Democrats want to free up about $10 million to fight the stateï¿½s opioid crisis.
Senators on Wednesday announced legislation that would allow the governor or Legislature to declare a public health emergency and tap into 10 percent of the stateï¿½s Rainy Day Fund. They criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to combat the crisis and faulted state Republicans for not putting more money in a fund for alcohol and drug treatment services.
Republican Sen. Gary Daniels says lawmakers should analyze the effectiveness of the $36 million the state is currently spending on the problem before looking to the Rainy Day Fund.
President Donald Trump declared the crisis a national public health emergency, but didnï¿½t include additional federal money.
RI aims to double grads in computer science
PROVIDENCE, R.I. ï¿½ Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo says she wants to double the number of graduates with degrees in computer science in Rhode Island by 2025.
Raimondo spoke at a computer science summit Wednesday at the University of Rhode Island.
To double the number of graduates, Raimondo wants to grow computer science programs in schools, improve the quality of computer science educators and ensure computer science opportunities are equitable by closing participating gaps.
Raimondo says nine colleges in Rhode Island produced 817 graduates in the computer science field in 2017, while more than 1,300 computing jobs were open in the state.
She says projections show there will be 2,500 computing jobs available in Rhode Island by 2020.
Raimondo says students need computer science skills to compete for high-paid jobs in growing industries.
Defense bill contains money on water study
CONCORD, N.H. ï¿½ A $700 billion defense authorization bill signed into law by President Donald Trump includes an amendment by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen to fund a nationwide health study on the implications of PFOA and related chemicals in drinking water.
The nationwide study will be conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
Shaheen, a Democrat, said Tuesday the amendment is particularly important for families living in the Seacoast area, following the Air Forceï¿½s announcement in May that it wouldnï¿½t fund a health study of water contamination around Haven Well at the Pease International Tradeport.
The Air Force is designing a groundwater treatment system for the former military base.
Man charged in sex ring puts up $25M
GLASTONBURY, Conn. ï¿½ A Connecticut businessman charged in a sex trafficking ring has agreed to set aside $25 million to cover potential payouts resulting from civil lawsuits.
Bruce Bemer was arrested in March and charged with patronizing a trafficked person in connection with what authorities called a long-running human trafficking ring based in Danbury. Authorities say many victims were young people with mental illnesses.
Joel Faxon, an attorney for several purported victims, tells the Connecticut Post that the move ensures his clients will be financially protected as their lawsuits move forward.
The Hartford Courant reports that Bemer will also turn over all his financial data.
Bemerï¿½s attorney could not be reached for comment.
Bemer owns the New London-Waterford Speedbowl and Bemer Petroleum Corporation in Glastonbury.
Guatemalan man sentenced to 15 years in heroin conspiracy
BURLINGTON, Vt. ï¿½ A Guatemalan man has been sentenced in Vermont to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute heroin.
The U.S. attorneyï¿½s office said Wednesday that 35-year-old Diego Walther Anibal Mejia Paredes conspired with a South Londonderry, Vermont, resident to ship large quantities of heroin from Guatemala to various addresses in southeastern Vermont in 2015.
Prosecutors say customs officials discovered more than 41 kilograms of heroin in one shipment addressed to a restaurant in Manchester Center, Vermont.
Paredes has been in custody since his arrest in October 2015.
His co-defendant, Marco Antonio Lam Peralta, also pleaded guilty in August, but prosecutors say he has since filed a motion to withdraw his plea.
Teen stabbed near Massachusetts high school
LYNN, Mass. ï¿½ Police say a 16-year-old boy has been stabbed outside a Massachusetts high school and the suspect remains at large.
The boy was stabbed near the outdoor basketball courts behind Lynn English High School at about 8 p.m. Tuesday.
The victim was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston with a stab wound to the chest and is expected to survive.
The schoolï¿½s boysï¿½ basketball team was inside at the time, but itï¿½s unclear whether the victim has any affiliation with Lynn English.
Witnesses reported hearing arguing before the stabbing.
Lynn Police Lt. Dave Brown says it appears there was an altercation involving several youths who knew each other.
Sen. Warren gets second turn as comic book hero
BOSTON ï¿½ All comic book heroes need a sequel ï¿½ even U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
The Massachusetts Democrat was the focus last year of a 22-page comic titled ï¿½Female Force: Elizabeth Warrenï¿½ which told the story of Warrenï¿½s rise from Oklahoma schoolgirl to U.S. senator and champion of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.
Now the publisher TidalWave Comics is bringing out a sequel ï¿½ ï¿½Female Force: Elizabeth Warren (hash)2ï¿½ ï¿½ which chronicles the early days of Warrenï¿½s U.S. 2012 Senate campaign and her rise to power.
Instead of Batman battling the Joker, readers can follow along as Warren battles Congress to ease the burden of crushing student loan debt.
Past subjects of the ï¿½Female Forceï¿½ series include Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Condoleezza Rice, Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and Nancy Pelosi.
Labor panel rules against Harvard in student union dispute
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. ï¿½ A federal panel has ruled against Harvard University in a dispute over a 2016 election to decide if graduate students would form a union.
The National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday denied Harvardï¿½s appeal of an earlier decision that nullified the results of a 2016 election and called for a new vote.
Harvard officials did not immediately comment.
Results of the November 2016 election were voided by a regional labor panel that concluded Harvard published an incomplete list of students who were eligible to vote.
An initial count had found that students voted against unionizing, but 300 ballots were challenged and werenï¿½t counted.
The national boardï¿½s decision paves the way for a new vote.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union applauded the decision and said members are focused on organizing students.
Woman who grabbed Wintrich notes appears in court
ROCKVILLE, Conn. ï¿½ A Connecticut woman has made her first court appearance after being charged with attempting to steal the notes of right-wing commentator Lucian Wintrich during his appearance last month at the University of Connecticut.
Catherine Gregory, of Willimantic, is charged with attempted sixth-degree larceny and disorderly conduct after taking papers from a lectern as the Gateway Pundit writer prepared to give a speech titled ï¿½Itï¿½s OK To Be White.ï¿½
Wintrich was originally charged with breach of peace after grabbing Gregory in an attempt to retrieve the notes. Those charges were dropped this week.
Gregory did not enter a plea Wednesday and her case was continued to January 9. Outside the courthouse, Gregory thanked people for what she called ï¿½their support and solidarity in the struggle against racism and fascism.ï¿½
Police: Swastikas found carved into high school desk
ANDOVER, Mass. ï¿½ Massachusetts police say three swastikas were found carved into a desk inside a high school on the first day of Hanukkah.
Andover High School Principal Philip Conrad announced Tuesday that the school will be working with police, local faith leaders and the Anti-Defamation League of New England to denounce the hateful graffiti. The Eagle-Tribune reports this is not the first time the school has dealt with swastika graffiti, as there have been several incidents this year.
Police Lt. Edward Guy called the graffiti disturbing and unacceptable, noting that drawing swastikas is a hate crime.
Andover High officials contacted the Anti-Defamation League on Tuesday to discuss response strategies.

Full text: A rare late-season toxic algae bloom has closed most of the fertile shellfishing areas in Casco Bay, disrupting the region's wild-caught and farmed shellfish industry.
The Department of Marine Resources expanded the area of the harvesting ban Tuesday so that it now stretches from Portland Harbor to the west side of Harpswell. The closure was triggered when tests of shellfish flesh showed elevated levels of domoic acid, a naturally occurring toxin that can produce sickness and brain damage in humans.
The ban affects hundreds of acres of productive clam flats in Freeport and Brunswick and at least a dozen mussel and oyster farms in those towns and around Chebeague Island. There were about 179 licensed clammers in Casco Bay in 2016, but 45 were in Harpswell, which has not been as affected by the closures. The number of full-time clammers is much lower than the total number of licensees. Almost all people who are clamming at this time of year are full-time, not recreational or seasonal, fishermen.
The domoic acid is being produced by a large phytoplankton bloom that includes species of Pseudo-nitzschia, the same kind of single-cell organism that closed large sections of the Down East coast to harvesting and forced shellfish recalls in the past two years.
This is the first recorded bloom of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia in Casco Bay.
Certain Pseudo-nitzschia species produce domoic acid, which can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, resulting in nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, short-term memory loss and seizures. The only recorded case of domoic acid poisoning occurred in Prince Edward Island in 1987, when three people died and more than 100 became ill after eating tainted blue mussels.
Having a bloom in this part of Maine so late in the season surprised state monitors, said Kohl Kanwit, director of the department's public health bureau.
"We thought we were done. We haven't seen Pseudo-nitzschia blooms resurge like this. It is really late in the season," Kanwit said. A volunteer on Chebeague Island first detected high concentrations of phytoplankton on Sunday, indicating an algae bloom.
A precautionary closure in the area was enacted Monday, after low-levels of domoic acid were found in a shellfish sample taken from an aquaculture site in the middle of the bay. It was expanded Tuesday after testing showed sharply elevated levels of the toxin in Freeport shellfish. That sample had domoic acid levels of 17 parts per million, uncomfortably close to the 20 parts per million action level, above which federal law mandates closures and recalls, Kanwit said.
"All through Casco Bay there are visible detection levels," Kanwit said. "We caught it in time. It is one of those things. It can happen so fast."
The closure will remain in place until phytoplankton levels decline, Kanwit said. In reaction to recent unpredictable Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, the state revised its monitoring protocol to allow snap closures at the first sign of toxin levels.
Aquaculture owners still will be able to harvest and sell product as long as it is screened for toxins before it goes on the market, Kanwit said.
"There are always people who depend on this for their living. We try our best to carve out areas that aren't being impacted. Sometimes it is unavoidable to have larger closures."
Eric Horne, who works at least 15 acres of oyster farms in Freeport, periodically deals with temporary closures because of storm runoff, but he said a biotoxin closure is an unfamiliar challenge.
"Any interruption to the flow of product is problematic for sure," Horne said. "This is a busy time for people in the shellfish industry."
Some wild harvesters don't have the luxury of specific testing and will have to wait until the state lifts its harvesting ban.
In 2015, clammers in Freeport, Yarmouth, Brunswick and Harpswell pulled in 822,287 pounds of soft-shell clams worth $2.1 million, roughly 9 percent of the statewide harvest value. Last year, Maine's softshell clam harvest was worth $15.6 million, according to state records.
About a dozen Brunswick clammers were digging in Middle and Maquoit bays before the closure was put in place, said Dan Devereaux, the town's marine resources officer.
While it hurts to lose access to highly productive areas in the two bays, Brunswick clammers can still work flats on the New Meadows River on the east side of town, at least for the moment, Devereaux said.
"The closure could expand in another day. We don't know," he said.
"This is the stuff we are going to deal with now because the environment has changed."
Chad Coffin, a Freeport clammer, said this type of biotoxin is unfamiliar and the approximately dozen clammers in town don't know what to expect.
"I don't have anything to compare it to," Coffin said. Unlike the phytoplankton that causes regular red tide blooms in Maine during the spring and summer, cold water doesn't seem to bother Pseudo-nitzschia, Coffin said. The water in Freeport was 48 degrees Wednesday, he added.
"Obviously it is concerning that the water is this cold and this stuff is apparently thriving or at least moving to the level of concern for public health."

Full text: Democrat wants to investigate high rate within industry
Nine years ago, a young "wrinkler" drowned when he was swept away by the rising tide in Lubec Channel.
Kristopher Fergerson, 27, was picking periwinkles, a small edible snail, with a friend to make ends meet after losing his job as a carpenter. The medical examiner labeled his death an accident, but Mick Devin, a local state lawmaker and shellfish commissioner, blamed it on drugs. Toxicology results found morphine, Diazepam, and ethanol in Fergerson's blood, records show. The harvester stayed out too long because he needed money to buy drugs, Devin said.
"That was almost 10 years ago, and you'd hope things would have changed, but it's only gotten worse," Devin said. "His death has always stuck with me, but I know that it's still happening. Fishermen are still dying from drugs. Fishermen in my district are telling me that young guys are using drugs and going out to work on the water every day, and that's dangerous -- for them, for the people they fish with, and for our local fishing economy."
Devin wants the state legislature to create a task force to investigate the high rate of addiction among Maine's commercial fishermen. Last week, a bill that Devin wants to submit to create the task force got a green light from the Legislative Council, which must approve all bills for consideration during even-numbered years when Maine tries to limit legislative debate to emergency matters. The Council voted 6-4 in favor of considering the task force bill.
It was one of 99 bills submitted for council consideration last week, and one of only 30 deemed to have met the emergency threshold for consideration. The council also green-lighted bills to promote higher wages for families through education and training, address rising electricity delivery costs and improve oversight of how Department of Health and Human Services investigates abuse cases. In October, it also approved 63 legislator bills for consideration.
The task force bill, which Devin is still writing, likely will be assigned to the health and human services committee once the legislative session starts in January. But he already has talked to Commissioner Pat Keliher of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, which oversees Maine's $700 million fishing industry, about the need to find a way to measure the scope of the industry's addiction problem and find solutions to beating it.
For years, industry leaders and regulators ignored drug use in Maine's signature industry, but Keliher talked about the abuse with the Portland Press Herald this year for a series of stories on Maine's opioid epidemic, including one that focused on the lobster industry. He went on to talk about the issue publicly at the Fishermen's Forum in March, which is the biggest commercial fishing industry event in Maine.
"Addiction is a disease and it is a problem within this industry," he said. "I am certainly not making the statement that it is everybody in this industry, but it is a problem."
There is no way to compare heroin use among Maine fishermen with any other profession. The state doesn't keep its drug use or death statistics that way, and it will not identify the 376 drug overdose victims in 2016, including 313 who died of heroin or other opioids. According to the Maine Attorney General's Office, 185 Maine residents died from a drug overdose in the first six months of 2017.
Addiction takes an economic toll, too. Keliher said many suspended commercial fishing licenses involved people who broke fishing laws to buy drugs or hide their habits.
And drugs can make an already dangerous profession lethal.
Police believe lobsterman Christopher Hutchinson was using OxyContin, marijuana and alcohol when he decided to sail his boat into a storm in 2014. His two sternmen died when it sank. The Cushing man is charged with seaman's manslaughter in the deaths and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted when he goes to trial in February.
While Devin is aware of the Hutchinson case, he said he wants to help fishermen who have become dependent on drugs, not punish them. Two retired lobstermen drove home the point with Devin when they told him: "'Everyone knows it's happening, and Augusta needs to do something about it,'" Devin said. "So this is me, trying to do just that, trying to bring together the right people to make a difference."

Full text: Explanation for toxic algae bloom unclear
No one knows where an algae bloom that closed hundreds of miles of coastline to shellfish harvesting this fall came from. Or why the microscopic phytoplankton responsible for it suddenly became so bountiful in the Gulf of Maine. Or even why it produces toxins in the first place.
What is known is that a toxic bloom of pseudo-nitzschia, a common phytoplankton, caused a recall of 58,500 pounds of blue mussels in September -- only the second shellfish recall in Maine's modern history.
To prevent another recall, the state is drastically reassessing its shellfish monitoring practices.
"I'm frustrated we had another recall this year," said Kohl Kanwit, director of public health for the Maine Department of Marine Resources. A similar pseudo-nitzschia bloom in 2016 forced a recall and closed a third of the state's 3,500-mile coastline to harvesting.
"I was confident we were going to be ahead of it. We knew a lot more, we were quicker to react to it, but we weren't accounting for the fact that in less than a week toxins could go from barely detectable to over the (safety) limit."
Next year, even a hint of toxic pseudo-nitzschia in the water will trigger broad precautionary closures until the department knows shellfish are safe, an entirely new approach to biotoxin management, Kanwit said.
"Usually you have plenty of time," she said. "Now, going forward into next year, the minute we start to see toxins we will start to take action. We won't wait to see what the next week's scores are, we will close down flats."
On Wednesday, the state lifted a harvesting ban on a section of coastline east of Milbridge after toxin levels declined to safe levels. It was the last part of coast to reopen since elevated toxin levels were detected in Frenchman Bay almost two months ago.
No illnesses were reported as a result of the September blooms, but a precautionary harvesting ban on parts of the coast from Vinalhaven to Eastport -- an area with little commercial harvesting -- remains in place awaiting testing.
Maine has practiced a successful shellfish safety program for more than 50 years and the state has been held up as the gold standard for monitoring and responding to bacterial and biotoxin problems.
But Maine's biotoxin program is designed to forecast and respond to annual blooms of Alexandrium, commonly known as red tide. Red tide is fairly easy to predict and manage, Kanwit said. If there is a red tide bloom, it is guaranteed to carry saxitoxin, which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning. Red tide predictably blooms in spring and summer and creeps in gradually so monitors can manage it by testing sites on coastal headlands and closing off specific harvesting areas where the toxin exceeds safety limits.
Pseudo-nitzschia doesn't work like red tide. It blooms suddenly and can become extremely poisonous very quickly, even at a low concentration of cells. "They are becoming toxic at cell numbers that are so low, there is something missing here," said Quay Dortch, the coordinator of the harmful algae bloom program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "We don't know, that is what is so strange about Maine."
There are about 13 species of pseudo-nitzschia in the Gulf of Maine, said Mark Wells, a marine biology professor at University of Maine who has studied blooms of the algae on the West Coast. Some species produce toxins while others do not. The species are so closely related researchers need an electron microscope to tell the difference. And they are unpredictable.
"They can bloom at one time with no toxin whatsoever and bloom at another time and be extremely toxic," Wells said. The speed with which it becomes toxic is also alarming, he said.
"... what is happening now is that (monitors) have a really short timeline to make a decision between the time they notice it and when it becomes really toxic."
Toxic species produce domoic acid, which can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, resulting in nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, short-term memory loss and seizures. The only recorded case of domoic acid poisoning occurred in Prince Edward Island in 1987, when three people died and more than 100 became ill after eating tainted blue mussels.
The federal action limit for domoic acid is 20 parts per million. If shellfish exceed that level, state authorities have to stop harvesting and issue a recall for any tainted product.
During the height of the pseudo-nitzschia bloom in 2016, tests revealed mussels near Brooklin and clams near Machiasport had toxin levels more than six times over the health limit. Lobster tomalley tested near Milbridge had almost five times the limit, according to unqualified DMR testing data.
A request for 2017 testing data was not returned by the department.
The sudden toxic blooms have alarmed monitors and scientists, but explanations are in short supply and so is funding to get answers.
Changes in Maine waters may be driving new blooms, Wells said. The Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest-warming bodies of water on Earth, and observers have warned about the ecological changes driven by a warming planet.
"The concern is, we are seeing the start of a trend, it might not happen every year but it may happen more frequently than in the past," he said.
In 2015, a massive bloom of pseudo-nitzschia on the West Coast shut down shellfishing and the lucrative Dungeness crab fishing industry for months. That bloom was connected to a "warm blob" of ocean water pushed onshore, which favored the development of toxic species, Wells said.
"The concern is the warming of the surface waters in the Gulf of Maine might be doing the same thing, but I have to emphasize, we don't know," Wells added.
Researchers also don't fully understand how algae blooms produce toxins, or why, said Dortch, from NOAA. Nutrients, water conditions, sunlight and multiple other envinronmental factors can make a bloom toxic, or not. Some think pseudo-nitzschia may become toxic when it doesn't have enough silica to reproduce, Dortch said.
"I think that at this point we don't really know, it is not just the Gulf of Maine that has this problem," she said.
And it's not likely additional funding for research on harmful blooms will be forthcoming anytime soon. Dortch said funding has never been sufficient for all research proposals and a 2018 budget from the Trump administration eliminates bloom research funding though NOAA.
But while funding is scarce, a scenario where there is no money to study harmful algae blooms is unlikely, said Don Anderson, director of U.S. National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
Scientists have become better at predicting algae blooms, even as the problem is getting worse, in coastal water as well as freshwater lakes and reservoirs. Lake Erie is periodically contaminated by algae blooms and has threatened drinking water for 500,000 in Toledo, Ohio and sickened some people.
The upside of worsening blooms is that politicians and government agencies are taking the problem more seriously and considering support for additional research, Anderson said. Woods Hole is trying to fund a research project focused on pseudo-nitzschia and hopes discoveries will go beyond the science of toxic blooms and develop ways to predict blooms and avoid recalls, Anderson said.
"That is what it is very frustrating, the research that is needed is much more than 'let's get some money to find out why pseudo-nitzschia blooms or doesn't,' it needs to get the managers what they need to deal with it."

Full text: The news, in the spring of 2016, took Hancock County's worm and clam diggers by surprise.
For the first time since the park opened in 1916, Acadia National Park rangers had begun stopping diggers from working the mud abutting park property. A ranger forced a wormer to dump his catch -- a day's work -- in the mud, while clammers had been issued summons for violating park rules.
"It was kind of a shock to everybody," recalls local worm digger Jonathan Renwick, secretary of the Independent Maine Marine Worm Harvesters Association. "Everybody here supports the park -- it's a wonderful thing -- but we should be able to go to work the way we always have, and hopefully calmer heads will prevail and we'll be able to."
Meanwhile, town officials in the area already were alarmed after learning a universally popular expansion of the park on the Schoodic Peninsula was being accomplished without the approval of Congress, upending the provisions of a 1986 law delineating where the park could and could not expand.
Now the Acadia region awaits a congressional fix to these and other park-related issues that have developed in the 31 years since federal lawmakers last considered property issues in and around New England's only national park, from rules about how and where the park can expand to whether it should subsidize local trash collection.
Identical bills submitted in the Senate and House in February by Sen. Angus King and Rep. Bruce Poliquin that seek to resolve these issues have been stalled for months on Capitol Hill.
On Sept. 25, Poliquin, a member of the Republican majority, wrote the leaders of the House natural resources committee, imploring them to schedule a hearing as soon as possible. "This comprehensive, common sense bill addresses a number of time sensitive issues," Poliquin wrote. "Without this legislation moving forward, I fear that the uncertainty for the local communities and for the hardworking shellfish harvesters will create unnecessary stress and conflict within the Bar Harbor Region."
Poliquin declined to be interviewed, but his spokesman, Brendan Conley, said he had not yet received a response to his letter.
The bill would make legal the park's acquisition of the 1,441-acre Schoodic Woods parcel -- a coastal woodland with a campground and bike trails anonymously donated in 2015 -- while prohibiting it from making any future acquisitions that lie outside a boundary line established by Congress in 1986. It would also direct the park to permit harvesting of marine organisms within the park in accordance with state law and local ordinances and to give a consortium of Mount Desert Island town governments $350,000 to subsidize trash disposal.
The Department of the Interior, which oversees the National Park Service, and a local board of advisers to the park, the Acadia Advisory Commission, support the bill but are seeking amendments to each of these provisions.
In acquiring Schoodic Woods, federal authorities circumvented a 1986 boundary law that locals thought had represented a binding compromise between Acadia and surrounding municipalities, raising fears that it would set a precedent and allow the park to acquire land wherever it wished.
"In the 1970s, Acadia had no limits on what it could acquire, and it made towns worry about how they could plan for the future -- where to put a school or a landfill -- when they didn't know what the park would own in future," recalls Ben Emory, of Bar Harbor, who sits on the park advisory commission. "There's no question in the minds of everyone who was here at the time that the intent of the 1986 legislation was to set a permanent boundary, and that anything acquired beyond it would require the approval of Congress."
To most everyone's surprise, in acquiring Schoodic Woods in 2015 -- which lies outside the negotiated boundary -- Acadia invoked a 1929 law that the 1986 law had presumably replaced, a law that lets the Interior secretary accept donations with little restriction.
The park made the move on the recommendation of its attorneys, in this case the Department of the Interior's regional solicitor's office in Newton, Massachusetts. "The question was what legal authorities were available, and the interpretation and advice of the solicitors office was that the 1929 act was a viable authority to receive a donation of land," park spokesman John Kelly said, noting that Congress had not repealed this older law when it passed the 1986 act.
David MacDonald, president of Friends of Acadia, a nonprofit that advocates for the park, says he thinks it was done without ill intent. "I'm sure they looked at the range of options for accepting Schoodic Woods and probably determined that getting legislation through Congress would be a long road," he says. "Folks were so excited about the acquisition, people wanted to see the public benefits sooner rather than later."
"I think it was well-intentioned but underestimated the import people have for the boundary," he said.
The pending bill would approve the Schoodic Woods expansion but make clear that all further acquisitions must comport to the 1986 law, but the Interior Department and members of the local advisory board say it needs to be amended to allow for minor property adjustments and land swaps to resolve surveying problems that come up from time to time between the park and hundreds of abutting landowners.
"These are needed for the public, not the park," says Acadia spokeswoman Christie Anastasia. "Someone might have a survey done and discover that a corner of a building they built is on park land. Clearly we don't want to tell them to take down their building, so we want the ability to do a minor land exchange to clean up the problem. Without that, we'd have to go to Congress to do it."
Poliquin is opposed to making such a change, spokesman Conley said via email, as he "wants to ensure local residents' certainty regarding the boundaries of Acadia and not leave them subject to change without going through the proper processes, such as through legislation in Congress."
King's staff didn't know whether he had a position on this specific issue. Spokesman Jack Faherty said the senator is working with park officials on park land law "to work out an approach that would make sense for everyone."
The legislation would also allow marine harvesting in the intertidal zone adjacent to the park as governed by state law, but Maine authorities and the park don't agree on the issue.
Park authorities have said they regret the enforcement actions taken last year against clammers and wormers, which were decisions made by individual rangers that did not represent an official-mandated change in practice. The park ceased enforcement after harvesters objected, and clammers and wormers have since resumed their work unmolested, pending final resolution by Congress.
"We've been able to go right on harvesting like we did before," Renwick says. "The park has acted in good faith with us, and I don't have any complaints since we mounted our initial resistance. But we would probably complain rather loudly if things don't go the way they should."
The details are still up in the air. The Interior Department supports allowing traditional harvesting activities such as clamming, worming and periwinkle harvesting to take place using current hand-tool technology but objects to the wording of the bill, which it says would allow mechanical seaweed harvesting, aquaculture operations and other more disruptive activities.
"We have concerns about expanding the harvesting to other 'marine organisms' or to aquaculture activity," acting park service deputy director Robert Vogel said at a July 19 Senate hearing on the bill, arguing that its wording should exclude these activities. "The full range of organisms included in Maine's definition ... could include any species from plants and mollusks to birds fish and mammals" that live below the high-tide mark.
The state Department of Marine Resources says these are not legitimate concerns. Spokesman Jeff Nichols said via email that Maine law does not give his department authority over mammals or birds and clearly stipulates that aquaculture leases can be granted only with the written permission of adjacent coastal landowners -- in this case, the National Park Service. Maine courts, Nichols noted, have ruled that rockweed is the property of the neighboring landowner, so it also cannot be harvested without the park's permission.
"From the state's perspective, if the NPS's primary concern is with ensuring the long-term sustainability of marine resources and harvest, the state's management activities in this regard should be sufficient," Nicholas added.
But others support the park service's position that nontraditional harvesting be excluded from Acadia's intertidal areas.
"Friends of Acadia shares the park service's belief that broadening permitted uses to include seaweed harvests is a concern, and we think legislation should be tweaked to remove such activities that would be of concern," MacDonald says. "Since none of that is taking place there now, it wouldn't be taking things away from folks."
Emory says the park advisory commission -- which includes appointees by Gov. Paul LePage as well as the current and previous U.S. Interior secretaries -- agrees. "We have a wide range of viewpoints on the commission, but there is unanimity on supporting traditional harvesting and on opposing rockweed or mechanized forms of harvesting," he said.
Both Poliquin and King are potentially open to adopting more restrictive language on the harvesting issue, their spokesmen said, as the intent is to protect traditional uses.
Park advocates are also concerned about a provision in the draft legislation that would require Acadia to provide $350,000 to a coalition of Mount Desert Island towns to subsidize their waste disposal programs.
In the 1986 law, these funds were to support the creation of an islandwide transfer station that the towns have since decided not to build. Park authorities say it is inappropriate to divert the funds to existing trash disposal, especially since the park already pays the towns to dispose of its waste.
MacDonald, of Friends of Acadia, says that if the provision goes through it would cause significant budgetary problems for the park. "This would have to come out of the park's existing budget, which is razor thin," he says. "It would gut visitors' services, including hiring seasonal assistance, and the downside for surrounding communities would be significant."
The bills would also let the town of Tremont use a parcel of land -- which the park gave it on the condition that it build a now-unwanted school -- for other public purposes.
Nobody is certain when the bill might get a hearing in the House, let alone be scheduled for floor votes in both Congressional chambers. But park advisory commission chairwoman Jacqueline Johnston, of Gouldsboro, hopes there's not a long delay.
"The sooner it's taken care of, the better the community will feel about it," Johnston says. "The concept itself is fully supported by the community. It's just finding the means and methods to get there."

Full text: AUGUSTA -- With the fate of 90 percent state's locally raised beef, poultry and pork on the line, lawmakers scrambled Friday to reach a deal to fix a recently passed law that originally was meant to allow farmers to sell their goods directly to consumers at their farms.
But after a threat from the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture that could have shuttered five state-licensed slaughterhouses, as well as dozens of other meat-processing facilities including small poultry processors or custom meat cutters, the Legislature's Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee unanimously passed a bill that clarifies the state's food sovereignty law, which allows local governments to set regulations for face-to-face sales on the farm.
Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who signed the sovereignty bill into law earlier this year, called a special lawmaking session to fix the bill and protect the income of thousands of Maine farmers.
But Friday's committee vote also swept up dozens of other commodities beyond meat, making sure that any future concerns by the Food and Drug Administration, the other major federal entity that regulates food safety, would not become a problem for those who grow other types of produce that is processed into food ranging from wild blueberries to aquaculture products such as farmed-raised seaweed and shellfish.
The Legislature is expected to vote on the fix to the law when it comes in on Monday for the special session.
Without the change, the state risks losing its Maine Meat and Poultry Inspection Program on Nov. 1. The operation is sanctioned by the USDA, but is run by the state's Department of Agriculture, which provides daily no-cost inspections for the five slaughterhouses as well as intermittent inspections for more than 30 custom slaughterhouses, 51 small poultry producing facilities and 2,741 retailers, according to the program's manager, State Veterinarian Dr. Jennifer Eberly.
Eberly told the committee Friday that following the passage of the food sovereignty law, federal regulators put Maine on notice that if the state was unable to enforce laws and provisions of the federal Meat and Poultry Inspection Acts, it would lose its designated status and the state's inspection program would have to stop.
Eberly reminded the committee that the state's program was the result of farmers and businesses working together over the last 15 years to develop a system to address an unmet need to expand local slaughterhouse options.
Beyond Eberly, dozens of farmers, including those who raise cattle, hogs, goats and chickens, testified before the committee urging them to fix the law. Many said without the fix they risked losing thousands of dollars worth of product.
"Food sovereignty sounds great, but it comes with all these implications," said Melvin Williams, a Waldoboro farmer. "It's about food safety. I don't care how good of a farmer you are, if you don't have somebody looking over your shoulder, you are going to try to pull a fast one. It always happens. This is a temporary fix, but let's get it done."
Lawmakers on the committee said the threat for farms was immediate and real.
"I don't think the general public realized how dire this situation is," said Rep. Russell Black, R-Wilton. Black, who operates a farm, including raising cattle for beef, said lawmakers wanted to protect the rights of municipalities to set their own ordinances around farm sales, but didn't want to run afoul of a food-safety system that intertwines state and federal regulation, especially at the cost of farmers not being able to get their meat processed or to market. He echoed the concerns some had about ensuring a safe food system in Maine. Others pointed out that one bad outbreak of food poisoning from an unregulated farm could give an entire sector a black eye, even if most were following all the best practices for handling and processing food.
A number of witnesses argued state and federal laws regulating food were in place largely to protect consumers' health and safety.
The law being fixed by the bill approved by the committee Friday, "An Act to Recognize Local Control Regarding Food Systems," endorses the right of Maine communities to declare themselves "food sovereign," something 20 communities, including several on the Blue Hill Peninsula, already have done. Another 25 or so municipalities in Maine have similar ordinances under consideration.
In practical terms, it means consumers can buy directly from farmers and food producers in those communities who are operating outside of state and federal licensing. The legislation was intended by those who shaped it, including state Sen. Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, its sponsor, and state Rep. Craig Hickman, D-Winthrop, who has put forth numerous similar bills, as a means to encourage local food production and consumption.
And while all the committee members voted for the bill, some members said they were concerned the proposed law change may have gone a little too far in reeling back provisions of a hard-fought state law that had taken years to pass and was surprisingly supported by LePage.
"Although there is strong reason to think that the federal government's threats could do serious damage to our state and therefore needed something, I think what we ended up passing was a little bit more than what was needed," said Rep. Ralph Chapman, an independent from Brooksville.
In essence, the change, if approved by the full Legislature, would still allow face-to-face sales from farmers to consumers on their farms, but certain products, including meat and poultry, would first have to processed in a licensed slaughterhouse that meets the requirements of federal food safety laws. Other non-processed products such as raw fruits and vegetables, live animals or eggs are not subject to the change.

Full text: Ever since President Donald Trump announced he would review his predecessor's creation of national monuments, Mainers have been focused on the future of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in northern Maine.
But a second New England monument also fell under the review conducted by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, one scientists and conservationists say is essential for understanding the rapid changes going on in the Gulf of Maine and northeast Atlantic.
Zinke has recommended that the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument -- a 4,913-square-mile area of underwater canyons, thousand-year-old coral forests, and volcanic mountains on and beyond the southern edge of Georges Bank at the mouth of the Gulf of Maine -- be opened to commercial fishing, a move proponents say would defeat its purpose.
"With the removal of fishing restrictions, a lot of the benefits of having this undisturbed area go away," said Peter Auster, senior research scientist at the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut, who has explored and studied the area with submarines and remotely operated vehicles. "Undisturbed, the animals in these areas should be able to feed more, grow larger and become more fecund, potentially contributing more to the success of fisheries, even if they're ultimately captured outside the area."
The monument protects undersea canyons, including one deeper than the Grand Canyon, and a group of seamounts taller than Mount Washington, that lie in an area that is not intensively fished. The area is frequented by fin, sei and sperm whales, and is home to groves of fragile, 9-foot-tall coldwater corals. It's the only permanently protected reserve in the federal Atlantic waters and would be the largest entanglement-free area for marine mammals on the Eastern Seaboard. "The idea of opening up the monument to commercial fishing defeats the purpose of having it," said Zack Klyver, senior naturalist with the Bar Harbor Whale Watch Co. "You need a place where stresses are removed to really understand what the true impacts of things like climate change and ocean acidification are."
Zinke's recommendation, which was leaked to The Washington Post and published Sept. 17, was applauded by seafood interests, particularly in southern New England, who had opposed President Barack Obama's designation of the monument in 2016.
Eric Reid, of Rhode Island-based Seafreeze Ltd., a major supplier of frozen-at-sea seafood that operates a fleet of fishing vessels, said the monument was designated after "behind-closed-door campaigns led by large, multinational, environmental lobbying firms despite vocal opposition from local and federal officials, fisheries managers and the fishing industry." Zinke's recommendations, he said, "make us hopeful that we can recover the areas we have fished sustainably for decades."
The heads of eight of the nation's fisheries management councils -- the industry-led bodies that implement fisheries regulations in federal waters -- were already on record against the commercial fishing restrictions. In a May 16 letter to Zinke and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, they said the bans were potentially counterproductive because they "disrupted the ability of the Councils to manage fisheries throughout their range as required by (the federal fisheries act) and in an ecosystem-based manner."
Five fishing industry associations -- including the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, the Atlantic Offshore Lobstermen's Association and the Rhode Island Fishermen's Alliance -- have a pending suit against the federal government alleging presidents do not have the power to designate marine monuments because the Antiquities Act refers to "land" controlled by the federal government.
The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts monument doesn't qualify because it's submerged and is located more than 12 nautical miles from shore, inside the United States' Exclusive Economic Zone, but outside its territorial waters, said Jim Burling, vice president for litigation at the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, California, which is representing the fishing groups.
Burling said it's too early to tell whether Zinke's recommendation will satisfy the groups' concerns with the monument.
"The proof will be in the pudding," he said. "We talk about management changes today, but those could be changed back with the next administration. We think the time will have to come to determine the legality of these kinds of national monuments."
Peter Shelley, of the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental attorney who is watching the case closely, strongly disagrees. "Their arguments run against the phalanx of academic and legal opinion on the act," he said, adding that the federal government has controlled fishing activities in the area since 1976, and that other countries around the world have created marine reserves in their Exclusive Economic Zones.
"But the most distressing thing about the litigation are the preposterous claims of economic harm that have been made, particularly by the offshore lobster industry," Shelley added. "There's no evidence or data that suggest the impacts are going to be significant in any respect."
Recreational fishing, bird and whale watching are allowed in the reserve, and lobster and red crab fishermen have seven years to move their gear out of the area.
An economic impact analysis prepared in July by the Washington-based environmental consultancy TBD Economics predicted lobster fishermen would face at most minor losses: between a net $85,000 annual loss and a $10,000 annual gain, once potential spillover benefits of protected breeding populations within the monument were taken into account. The report said this represented about 0.015 percent of the fishery.
Red crab fishermen would face slightly greater net losses of between $34,000 and $188,000 a year, the study estimated.
Auster said scientists haven't thoroughly evaluated the monument's spillover effects, but that the most likely beneficiaries would be lobster, mackerel, squid and redfish stocks, as those species use the reserve in substantial numbers.
The monument was originally to include Cashes Ledge, an underwater mountain ridge 80 miles east of Kittery, but that component was dropped in the face of opposition from fishermen and even the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Shelley said it was in Maine's interest to have the seamounts and canyons area not be actively fished or lobstered on account of the rapid warming of the Gulf of Maine, which is expected to displace traditional commercial fish species and is making the seawater more acidic, compromising the ability of at least some shellfish to grow their shells.
"There needs to be at least one control area in the U.S. North Atlantic where there would be a reference site to help distinguish potential offshore impacts associated with climate change from those caused by fishing," he said. "If lobsters suddenly started to crash, is it because of harvesters or because of temperatures? Having places like this could help us to rule out some things."
But Paul Molyneaux, a fisheries development consultant from East Machias and author of "Doryman's Reflection," a personal account of the collapse of New England groundfishing, said some commercial fishing practices are compatible with the goals of the monument.
"It all depends on the scale and the gear," he said. "Commercial fishing takes in destructive gear types but also people making a living with a rod and reel. Some of them are probably able to take place that are going to be consistent with a healthy marine ecosystem."
Trump has been expected for several weeks to decide whether to adopt Zinke's recommendations. A spokesman for the Department of the Interior did not respond to requests for comment.

Full text: arah Wineburg graduated from College of the Atlantic in 2013 with a degree in human ecology -- as do all undergraduates at the Bar Harbor college -- and she still calls herself a human ecologist. But here are some other descriptors Wineburg has had in the last year: oyster farmer, seaweed harvester, Montessori school teacher, captain of a sailing lobster boat, sailing instructor, and program director for the educational programs on the schooner Harvey Gamage.
And then there is her most recent gig, working with Harvest Moon catering in Waldoboro.
She just turned 27. She's in love, with her boyfriend and with Maine, and with what she calls "a really beautiful life," one geared toward tackling the world's sustainability issues, rather than adding to them. But sometimes?
"Sometimes I wish I had a job somewhere that was really stable and where I knew how much money I was going to make," Wineburg said.
That is a refrain often heard throughout professional circles in Maine, a state crawling with people with necessary side gigs, whether they involve snow plowing in winter or picking up restaurant shifts in summer. But among Maine millennials working within the field of sustainability, quite often at nonprofits, it's a particularly common phenomenon. And sometimes it goes beyond the single side gig to three or four part-time jobs that together, pay the rent, the student loans and not much else.
"You really have to want to do this," said Sandy Gilbreath, who works 20 hours a week at Maine Food Strategy, an initiative to advance collaboration in Maine food systems. She's pursuing her passion for local food issues, but since May, when funding cuts meant going part time at Maine Food Strategy, she's also been working part time as a bartender at the Riverside Grill at the Portland Golf Course. She holds an undergraduate degree from the University of Southern Maine in environmental planning and policy and a masters from USM's Muskie School in Policy, Planning and Management.
She's devoted to improving Maine's food systems, from promoting connectivity between local foods and Mainers to cutting back on food waste. And so are many of her friends, which tends to mean they're putting in resumes for the same few job openings. In July, Gilbreath spoke at an event sponsored by Portland Global Shapers Hub, a leadership group initiative of the World Economic Forum, Attendees had come for a discussion about how to make it in Maine, and they shared in Gilbreath's dilemma; making the world more sustainable is not exactly economically sustainable on a personal level. "The theme for all the speakers was that everyone had a side hustle," Gilbreath said.
"Everyone is overqualified," she added. "We all do it for the mission."
The mission is to make a better, more sustainable world and there are many ways to do that. For Gilbreath, it's through food policy, for others it might be promoting clean energy, working in sustainable fisheries or agriculture, education, forestry or wildlife biology. None of these are get-rich-quick fields.
On a day in early summer, Wineburg led the way through the fields at the Great Salt Bay Farm & Heritage Center in Damariscotta. It was time to check on her fledgling oyster farm, something she does every week or every few weeks, depending on her busy work schedule.
"I have like six jobs," she said. "I love all of them, but..."
Most have something to do with being on the water and while she wishes this weren't the case, some of her gigs are tied to the tourism industry. She worries she's selling out her lifestyle. Like her summer gig hauling lobster traps from a sailboat, showing tourists how the old timers did it.
"Like my way of life is someone's quaint vacation," she said, "when in reality I can barely pay my taxes."
There's also the seasonal factor; tourists tend to depart after Labor Day and so do their dollars.
"I have no idea what I'm going to do this winter," she said later, as she flipped through oysters, checking for mortality (she'd only lost a few) and growth (good). This is less like a farm than a garden, actually, since it's not yet commercial; Wineburg is enrolled in a two-year oyster gardening program intended to introduce students to the aquaculture movement. She gets to eat a lot of oysters, and, a side bonus for a young woman whose friends are partnering off for weddings on a regular basis is that she can gift them with oysters.
The sailing trips she leads, or crews on, some from Rockland Harbor, some Down East with Sail Acadia, are touristy too, but they go into the fall, and she feels as though they are "meaningful" because she's introducing people to the beauty of Maine's coast and natural resources. "And hopefully getting them to think about conserving it."
Emma Burnett volunteers with Portland Global Shapers Hub and helped organize the making it in Maine event where Gilbreath spoke in July. Burnett is a native Mainer who returned to the state after working in San Francisco; she came back with digital credibility and is able to work in digital communications on a national level, remotely. She feels lucky she's not racing around for multiple gigs, working for nonprofits, like many of her friends. The Maine economy presents a particular challenge for those working in sustainability areas like food systems, Burnett said.
"We have a lot of young people who want to have meaningful work lives," Burnett said. "But there are so many problems with it, salary being just one. Basically only people with family wealth can support a life on those salaries."
By family wealth, Burnett doesn't mean Kennebunkport seaside mansion style money; she means a parental safety net, often associated with white privilege. She considers herself in that category.
"I have got parents who are from around here who can pay my cell phone bill for 10 years," she said. "I lived with them for six months when I moved back home. I can ask them if I need to put down a deposit on an apartment."
She's struck by the irony of a situation where nonprofits trying to do good are paying so little.
"You are trying to help communities grow their own food, and you are forcing a white person with inherited wealth into the position because they are the only person who can afford it," Burnett said.
There's steep competition for these nonprofit jobs too.
"If there is one job opening it is like, everyone knows about it," said Olivia Dooley, who has been piecing together an income in sustainability work in the last two years in Maine, including temping, grant writing for Wolfe's Neck Farm, a stint on the Mayor's Initiative for a Healthy and Sustainable Food System (now the Portland Food Council) and an AmeriCorps gig that placed her with the Good Shepherd Food Bank. "Everyone is like, 'Have you seen that? Have you applied for that?' So you end up competing against friends."
Dooley recently landed a full-time job as the Northeast field organizer for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, a job that will take her as far as New York but allows her to live in Maine. She's not from the state but after she finished her master's in public affairs at the University of Washington and her boyfriend finished medical school, he landed a residency at Maine Medical Center. She'd been in Maine two full years before getting this job. In the early days in Maine, when she compared the local listserv with the one she was still getting from Seattle, the prospects for local employment seemed bleak.
"Just the quantity of options on a daily email listserv... it was a stark contrast," Dooley said. "But at the same time, the quality of life in Maine is pretty hard to beat," she added.
Jay Friedlander, a professor at College of the Atlantic (COA), said young people interested in sustainability often end up participating in that gig economy in larger numbers than some of their peers, either because they're interested in entrepreneurship or simply aren't interested in corporate life. "People are looking for careers that bring together the professional and the personal," Friedlander said.
So how do Maine colleges help their students prepare for it? At COA, one way is by fostering them through a program Friedlander runs called the Hatchery, which allows students with a business idea to explore it, for credit and with mentorship, full time for a 10-week term. Entrepreneurial students can test drive their idea before they graduate, and even if they're bartending on the weekends while they start to make that idea a reality, they've got the comfort of a game (or business) plan.
"At a place like COA, you get a lot of students who are on the forefront of what is next," Friedlander said. "As a result of that, they are out there, and they are establishing whole new industries, which can often mean that you're putting it together."
At Unity College, where the motto is "America's environmental college," a team of three supplies career counseling, from internships to full-time jobs to graduate programs. "Even though we have only 700 students," said Melik Khoury, the president of Unity, slightly more than 90 percent of graduates are either headed to graduate school or have a job within six months of graduation. "We are very proud of our placement rate."
But he's just as proud of their values.
"We educate them to be environmental stewards, first and foremost," Khoury said. "Money is a secondary motivator for most of them. And what we are finding is that students are more interested in working in jobs that mean more to them. On average, they do make a little less than I would say students from some of the Ivy League schools that are not focused on the environment."
But surveys of Unity graduates point to strong job satisfaction, he said. Meaningful work is a choice.
Sandy Gilbreath, the bartender with the graduate degree who is working so hard to reshape Maine's food system, would agree. Sure, it's not always easy to spend weekend nights bartending when friends are kicking back and relaxing. She said she could go get a job "as a secretary at a law firm and it would be a stable 9 to 5 job." But it wouldn't be fixing the world, or at least, Maine's food systems.
"You really do have to want it," she said. "It is worth the hustle."

Rare, 'massive' bloom coincides with clam deaths
State authorities are warning shellfish harvesters and others of a "massive" algae bloom in Casco Bay that can create low-oxygen dead zones, potentially lethal to fish, shellfish, lobsters and other marine animals.
The full extent of the bloom is unclear, but the state's warning coincides with a sudden die-off of softshell clams in Brunswick. About 14 acres of productive clam flats in Maquoit Bay are almost completely denuded of adult clams, a loss of up to $250,000 to local harvesters, Brunswick Marine Resources Officer Dan Devereaux said in an interview Tuesday.
Mud in the area is dotted with clam holes filled with dead clams and black water that Devereaux believes is depleted of oxygen.
Despite the timing of the die-off, Devereaux is not convinced it is connected to the Casco Bay bloom. The affected area is limited, and only one type of shellfish appears to be affected.
"There are so many things it could be outside of an algae bloom," Devereaux said. "It is not affecting quahogs or razor clams, just softshell clams dying in their holes."
The Department of Marine Resources on Tuesday said it was monitoring an unusual bloom of Karenia mikimotoi, the first time a harmful bloom of this phytoplankton has occurred in Maine waters, as far as the state knows.
The bloom is not hazardous to humans, but is associated with fish deaths in Asia, Europe and Alaska.
Thick, brown-green clouds of algae were clearly visible off the docks of South Port Marine in South Portland on Tuesday afternoon, completely obscuring the harbor bottom.
Recent tests showed areas around the marina had some of the highest concentrations of phytoplankton, according to Kohl Kanwit, director of the public health division at the Department of Marine Resources.
State officials regularly monitor for other types of harmful algae blooms, such as red tide, that can contaminate shellfish and cause illness or death in humans. However, it doesn't have experience with this type of phytoplankton and is monitoring the situation closely.
"We are not able to predict if a low-oxygen event will occur or if the current levels of Karenia mikimotoi will have wide-scale negative impacts on shellfish, but we are very concerned about these possibilities," the department's public health division said Tuesday.
Maine's commercial fisheries were worth $721 million last year, and any threat to marine life could have serious consequences for the state's economy.
The department recommended seafood dealers who source storage water from affected areas come up with contingency plans to protect their product.
Matt Moretti, owner of Bangs Island Mussels in Portland, said he and lobstermen friends started seeing brown tinted water in parts of Casco Bay in the last few weeks and alerted the department.
So far, the bloom seems to be concentrated in the Fore River, Portland Harbor and parts of Harpswell, Moretti said. While he isn't worried the bloom will hurt his mussel farms near Chebeague Island and Falmouth, the scale of the bloom is unsettling.
"We have visually been seeing it, which is bad," Moretti said. "It is disturbing that it is here now. It has never been here before."
While the algae's toxicity is not fully understood, scientists think the die-offs are caused by a low-oxygen environment created by a combination of the bloom itself and a toxin carried by the phytoplankton, the department said. Shellfish such as mussels, clams and oysters, fin fish and crustaceans such as lobsters could be affected.
"I would say this is another unprecedented occurrence in New England," said Kate Hubbard, an expert on harmful algae blooms with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission who is assisting the Maine Department of Marine Resources as it monitors the bloom.
Single-celled phytoplankton exist naturally in the environment, but under the right conditions they can grow quickly. In the case of an intense bloom like the one in Casco Bay, millions and millions of cells are concentrated in one area. Respiration by those cells and decomposition after death depletes dissolved oxygen in the water and can create dead zones of low or no oxygen where other organisms cannot survive.
"Basically, it is all related to the biomass of the bloom," Hubbard said. "Some of the cell concentrations that DMR is observing are very, very high. You are able to see water discoloration."
Fish die-offs have been reported during blooms of Karenia mikimotoi in Hong Kong, Australia, Ireland, Japan, Korea and Alaska, among other areas.
Maine authorities are asking anyone who observes a die-off of marine organisms in the Casco Bay region to report it to the marine patrol.

Full text: 98% of recalled mussels recovered after potentially fatal biotoxin scare
Thousands of pounds of Maine mussels recalled because of concern about potential contamination from a marine biotoxin were distributed as far away as Georgia and Missouri before being recovered and destroyed.
Almost 58,500 pounds of mussels harvested near Mount Desert Island were subject to the recall, initiated last Friday, of which 38 pounds sold to retail establishments remain unaccounted for in Maine. Five Maine seafood dealers affected by the recall were able to recover 98 percent of the suspect mussels within three days, according to the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
The department called for a recall after testing found elevated levels of the neurotoxin domoic acid in mussels. Domoic acid is produced by a bloom of Pseudo-nitszchia, a phytoplankton found in Maine waters. The toxin may cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, which can make humans ill if ingested and, in extreme instances, cause paralysis or death.
In response to the harmful bloom, the department put a precautionary ban on about a third of Maine's coastline from Mount Desert Island to Calais. On Wednesday, the DMR reopened some harvesting areas after determining there was no biotoxin risk.
The recall was for mussels harvested in Frenchman Bay between Mount Desert Island and the mainland from Sept. 10 to 14 that were found to have elevated levels of domoic acid. Possibly contaminated mussels were distributed in 10 states: Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The vast majority of recalled mussels were sold to wholesale dealers and were not yet distributed to retail businesses, said DMR spokesman Jeff Nichols.
Approximately 38,905 pounds of mussels, about 66 percent of the total, were recovered in Maine, according to figures released by the department Wednesday. Only 240 pounds were sold to stores or restaurants and 38 pounds are unaccounted for, Nichols said. The department did not immediately respond to an inquiry about where the missing mussels may have been sold.
The department announced a ban on harvesting clams, mussels, oysters and whelks in Down East areas a week ago in response to the toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom. It later extended a harvesting ban to parts of the Penobscot River and Cobscook Bay.
On Wednesday, the department decided there was no risk from the biotoxin and reopened those areas. There is still a ban on harvesting clams, mussels, oysters and whelks between the southwest point of Mount Desert Island and Cranberry Point in Gouldsboro, and around Eastport and Lubec at the easternmost tip of the state. A precautionary ban on harvesting mussels, European oysters and surf clams is still in place for some sections of coastline between Gouldsboro and Lubec, and around Vinalhaven, Isle Au Haut and Swan's Island.
Domoic acid is sometimes produced by intense blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia, a marine phytoplankton. The toxin stores in the flesh of bivalves like mussels, clams and oysters and can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning. Symptoms of amnesic shellfish poisoning include gastrointestinal upset, headache, confusion, dizziness, disorientation and memory loss. In extreme cases the poisoning can cause brain damage or death in humans
Symptoms begin within 24 hours of eating contaminated shellfish, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Tainted shellfish looks, smells and tastes normal, and cooking will not kill the toxin.
As of this week, the department's health division had not received any reports of people sickened by the potentially tainted mussels.

Full text: Judge suspends lawyerï¿½s license
SACO ï¿½ A Maine attorney who resumed his law practice after a nine-month prison sentence for money laundering has been suspended from practicing law for six months following allegations of professional misconduct with a female client.
The Portland Press Herald reported Gary Prolman will begin his suspension Nov. 1 after last weekï¿½s ruling.
The judge said Prolman ï¿½took advantageï¿½ of his clientï¿½s vulnerability when he engaged in sexual acts with her.
Court documents show the woman stayed in the apartment above Prolmanï¿½s law office in March and April after leaving an abusive boyfriend.
Prolmanï¿½s attorney said his client ï¿½at no timeï¿½ acted inappropriately with the woman. He said they are ï¿½disappointedï¿½ with the judgeï¿½s decision.
Lawsuit: Police didnï¿½t protect 2 from attack
BANGOR ï¿½ Two women have filed a federal lawsuit saying police failed to protect them from a man serving a life sentence for a deadly rampage in Maine.
The Bangor Daily News reported 23-year-old Brittany Irish and her 57-year-old mother, Kimberly, said state police officers violated their civil rights when the officers refused to provide protection from Anthony Lord.
Lord was sentenced to life in prison in August after pleading guilty to killing two people and injuring four others.
Brittany Irishï¿½s boyfriend was one of the victims, and Lord set Kimberly Irishï¿½s barn on fire.
The womenï¿½s lawyer said while he has a high regard for state police, the officers made a mistake when refusing the women protection.
Compiled from wire reports Assistant Attorney General Christopher Taub declined to comment on the case.
Bank executive loses job over online posts
KENNEBUNK ï¿½ An executive at a Maine bank is out of a job because of anti-Muslim images posted on Facebook.
The Portland Press Herald reported Kennebunk Savings bank announced that it no longer employs a worker whose ï¿½personal Facebook page contained some disturbing and offensive images.ï¿½ Kennebunk Savings has not identified the executive.
The bankï¿½s vice president of corporate communications, Heather Harris, said the bank will not reveal the employeeï¿½s identity.
In an online statement, the bank said it ï¿½will not tolerate harassment, bullying, workplace violence or discrimination of any type.ï¿½
Deadline looming for union at BIW
BATH ï¿½ Bath Iron Works and a union representing more than 700 workers are trying to reach an agreement before weekï¿½s end to prevent a strike.
The Bath Marine Draftsmenï¿½s Association Local 3999 authorized a strike Sunday but returned to work as negotiations continued.
The union agreed not to strike and the company agreed not to engage in a lockout before a contract extension expires late Sunday.
Company spokeswoman Lisa Read said the company is negotiating in good faith.
The union is part of the United Autoworkers and represents technical designers at the shipyard.
Portland bans display of exotic animals
PORTLAND ï¿½ The display of wild and exotic animals will soon no longer be allowed in Portland after a unanimous city council vote.
On Monday, the Portland City Council voted to ban the use of big cats, elephants and other circus animals because of handling practices. The Portland Press Herald reported a Friday rodeo will go ahead as planned, as the ban exempts the display of cattle, horses, swine, sheep and goats.
Portland joined over 100 municipalities nationwide to pass a ban on the display of wild and exotic animals. According to animal rights groups, Portland is the first city in Maine to pass such a ban.
Nobody testified against the proposed ban Monday, but more than a dozen supporters urged the council to adopt it.
Algea causes shellfish closure expansion
CALAIS ï¿½ Maine regulators are expanding a shellfish harvesting ban along the stateï¿½s central and eastern coast that follows a harmful algae bloom.
The bloom resulted in a recall of mussels last week. The state Department of Marine Resources has closed a section of the Penobscot River north of Stockton Springs and a section of Cobscook Bay south of Eastport to harvesting of shellfish.
The Portland Press Herald reported the state has also expanded a precautionary harvesting ban as far east as Calais, which is on the Canadian border.
Harvesting had been suspended in Frenchman Bay east of Mount Desert Island after mussels tested at elevated levels of domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by an algae bloom. It can cause sickness, memory loss and brain damage in humans.
NSF giving $100K to help lake study
ORONO ï¿½ The National Science Foundation is giving $100,000 to help with a University of Maine citizen science project geared at protecting the water quality of lakes.
The project began in 2015. The university said the grant will help extend it into next year and beyond.
UMaine said Maine lakes contribute about $4 billion to the stateï¿½s economy through recreational and other uses. They are also experiencing a decline in water quality.
UMaine said one of the biggest concerns is nutrients stimulating the growth of aquatic plant life, which results in depletion of dissolved oxygen. That can harm the health of the ecosystem and lead to higher treatment costs for lakes that are used as a source of drinking water.
The universityï¿½s project involves developing a ï¿½lake vulnerability index.ï¿½
Portland, NH town OKs holiday change
Maineï¿½s largest city and a New Hampshire town have voted to recognize the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoplesï¿½ Day.
Portlandï¿½s City Council and town councilors in Durham, New Hampshire, approved the measure Monday, which honors those who lived on the continent before it was colonized by western Europeans rather than Christopher Columbus.
Durham councilors considered calling it ï¿½The Age of Exploration and Indigenous Peoplesï¿½ Day,ï¿½ but then voted to eliminate the first part.
Other Maine communities have voted for a similar change.
Italian-Americans opposed the proposal in Portland. They said Columbus Day is less a celebration about one individual and more a celebration of Italian-American heritage.
The Portland Press Herald reported City Councilor Spencer Thibodeau said the proposal was about including indigenous people in the historical discussion, rather than excluding Italian-Americans.
Mainer, Holocaust survivor dies at 102
PORTLAND ï¿½ A 102-year-old Maine resident and Holocaust survivor has died.
The Portland Press Herald reported Kurt Messerschmidt died Sept. 12 at a Portland hospital, 72 years after surviving a ï¿½death marchï¿½ toward the end of World War II.
Messerschmidt was a leader in the local Jewish community. He led choir groups and taught music programs at Temple Beth El before retiring in 1985.
He married his wife, Sonja, in 1944 while they were prisoners at a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia.
The two were separated by the Nazis but reunited at a refugee center in Germany months after the war ended. Sonja Messerschmidt died in 2010.
A lifelong musician, Messershmidt told the newspaper in 2004 he ï¿½presented the beauty of what they (the Nazis) tried to destroy.ï¿½

Full text: Maine DEP's oil spill removal team is doing drills this week along the Kennebec River, including on Tuesday in the area around Swan Island and Richmond.
RICHMOND ï¿½ There was no oil spill Tuesday afternoon on the Kennebec River, but for several hours, members of the stateï¿½s hazardous materials cleanup teams pretended otherwise.
Off the eastern shore of Swan Island, they used boats and anchors to stretch yellow barriers across the river, trying to protect sensitive shellfish habitats from the imaginary oil slick floating on the surface.
But the currents were real as the responders adjusted the yellow barriers, known as containment booms. And their work had to be precise, because in a real spill, the right mix of wind and other elements easily could splash a pollutant over the sides of the booms if they were not placed properly, said Jeff Squire, director of response services in the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
Squire oversees four teams of people, spread across the state, who are called whenever oil and chemicals are spilled because of traffic accidents and other incidents. Besides trying to collect the materials that have spilled, they also investigate what might have caused the spill, Squire said.
While the teams commonly respond to spills involving petroleum products such as gasoline and home heating oil, they also help dispose of more obscure materials. For example, Squire described one recent response in which old containers of cyanide were found in the Rome property that the Travis Mills Foundation has converted to a retreat for wounded veterans. The cyanide was part of a pest control product, Squire said, but it is also poisonous to people.
Half of the stateï¿½s hazardous materials response workers will be on the Kennebec River all this week, practicing their marine response skills as part of an annual in-service training. Next week, the other half will participate in the same training.
On Monday, they donned waterproof survival suits and practiced cold water rescue work. On Thursday, theyï¿½ll be holding a drill in Hallowell.
They chose to do the training on this section of the Kennebec River because itï¿½s centrally located and includes difficult currents, Squire said. They have been using a classroom space on Swan Island, a wildlife preservation area operated by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife.
ï¿½Every year, the focus and subject matter (of the training) will vary depending on organizational assessments,ï¿½ Squire said. ï¿½This year, we found a need to enhance some of our waterborne skills with regards to pollution and oil spill response.ï¿½
Last year, Squire said, the division held its training at a potato refrigeration facility operated by McCain Foods in Presque Isle, to give workers experience in a different type of setting where they might have to clean up hazardous materials.
One of the Maine DEP workers on Swan Island this week, Tiffany LaClair, recently returned from a weeklong oil-spill training course Corpus Christi, Texas, where they used peat moss to simulate the way oil will float in water.
LaClair has worked for the stateï¿½s response division for just six months, after working in another part of the Maine DEP for about three years, she said. She used to clean waterways while working as a park ranger in Massachusetts, she said, and she welcomed the opportunity to do similar work in Maine.
During one of the exercises Tuesday afternoon, she lay an anchor on Swan Island that would hold one end of a containment boom getting stretched across the river.
The exercises were useful, she said, because they helped show ï¿½what can go wrongï¿½ in any response, whether itï¿½s a misplaced boom or mechanical failure on a watercraft.
ï¿½Youï¿½re never really sure what youï¿½re going to get,ï¿½ she said of the job. ï¿½Overall, itï¿½s great.ï¿½

Full text: I HAVE OWNED and operated an oyster farm on the coast of Maine for 32 years. Each year, we raise more than 100 million seed oysters, which we supply to other growers across the Eastern Seaboard, along with fully grown oysters we sell here in Maine and throughout the United States.
It's been a rewarding journey -- not everyone is lucky enough to spend their career working out on the Damariscotta River, or taste the fruits of their labor on the half shell. But that doesn't mean it's always been easy. Over the years, we've faced hurdles -- just as any business has. But now we face a new challenge: a bill in Congress that disguises itself as regulatory reform.
I know, firsthand, the frustration of complying with poorly conceived and executed rules and regulations. Yet I also can say, unequivocally, that without environmental regulations, my company would not be successful today and would very likely have gone out of business years ago. Let's be clear about the goals that should guide our elected leaders who enact laws and the government agencies that carry them out: to maintain and promote a strong economy while protecting public health and ensuring a clean environment. The Regulatory Accountability Act, currently making its way through Congress, seriously misses the mark on creating a framework in which all businesses can thrive.
My business is wholly dependent on clean coastal waters. In 1998, I was nearly put out of business by a septic tank pumper illegally emptying his truck 150 yards from our hatchery intake pipe. But many factors -- sometimes from distant sources -- can seriously affect the productivity of the ocean ecosystem I rely on.
For example, carbon emissions are causing acid levels in our coastal waters to increase as more CO2 dissolves in the water and freshwater runoff increases. Warming ocean temperatures are linked to the rise of pathogenic bacteria that can kill our oysters or make people sick. For us to avoid these threats and continue providing safe, healthy seafood to consumers, we must have clear, common-sense regulatory limits on pollution -- period.
I believe that Congress could pursue regulatory reform that provides targeted fixes to the process -- like bringing all stakeholders to the table earlier in the process and creating a schedule for reviewing rules at regular intervals. But the Regulatory Accountability Act is not the answer. Under the guise of regulatory reform, this proposal would add a new litany of bureaucratic hurdles, making it even harder for businesses like ours to navigate the already complex regulatory system.
Only in Washington would politicians try to solve the problem of slow bureaucracy with more bureaucracy. Yet that is exactly what the Regulatory Accountability Act proposes. The legislation imposes dozens of new procedural requirements; requires far-reaching, complex new analyses; sets in motion trial-like, formal hearing requirements; provides new avenues to petition for hearings; and includes many new legal avenues for court challenges.
And, potentially most importantly, it focuses only on the potential costs of regulations, and does not adequately balance those against benefits. This means that the benefit I provide to the local economy and our food supply will not be appropriately considered when calculating the cost of compliance for practices by other businesses that affect my operation. Rather than streamlining the process and providing for more regulatory certainty and accountability, the Regulatory Accountability Act will bring the regulatory process to a halt.
We've been harvesting oysters for over 30 years, and I hope we can do the same for decades to come. But to do so, we need a federal government capable of ensuring clean waters, setting responsible limits on pollution and providing a predictable business environment. In Maine, the aquaculture industry is growing rapidly, creating good jobs and diversifying Maine's marine economy. The Regulatory Accountability Act would take Maine, and our nation, in the wrong direction.
I hope Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King oppose this misguided legislation. If it passes, Wall Street firms and D.C. lobbyists might be thrilled, but small businesses like ours and Maine consumers will pay the price.

Full text: Harmful toxin might taint shellfish from 5 Down East dealers
Thousands of pounds of Maine shellfish are being recalled because of concerns they might be tainted with a potentially deadly marine neurotoxin.
The Department of Marine Resources issued a recall Friday of mussels harvested near Mount Desert Island from Sept. 10 to 14. Five Maine shellfish dealers are being asked to recall product.
This is only the second shellfish recall on record, said Jeff Nichols, a department spokesman. The only other recall was issued during a similar algae bloom last year.
The recall comes a day after the department's public health arm closed part of the Down East coast to shellfish harvesting after detecting elevated levels of domoic acid, a toxin produced by a large bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia phytoplankton. Shellfish such as mussels, clams and oysters eat phytoplankton and store toxin in their flesh. Domoic acid can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, which can result in illness, brain damage and memory loss. Mussel samples collected in Frenchman's Bay, between Bar Harbor and Gouldsboro, had levels of domoic acid higher than the safety threshold of 20 parts per million, the department said.
Kirk Loud, a manager at Atlantic Shellfish in Jonesport, said the company had to recall only 10 2-pound bags of mussels that were sold locally. The remaining product, about 5,000 pounds, is still at the company and will be destroyed, he said.
"As far as we are aware, nothing has seen the market," Loud said.
Maine's shellfish managers are experts at predicting red tide, another harmful algae bloom carrying a biotoxin that can cause paralysis or death. That's because red tide develops gradually and can be monitored carefully.
Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, however, are less predictable and intensify rapidly. While Pseudo-nitzschia is common in the Gulf of Maine, the first recorded toxic bloom occurred last fall and caught state officials and the shellfish industry by surprise.
Loud's impression is the department is unused to Pseudo-nitzschia blooms and is using an abundance of caution.
"This is new to them. They don't have their thumb on it yet. They want to be safe," he said.
"I am 100 percent with them on this," Loud said. "Better safe than sorry."
At Eastern Maine Mussel in Hancock on Friday afternoon, manager Ralph Robertson was trying to figure out exactly where recalled mussels were and how many would have to be destroyed. The company sells shellfish nationwide, mostly to wholesalers, Robertson said.
"Hopefully, it is still all on trucks. That would make it easier," he said. Every shellfish dealer has a protocol ready in case of a recall and can find out where the product is.
"Everything is dated, tagged and triple-checked. We have records on everything, when it was towed, packaged, shipped," Robertson said. "It is all well-documented.
Fiona de Koning, co-owner of Hollander and de Koning Mussels, did not disclose the precise amount of mussels her company had to recall, but she said it was "significant." De Koning tends five aquaculture leases around Mount Desert Island, which is at the center of the algae bloom. Most of the company's recalled mussels were still with distributors and had not reached consumers, de Koning said.
"It really is important that we can move quickly if something like that happens," de Koning said. "You want to catch it before it goes too far into the supply chain." This was de Koning's first recall, and she doesn't want to repeat the experience.
This is the second year in a row Maine has had to issue a recall because of a biotoxin scare. Last year, 5 tons of shellfish were recalled. Some product got as far as Missouri and Utah before it was returned. About 96 percent of the product was recalled, but about 430 pounds were unaccounted for.
Additional shellfish dealers who were notified of the mussel recall and are contacting their customers are Moosabec Mussels Inc. in Jonesport, Pemaquid Oyster Co. in Waldoboro and Steward GEM LLC in Bar Harbor.
The Department of Marine Resources said based on test results, mussels are the only product affected by the recall at this point. Closure areas will re-open when there are two consecutive scores from shellfish testing at least one week apart that are deemed safe, and there is a decline in the concentration of phytoplankton in the water.

Full text: A marine algae bloom that can carry a potentially deadly neurotoxin has forced the suspension of shellfish harvesting in parts of Down East Maine.
The Department of Marine Resources reported Thursday that it was monitoring an active bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia, an ocean phytoplankton carrying carry domoic acid, a toxin that can cause sickness, memory loss and brain damage in humans. This is the second year in a row a toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom has halted shellfishing along large parts of the coast.
Before 2016, there was no record of a toxic bloom of this type in the Gulf of Maine.
The department's public health section found levels of domoic acid that exceeded health standards in shellfish tested between Mount Desert Island and Gouldsboro. That area has been closed to harvesting and the department enacted a precautionary closure from Deer Isle to Machiasport, almost a third of Maine's coastline.
Department spokesman Jeff Nichols said officials were monitoring the situation closely. There is no indication contaminated shellfish have made their way to consumers, he said.
"It is impossible to determine at this point if the concentrations of domoic acid will increase in other areas. But we know that the phytoplankton that produces it grows rapidly, so we are carefully monitoring the entire coast and will be able to rapidly detect harmful levels of domoic acid and take action to protect the health of Maine's shellfish consumers," Nichols said.
Shellfishing areas routinely are closed by the state to protect consumers from tainted product because of stormwater runoff or "red tide," another kind of algae bloom that produces a toxin known to cause paralysis or death in humans.
There is no way to tell if the current bloom is a repeat of last year, when some shellfish samples had over 100 parts per million of domoic acid, more than five times the food safety limit. That bloom triggered the a rare recall of 5 tons of shellfish and an immediate harvesting suspension on a third of the state's coastline. It took more than a month to reopen all harvesting areas.
It's not yet clear what economic effect the current closure might have.
"We don't know how the bloom is developing or how extensive it is going to be," said Steve Archer, a senior research scientist with the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay, where the state's shellfish is tested.
"It is pretty small-scale at the moment, compared to what it was, It has a long way to go to match last year's event," he said.
Blooms can be triggered by a variety of environmental factors, and it is unknown if this event was caused by the same species of Pseudo-nitzschia as last year, he added.
Domoic acid, the toxin produced by Pseudo-nitzschia, is stored in shellfish tissue and can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, or ASP, if ingested. In a three-decade-old case from Prince Edward Island, two people died after eating shellfish tainted with domoic acid. Areas of the West Coast periodically undergo intense Pseudo-nitzschia blooms that have killed marine birds and mammals and caused extended closures of important fisheries such as razor clams and Dungeness crabs.
Fiona de Koning, co-owner of Hollander and de Koning mussels, spent Thursday morning calling customers to tell them about the closure. The company has five aquaculture leases around Mount Desert Island and Deer Isle. Currently, only one is outside the harvesting ban, de Koning said.
The Department of Marine Resources "has rigorous standards they stick to. That is why people have high confidence of the seafood from Maine," De Koning said. "They know it is safe and healthy and they can enjoy it.
"Our customers like to have a consistent supply; of course it is not ideal, but they understand."
Maine's shellfish monitors are experts at predicting toxic "red tide" blooms. In the spring and summer, when red tide typically blooms, state monitors conduct weekly water and shellfish flesh tests at about 80 sites in the state to test for elevated phytoplankton and toxin. Following the unexpected Pseudo-nitzschia bloom last September, the department updated protocols to monitor for a similar event and prevent another shellfish recall.
De Koning said she's never had a red tide closure, but her mussel farms, and at least two dozen other aquaculture leases for oysters and mussels are at the epicenter of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms for two years. It's a new problem, but uncertainty is part of farming shellfish, she said.
"This is just one of those things that happens when you are working with nature," de Koning said.
"Whatever nature throws at us we have to adapt to and learn from."

Full text: Zapoteca owners Shannon, Tom Bard being sued by vendors who say they weren't paid after restaurant closed
Celebrated chef Shannon Bard and her husband are facing at least a dozen lawsuits from vendors who say the couple left a trail of unpaid bills when they closed Zapoteca, their popular Portland restaurant, in June.
The restaurant was among the most highly regarded in Portland, and Bard was well known even beyond Maine, with appearances on cooking competition shows on the Food Network and a cookbook published two years ago. The restaurant operated on Fore Street for six years, but the couple said they decided to close it and concentrate on a restaurant and cooking school in their hometown of Kennebunk so they could spend more time with their children, who are in high school and college.
They made no mention of the lawsuits filed in Cumberland County courts that suggest increasing financial pressures on the restaurant starting last fall.
The suits paint a picture of Bard that is starkly at odds with her national reputation as an acclaimed restaurateur who has cooked at the world-famous James Beard House in New York.
In November, Independent Restaurant Supply of Portland, which sells silverware, furniture and kitchen equipment to restaurants, filed suit against the Bards, claiming it was owed $6,000 by Bard Enterprises, the parent company of Zapoteca.
In the suit, the company said Zapoteca had ordered supplies from the company through 2013 and after that made only occasional payments, "which ended in June 2015 along with any communication regarding their outstanding balance."
Dan Bornstein, the manager of the supply company, said he doesn't know the current status of the suit and declined to comment.
Shannon Bard did not return multiple messages left for her over two weeks at Toroso, her restaurant in Kennebunk. Several other numbers listed for her or Tom Bard had either been disconnected or went unanswered. The phone numbers that were still working gave no option to leave voicemail messages.
Responding to a message left at Toroso, Tom Bard, who operates Bard Enterprises, spoke briefly to the Portland Press Herald, playing down the couple's financial difficulties.
"We're working with everybody" to settle the bills, he said. "Closing down a restaurant is never an easy thing to do."
Bard said Zapoteca was "a good, strong, profitable restaurant," and suggested that some of the financial problems they have experienced stemmed from Mixteca, the restaurant the two operated in New Hampshire.
"Everything kind of got pushed up from there," he said before ending the phone interview.
"We're basically working through it, and that's all I've got to say about it," Bard said.
The lawsuits are at odds with Shannon Bard's reputation as a restaurateur in Portland and even national restaurant circles. The consistently well-reviewed Zapoteca, with its creative Mexican dishes, was considered a relative rarity in a city with a growing restaurant scene, but still known primarily for its seafood.
Bard also rose to popular fame through television cooking appearances. In 2014, Bard took home the top prize -- and a $25,000 check -- from the Food Network show, "Kitchen Inferno." The year before, she also gained exposure, but no title, when she faced off with Food Network star chef Bobby Flay in his TV series "Beat Bobby Flay."
She also cooked at the James Beard House in New York in 2014, considered a top honor by the nation's leading foundation focused on restaurants and cuisine. The foundation lauded Zapoteca as "an unlikely oasis of vibrant Mexican flavor in the hardy wilds of Maine."
Chefs are invited to cook -- "perform," in the James Beard Foundation's words -- based on their national or regional reputation and their knowledge and use of seasonal and/or local ingredients, among other factors. At her dinner, Bard prepared, among other dishes, a lobster, scallop and mussel chilpachole with a Maine oyster broth reduction and adobo glazed duck breast with cranberry-nut mole.
Izabela Wojcik, director of house programming for the Beard Foundation, said Bard's menu was "quite elegant."
Bard's dishes were "replete with regional Mexican dishes, but seen through a seasonal lens that highlighted the Maine bounty," she said. "It represented an opportunity to showcase a restaurant and chef and an exciting cuisine that we felt would be of interest to our guests."
Bard's cookbook, "The Gourmet Mexican Kitchen," came out the next year, but there were signs at the time Bards were concerned about finances.
In 2013, the Bards began to look for a space to open a second restaurant in Portland, although Tom Bard complained that finding affordable space in the city was close to impossible and the restaurant did not expand in the city.
Other creditors who have filed suit include a natural gas supplier, which says it is owed nearly $13,000, with court costs; Micucci's, an Italian grocer in Portland, which said the restaurant owes it nearly $900, with additional costs for its attempts to collect the money; a restaurant supply company, which says its $6,000 bill hasn't been paid; a food service company, which said it has an unpaid bill for slightly more than $10,000; and Republicash, a check cashing and payday loan company, which filed suit for $9,000 after it said the restaurant's paychecks to employees bounced.
Many of the suits were filed this spring and summer, while others date even further back, including one in which a New Hampshire landlord claims to be owed more than $70,000 for a restaurant named Mixteca that Bard operated in Durham, New Hampshire, and closed in January. That debt is impinging on Tom and Shannon Bard's private life, with a lien placed on the couple's 227-year-old, $440,000 house near downtown Kennebunk.
Casco View Holdings III, the landlord of the building that housed the Portland restaurant, also filed suit against Zapoteca, claiming the restaurant failed to pay its rent in January. The rent was more than $6,600 a month, with taxes, trash collection fees, water bills and a late fee pushing the tab to more than $10,000 a month.
Sergio Ramos, the former manager of Zapoteca, also has filed suit against the restaurant, saying the company hasn't paid him in line with the terms of his $50,000-a-year contract, which also had a provision that would allow him to buy a piece of the business, with increasing amounts depending on how long he worked there. The lawyer handling the suit for the former manager said the dispute has been ordered into arbitration and he declined to discuss the details.
Several of the lawsuits against the Bards were resolved as default judgments because the Bards did not show up to contest them. Other suits were filed as recently as three weeks ago and hearings have not yet been held.
Some of the suits illustrate how the amount owed can grow when companies have to go to court to settle an unpaid bill.
For instance, Agera Energy, the restaurant's natural gas supplier, filed suit after it claimed the Bards failed to pay a bill for $8,081. Interest added more than $1,700 to the tab, plus $3,000 for attorney's fees, for a total of $12,803.72. The lien filed by 6 Jenkins Court, the New Hampshire landlord of the restaurant there, is accruing interest at a rate of nearly 7 percent.
Kelly McDonald, the lawyer handling that suit for the New Hampshire company, declined to comment.
Trimark United, a food service and equipment supplier, said it is owed $10,007.90 by the Bards. That company's suit also alleges that Tom Bard changed a section in the credit agreement between the company and Bard, crossing out information indicating that the couple owned their house in Kennebunk and instead, writing that the house was rented, possibly an attempt to shield it if the company sought to collect any unpaid bills by putting a lien on the house. Trimark United's suit against the Bards indicates that the company is seeking half the value of the house, or $220,000, as a punitive measure.
Steve Hewins, president of the Maine Restaurant Association, declined to discuss Zapoteca or the Bards' situation, but said running a restaurant requires mastering a range of skills, not all of them compatible, that make it an especially difficult business to manage.
"Generally, the public would not really understand how complex running a restaurant is," Hewins said.
He noted that restaurateurs need to be skilled at managing an inventory of perishable supplies that need to be handled, stored and prepared in a safe manner.
In addition, a restaurant needs to be inviting and ready to accommodate the needs and desires of a range of customers, from people who eat out almost nightly to those for whom it's an occasional treat.
"You're hosting a dinner party every night," Hewins said. "You have to manage a wide spectrum of people who come in each night."
The duties also include managing a staff, which is particularly difficult now due to labor shortages in the state, especially in the summer. Restaurants have to pass frequent inspections by health officials. And finally, Hewins said, a restaurateur has to be creative enough to cook food that people want to eat and able to adapt to changing public tastes while putting in very long hours.
"I have great respect for the people that operate restaurants because most of the owners are in the store" juggling all those roles, he said.

Full text: Paul Naron whips out his measuring tape. Is that vendor with the popsicles infringing on unpaid territory, creeping past his or her rented 4 feet of booth space? Trailed by his assistant, Maddie Newton, he prowls the United Farmers Market of Maine like a smallish tiger in shorts, baseball cap and a hardware store apron.
He gives a running commentary of the unmanned booths as he goes; it's midweek and the market is only open on Saturdays. This vendor with the woodsie geegaws hasn't sold much and probably won't be around much longer, Naron says, but that's OK -- Naron and Newton are four to five people deep in prospective vendors eager to get into what Naron says is already the best indoor market in Maine. His ambition is for it to be the best indoor farmers market in the world -- never mind that Belfast has a population of fewer than 7,000 -- and Naron is thrumming with the excitement of someone who senses an impossible goal might be attainable after all.
"These guys have a llama farm," Naron says, waving the measuring tape at another booth.
"Alpaca," Newton corrects, softly. She just graduated from Unity College in May, within days of the opening of Naron's dream market, and has been helping him manage vendors, details and his streak of perfectionism since then.
Naron stops at Fancy Plants, a plant-based food stall. "My girlfriend is addicted to this stuff," Naron says, rapping the measuring tape on the counter. The chalkboard sign says "Gluten free, dairy free, sugar free." Addiction possibilities seem limited, at least to us. "Trust me," he says.
How's the Nitro coffee sold at the Farm House Coffee Roasters stand, the trendy stuff infused with nitrogen? "I can't drink coffee," he said.
When Kate Hall of Graze Maine, a Northport microgreens producer, was considering applying to be a vendor at the United Farmers Market, she got a tour from Naron himself. His style is hands-on, even if it means driving two hours to convince a farmer to rent a booth (rates start at $31.50 a month for a 4-foot space) or being inside when he could be out sailing.
Hall was new in the business, with less than a year under her belt, although already she was selling to restaurants, including Suzuki's Sushi Bar in Rockland and Natalie's at Camden Harbour Inn.
"He made this comment to me, like he'd see me 'when you get your act together,'" Hall remembered. She could have taken it as an insult, but instead, it felt like a challenge. "And I just looked at him. And I was like 'Yeah, I have got my act together.'"
The exchange established a connection. "I really like Paul," Hall says.
"He just wants to make sure that we are all as invested in this as he is," she added. "I have a lot of appreciation for what he has done as a businessman and for the local farmers. Not many people would invest so much money in other people and in the community this way that he has."
Naron, 67, is a Baltimore native who made a tidy living with a hardware chain in southeast Florida. He started with a staff of four and sold the business when it had expanded to over 100 employees. About eight years ago, he bought a house in Belfast, a place he knew from sailing and had come to like very much. The house he bought was on a corner and had a great view of Belfast Bay. To the left of it and just across the street was an old window factory belonging to Mathews Brothers, which has been manufacturing windows in Belfast since 1854. They were using the 1980s building, which isn't much to look at from the outside, as a showroom, but the factory was elsewhere in town, out on Perkins Road.
The building was for sale, and Naron eyed it. It came with about an acre of land. It seemed suited to some sort of retail business. Those were skills he already had. He knew what a commercial property this size (30,000 square feet) would go for in booming Portland down the coast. "I was staring at this building," he said. He made an offer. They didn't bite. He kept staring.
One of Naron's earliest memories is going to Lexington Market in Baltimore with his grandfather and watching fishmongers shucking oysters. As an adult, he visited indoor markets in Canada, including one in Frederictown, New Brunswick, that struck him as an indoor market done right. He is a believer in buying both lettuce at the farmers market, and a nice lunch, and then eating the lunch in a place with a view.
As Naron mulled over a growing vision of an indoor market like that, in Belfast, he reached out to townspeople and farmers and managers at the Belfast Farmers Market.
"He came to us five or six years ago," Anne Segeese, the manager of the Belfast Farmers Market, which is on Fridays, is 37 years old and also runs year-round, moving to a greenhouse in Belfast's Aubuchon Hardware store from November to April. "He always references one up in Canada. He even sponsored a field trip up there and took a couple of market managers," she said.
"We all got to know each other pretty well," Segeese added.
But by the time Naron made another offer on the Mathews Brothers building, the one that was accepted, they'd made up their minds. "In the end, we decided to decline his offer and the primary reason was that it would be his gig. He called the shots."
Meaning, longstanding rules, typical at farmers markets, about say, the vendors also being the producers, could be put aside. The Belfast Farmers Market operates as a democracy, with committees discussing and voting on changes. They didn't want a boss, no matter how generous.
But the new market, Segeese says, is "beautiful."
"It is a great asset to Belfast," she said. Not that there weren't anxieties about competition and duplication. She'd have rather that Naron chose a different name. He changed it from the United Farmers Market of Belfast to the United Farmers Market of Maine, but the website is still belfastmarket.com. There's been enough confusion that the Belfast Farmers Market rebranded itself in many materials as "the original market serving Belfast."
"We needed some way to say, 'Hey, we are still here,' " Segeese said. "I had a city councilor say to me, 'I heard you guys are moving over to Mathews Brothers!'" So far the markets seem to have a different customer base, Segeese said, with Naron's market making a lot of people who can't ditch work on Friday to shop happy.
It's also appealing to new vendors. Kate Hall was ready to expand her customer base for Graze, but traditional farmers markets weren't that appealing to her. "Because I didn't have time to break down and set up."
Ditto for Lou Harris, the farmer behind Abraham's Cheesery.
"We never really did farmers markets," Harris said of his Newport goat farm, which produces goat meat, milk, cheese and yogurt. The beauty of his 8-foot booth in Belfast is that the freezer and refrigerator case stay put. Convenient and "so much cleaner," Harris said. "You are not reaching into a cooler full of dirty ice to get your product out."
"It's a totally different beast," Segeese said. She hopes that Naron keeps the place thriving, long after the summer tourists are gone; no hard feelings, she said.
"It was not all fruits and rainbows, but we're cool," she said.

The very same day Naron closed on the Mathews Brothers building, he ordered windows for a 3,000-square-foot corner of it, the one that faces the bay, same view as his house basically but mostly hidden (the window factory had had some windows, but small ones). Now shoppers can sit at the tables and watch the boat traffic in Belfast Bay.
"This is really where it all started," Naron said, resting -- briefly -- on one of the tables he built himself for the room, borrowing the model from the ones chef Erin French built for The Lost Kitchen in nearby Freedom. "To make this room."
When he was driving around to farms and inviting vendors to come visit, he used the room as a lure. A room with a view, where people would not sit with their laptops or phones (in Naron's world, a hugely disappointing social evolution) but rather, with each other.
"I wouldn't have done it without this room, this place where people can break bread together and have this beautiful view," he said, "because that is the soul of the place."
The transformation from the real estate closing to the market's opening day in late May was only about 18 months, he said. But he's far from done. What you see at the market is only half the building's capacity, and he's busy mapping out a commercial kitchen and possibly an event center in those hidden spaces (the Belfast Maskers rented the space for its production of "Annie" this summer).
"There might be a world-class restaurant here at some point," he said, mentioning chefs from top Maine restaurants who he said were interested in opening a restaurant together in Belfast. "But I'm not counting on that."
Even on a down day in early August, the United Farmers Market of Maine was filled with activity. Workmen were delivering the equipment for a hydroponic growing station that Kate Hall will help oversee ("We want to be able to show people things growing," Naron said). Downstairs, off the loading dock, artist David Hurley was putting the finishing touches on a 24-foot-tall lettuce leaf (his carrot was already up), and then an Amish couple showed up.
Mary and Levi Miller had taken both bus and taxi to get from Sherman to Belfast. They had an appointment to see Naron, to show him their traditional baskets. With the help of the taxi driver who had brought them on the last leg, they set up their wares in the room with the windows.
But problematically, they were looking for someone who could sell their goods for them. It would never be feasible to take public transport on a three-hour journey each direction every Saturday morning.
Naron was nonplussed. "I love the look," he said under his breath. Mary and Levi Miller were in full Amish garb, from bonnet to breeches. Naron examined the baskets. He picked up potholders that cost just a few dollars. He pushed a woven basket that was also a lazy Susan and watched it spin. "I love lazy Susans," he said.
When things go wrong at the market, like when the fish guy's freezer stopped working, Hall said Naron typically steps in to buy whatever has been lost. Or in some cases, the extras "That has happened more than once."
With the Millers looking on, their likely three-hour journey home ahead of them, and no future at the United Farmers Market of Maine ahead of them (the place is humming with technology; not exactly Amish country). Naron began to pile up potholders onto a lazy Susan, wondering aloud, would the lazy Susans work in this room? Did they go with anything?
Not really. But he sent Newton off to cut the Millers a check. He'd buy a few things anyway. "The least I can do is pay for your cab ride," he said.

Full text: Thornton Academy program helps to find jobs for graduates, fill hole in workforce
Tom Teague had never been inside a factory until his Thornton Academy class toured Pratt & Whitney's North Berwick plant, which, among other things, makes parts for some of the most sophisticated aircraft in the world, including Lockheed Martin's fifth-generation F-35 and F-22 fighter jets. Now, he's working at the plant following an internship at Pratt & Whitney in collaboration with Saco-based Thornton, an independent school serving grades 6 through 12.
The 2-year-old internship program at Thornton, the first in the country to use a hands-on curriculum developed by a machinists' association, is trying to find good jobs for its graduates and fill a gaping hole in Maine's workforce.
Teague, who now works full time for the company, isn't as intimidated as he was the first time he stepped through Pratt & Whitney's doors as a student.
"When I first started, I was scared to come into a huge machine shop," he said. "This is my first job. I'm glad I did it."
Thornton's program combines an online curriculum from the National Tooling & Machining Association, or NTMA, with hands-on experience at Pratt & Whitney and other Maine manufacturers, including Yale Cordage and Arundel Machine Tool, to expose students to options of a career in manufacturing -- an area in which Maine needs skilled labor. Pratt & Whitney, which has 1,700 employees, has more than 50 positions open in North Berwick, while the state as a whole has more than 700 positions open in all aspects of manufacturing, according to the job site Indeed.com.
It's a business segment that is critical to the state's economic health, contributing $5.1 billion in economic output and accounting for about 9 percent of Maine's gross state product, according to the Maine 2015 Manufacturing Summit Report. Some 1,775 factories employ more than 54,900 individuals, according to the Maine Department of Labor. The average annual salary for workers in manufacturing was $66,653, according to 2014 State Manufacturing Data figures.
Thornton was the first high school in the country to adopt the NTMA curriculum, which was targeted at workers already in the field who wanted to hone their skills and adapted for students.
"Parents see jobs in manufacturing as a career-limiting step," said Russ Chaput, human resources manager at Pratt & Whitney. "Here (in Maine) there aren't many jobs you can come to without a university degree and still grow and learn and make a salary to live."
Teague's classmate Nick Claesson is also a Pratt & Whitney employee now.
"I thought of factories as having smoke under the ceilings," he said before he toured the facility. "This one was different than I imagined."
Like Teague, Claesson said he's glad he chose a manufacturing career. "There's a lot of opportunity at Pratt & Whitney. I found a career, not just a job," said Claesson, who worked part time at a Market Basket supermarket while he was in high school. "I have income, benefits, a comfortable living in the future and a full career here."
Not that there aren't challenges. Claesson acknowledges the military line grinders, which sheer off extra metal from the fine parts for the jets, can be nerve wracking to operate.
"The grinders are a high-volume unit for military and commercial use," said Ron Enders, operations manager at Pratt & Whitney, who helped oversee Claesson and Teague as interns and now as employees. "They take large hunks of exotic metals and turn them into parts for jet engines that you see at airports or in the F-35 and F-22 fighter jets. The grinders remove metal by abrading versus cutting. Some materials are so hard you can't cut them with the CNC (computer numerical control) lathe. It will destroy your machine."
Claesson said the NMTA class did cover metallurgy, the study of the physical and chemical behavior of metals and metallic compounds, to prepare for the production work.
"The hardest part of the job is the standard of quality because it can be a very tight tolerance," said Claesson, referencing the machine work.
Enders said the company has more than 100 different job codes, offering a lot of opportunity to employees to advance or try something different.
The North Berwick factory is 1 million square feet, making it the largest manufacturer in Maine, according to Chaput. The company's headquarters are in East Hartford, Connecticut, and overall revenue was about $14 billion in 2015. It is a subsidiary of United Technologies (NYSE: UTX), a $56 billion aircraft maker based in Farmington, Connecticut.
Of the 10 Thornton students who enrolled in the first NMTA program and performed internships, all 10 graduated and have internships, jobs or went to college, said Rene Menard, headmaster of Thornton. The program requires students to commit to six semesters, with classes meeting about 80 minutes daily or about 300 hours per semester in the sophomore, junior and senior years to total 1,800 hours.
There also are labs. To get a job, typically starting in machine tooling, the students must first graduate from Thornton and be 18 years old.
"It's a public relations challenge because there is a perception that manufacturing is dead," said Menard. "We did marketing to change that perspective. We said there are highly skilled manufacturing jobs in Maine and there's a gap filling them. So we went out to visit companies like Pratt & Whitney, Arundel and Yale Cordage."
Some 100 students at Thornton were interested in getting into the competitive NTMA and internship program, said Allan Young, an administrator at the school. "We looked at their math and science skills, attendance and other factors and whether they had what it takes to complete the program," he said.
That also includes the soft skills of learning to work with others with different backgrounds, experience levels and genders. Tom Narciso, who teaches at Thornton and at Southern Maine Community College, helps with both the student labs and the knowledge of the soft skills.
"Precision manufacturing is what this is all about," he said. "Anyone who endeavors to be in this trade needs to use math, geometry and have a work ethic. It's not for everyone."
However, those who pursue the job can get $10-$15 an hour out of high school and $20 an hour after four or five years. They can rise rapidly, with a 30-year tool maker earning up to $40 an hour, Narciso said.
The demand is not expected to lessen in the near future as older workers in manufacturing are nearing retirement age, just as they are in other industries in Maine where the average age is 43.8, the oldest in the nation.
"Baby boomers are retiring out of manufacturing. We won't have the numbers to do the labor," said Narciso. "In another decade, the world will be their (young employees') oyster."
Not all students come out of the internships clearly fixed on a career in machine tooling and manufacturing. Sarah Picard, who also was in the first NMTA class of Thornton students, thought she wanted to go into the trades because her dad is an electrician. But she's now studying at the University of Maine in Orono and toggling between art education and engineering.
"I can't picture myself doing machining full time," said Picard, who interned at Yale Cordage. "But I would get into machining and then later be a teacher or own an art studio."
Still, she said she liked the class at Thornton and the help from teachers.
"This is a good opportunity. There is high demand for machinists, especially in Maine. Trades are a good thing to get into," she said. "There aren't a lot of girls in this industry. But at Yale Cordage they taught me that it doesn't matter that I'm a girl. They taught me a lot."
Narciso said the demand for precision manufacturing jobs will remain high because they are integrated into many different kinds of industries, such as medical device manufacturing and ship and boat building. The NMTA is an innovative way to introduce students into a career path, he said.
"Thornton isn't afraid of innovative things. They deserve kudos."

Full text: MAINE ISLANDS ARE very special but challenging places to live year-round. In the last 100 years we've gone from 300 to just 15 year-round island communities.
So we're especially fortunate to have the Island Institute, which focuses much of its attention on island issues and challenges. I love the institute's regular Working Waterfront newspaper, which I receive online, and I learned a lot from their interesting stories in the new edition of their magazine, Island Journal.
In the new edition, I particularly enjoyed Howie Montenko's astonishing photos, using a technique known as "light painting." He assembles a crew of islanders at dusk to shine handheld flashlights that "paint" the scene with light while Monteko creates a long-exposure photo. They are absolutely stunning.
The list of island challenges is lengthy, from no broadband and extremely high energy costs to rising tides and warming oceans to maintaining schools and year-round jobs. Thankfully, the Island Institute is working on all of these challenges.
I've been intrigued by some of their initiatives to bring efficient energy to the islands. Their Energy Planning for Island Communities Initiative is providing technical resources and tools to communities to help achieve their clean energy goals.
In July of last year experts from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory met with energy leaders and community members on Isle au Haut and Monhegan islands to learn about their priorities and identify cost-effective ways for those islands to transition to clean energy systems. Island Institute also crated the Spark! Fund, a competitive grant program providing awards of up to $2,000 for island and coastal energy projects.
The institute's Aquaculture Business Development Program is helping aspiring seaweed and shellfish farmers get started. Nine new businesses were launched in the first year of this program. In the next five years they expect this project to have an $8.3 million impact on Maine's economy.
And I have a friend working in Frenchboro on Long Island as an Island Fellow. The institute has many fellows working on our islands in a variety of jobs and projects, including schools, energy efficiency, town management, fire and safety, elder care, and more.
Their educational programs are very important, including Outer Islands Teaching and Learning Collaborative, scholarships and Island Scholars Network, and Distance Learning Technology. In the latter program, they partnered with tech company EPlus in 2009 and again in 2014 to secure significant USDA-Rural Development grant funds to install cutting-edge teleconferencing and video recording equipment at 24 sites, including Maine's island and remote coastal schools and other rural coastal community schools in Alaska and St. John, Virgin Islands. The equipment allows for highly interactive networking among students and connects them to resources at universities and other educational organizations. Wonderful!
Maine's islands are life-changing places for many. If you read the Travelin' Maine(rs) columns that Linda and I write, you know we love Monhegan island. In the new edition of the Island Journal, there's a great interview with Mott Feibusch, a young man who first visited Monhegan in the summer of 1990 and moved there to live year-round in 2015. When asked if he had a favorite story or memory of Maine, this is what Mott said.
"I visited Monhegan for the first time in winter about 10 years ago. I made frames and painted with the artist Ted Tihansky for a couple of weeks. During that time, there was a blizzard on the island, and we ate fresh shrimp from a five-gallon bucket. We also had a Valentine's dinner for 12 people, hiked out to Burnt Head and painted the moon rising on found pieces of tile, made bracelets of discarded copper pipe, and torched sculptures and frames chasing an aesthetic unique to Ted. It was a great introduction to the community I had known from only one perspective. Without that experience, I wouldn't be the person I am today."
Today, Mott is the island's third assessor and assistant fire chief. He works for the power company, pours beer at the island's wonderful brewery, and owns a woodworking business. With his partner, Carley Mayhew, Monhegan's postmaster, Mott is now roasting coffee, hoping to turn that into a year-round business. Yup, year-round residency on our islands requires lots of jobs.

Full text: AS A LOBSTERMAN for more than 30 years, I have a direct connection to the ocean and its abundance. It's how I make my living, and I've seen it shape my way of life and the people around me. Fishing and seafood are an inextricable part of Maine's heritage and culture, and it's thanks to good conservation practices in the lobster fishery that we enjoy the bounty reflected in our record landings of late.
But keeping this way of life requires a continuation of good decision-making now -- not only for the health of our ocean, but also for the health of Mainers and our economy. Cutting carbon emissions is an imperative element of that, and we can't settle for either the status quo or a return to the times and policies that paid little heed to the environment around us.
One program on the state and regional level that has shown great success already, but now faces an imminent decision on its future, is the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. After a 20-month review, a choice must be made on the amount of carbon reduction required -- which directly translates into protecting Maine's people and resources.
Maine is one of nine states (along with Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont) that participate in an interstate cap-and-invest system that limits carbon dioxide emissions from power companies and allows them to buy and sell permits for the emissions they create. The revenue from auctioning off these permits is put to work to further reduce emissions, providing funding for energy-efficiency programs and helping pay power bills.
RGGI has been an unparalleled success -- it's a shining example of how states can lead the way to low carbon-based economies. When initiated in 2009, doomsayers predicted huge jumps in the cost of power, lost jobs and a faltering economy. Instead, RGGI has:
[bullet] Grown regional employment by more than 30,000 job-years.
[bullet] Reduced electricity rates in member states by 3.4 percent (while the price grew in non-RGGI states).
[bullet] Contributed to 25 percent growth in member state economies (again outpacing non- RGGI states).
[bullet] Saved utility customers $618 million on their energy bills to date, with billions more expected over these measures' lifetimes.
[bullet] Provided public health benefits valued at $5.7 billion (and that's just the estimated benefit from the reduction in CO2; other illness-causing pollution has been cut as well).
[bullet] Reduced carbon pollution from power plants by 40 percent (outperforming the rest of the country).
These results speak for themselves. But for me, cutting carbon is more personal: It's very real and is essential for protecting our oceans. About 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed by the ocean, and the resulting chemical reactions cause ocean acidification. Acidification, as the video "A Climate Calamity in the Gulf of Maine Part 2" shows, is especially harmful to creatures with shells. This means oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, crab and, yes, lobsters, too.
Research indicates that the Gulf of Maine is particularly vulnerable to acidification. It's also warming 99 percent faster than the rest of the world's oceans (carbon pollution carries the blame there as well). It's time for seafood lovers to speak up to ensure that the abundance we've enjoyed for so long continues.
While scientists are exploring ways to adapt to our changing waters, we have to address the root cause: carbon emissions. RGGI is the best tool that Maine has to do this. The decision that's up for debate is whether RGGI's cap will continue to decline at only 2.5 percent annually, or whether we adopt more ambitious caps of up to 3.5 percent a year from 2021 through 2030. The difference could mean an extra 99 million short tons of carbon eliminated by 2030. That's more than a year's worth of emissions for the region at a cost to utilities of less than one-tenth of a penny per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Why wouldn't we jump at such a cost-effective chance to reduce emissions?
Unbelievably, Maine is one of the states balking at the higher cap, even though the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative subsidizes our electricity rates, making them the lowest in New England. Now is the time to speak up for the health of our ocean, our people, and our economy. RGGI's cap should increase to 3.5 percent annually, getting us closer to our climate policy goals and ensuring that the Maine way of life continues for generations to come.

Full text: ancy McBrady, the executive director of the Wild Blueberry Association of North America, stood in the kitchen at Fork Food Lab in Portland watching chefs from national restaurant chains (such as Applebee's) and food service corporate kitchens (such as Sysco) compete to make the best dish from a box full of Maine ingredients. The star was wild blueberries, both fresh and frozen, and all around the commercial kitchen, 10 chefs were pureeing, sauteeing and garnishing with Maine's tiny native berry.
Meanwhile, McBrady was speaking frankly about trouble in the wild blueberry business.
"The industry is actually facing a lot of difficulty right now," McBrady said, listing off a series of factors, particularly a glut of frozen berries, that have led to such depressed prices that farmers are taking huge losses. Some berries may be left on the vines as a result; the Passamaquoddy Wild Blueberry Company, which has 1,000 acres of wild blueberries on tribal land and typically harvests about 7 million pounds, announced it will skip this year's harvest. The stark reality is that some of these farmers might spend more harvesting than they would make on the crop, and that's assuming they could even find a buyer.
Just a month ago, the United States Department of Agriculture agreed to buy $10 million worth of the 2017 crop - the third year in a row and the fourth time in six years that the federal government will subsidize the state's wild
blueberry growers. And at a good rate; last year the government paid between 96 cents and $1.24 per pound, more than three times the amount growers received from processors.
Despite the need for that subsidy, the participating chefs at late July event at Fork Food Lab had spent the previous two days dining out at top Portland restaurants, including Vinland (lunch at Eventide would come after the competition), touring an organic blueberry farm in Dresden and a seaweed farm in Casco Bay, all courtesy of the Wild Blueberry Association of North America's marketing and promotion budget. The night before they'd ordered everything on Scale's menu. Now they had 90 minutes to pull together an entree using lobster, pureed seaweed, oyster mushrooms, local ginger, cornmeal and of course, wild Maine blueberries.
"What you're seeing is the yin and yang of wild blueberries," McBrady said.
The yin, she said, is the association's work on behalf of the commodity, lobbying the government to buy a crop growers are having trouble selling. The yang is building a future market for a berry that is so geographically specific - in America it grows in great swaths of commercially harvestable land only in Maine - that it remains an unknown to many consumers and to decision makers in the food service industry. Hence events like this one, which the association had labeled "Eating on the Wild Side," intended to emphasize the intensity of the wild blueberries flavor as well as its health benefits of wild blueberries, which research from the USDA has shown have twice the antioxidant power - disease fighting! alleviating aging issues! - of conventional high bush blueberries. Working with Westbrook-based Ethos Marketing & Design, the commission has made strides in consumer awareness in recent years, quadrupling traffic to its website (wildblueberries.com), getting more than 6,000 mentions in national mainstream media in 2016 and more than 320,000 Facebook likes, up sixfold since 2013.
"While we are working really hard to find short-term relief, if you will, with the bonus buy," McBrady said, referring to the USDA's purchasing program. "The yang to that is that we are doing thoughtful outreach to the trades and through marketing efforts like this," McBrady added. "We have to be thinking broadly."
Every commodity requires marketing, but arguably, the Maine wild blueberry is in particular need of a fierce campaign to reach consumers. It faces stiff competition from Canada, where the bulk of the world's wild blueberries grow naturally. Maine growers have worked hard to improve their yields, and in recent years the state's 44,000 acres of blueberry fields have produced just over 100 million pounds annually. Crops have been good, but to the north, where the weak Canadian dollar means berries can be purchased more cheaply for American markets, yields have also improved at the same time as growers have expanded their growing regions.
While wild blueberries are native crops, clearing land for them allow the plants to spread, thus expanding farms. In Quebec alone, yields had been between 70 and 80 million pounds annually, according to David Yarborough, a wild blueberry specialist with the University of Maine Cooperative Extension who works as a consultant to the Wild Blueberry Association of North America. Newly cleared fields in Quebec led to a 126 million pound yield in 2016, a more than 50 percent increase. That's a major reason for the glut.
So too is the availability of conventional blueberries - from cultivated high bush plants - on the market, Yarborough said. So many are coming in from areas like the Pacific Northwest that he said 400 million pounds of the American grown high bush blueberries end up frozen annually. Since wild blueberries don't travel well fresh, the Maine crop that leaves the state is almost entirely processed and flash frozen, thus frozen conventional berries are direct competition.
The larger Maine growers, some of whom also have fields in Canada, like Wyman's, still have product left in their freezers from the last growing season, despite last year's USDA buy-back program, which took 11.7 million pounds, ultimately valued at $12.2 million. The berries were delivered to every state but Alaska, Hawaii and Rhode Island in 2016. Then state agencies distributed them to food bank networks locally, according to a USDA spokesman.
Because of that glut, Yarborough said, Maine growers decided to cut back on production this year. Whereas typically they'd bring in 50 million hives of honeybees to assist with pollination - and even in some years, up to 80 million - this year Maine growers rented 27 million hives in anticipation of another tough year for sales. "The hives are expensive," he said.
Yarborough expects with fewer pollinators and a wet, cold spring that made spraying for pests a challenge, this year's crop will be 25 percent smaller than last year's.
That's not a bad thing though, given the market. Ten years ago, farmers got about $1 per pound, last year prices hovered under 30 cents, about 20 cents less per pound than it costs to grow them.
"Having a large crop again is probably not good, at least not until we can get the demand back up," Yarborough said.
To avoid such losses, the Passamaquoddy tribe announced it wouldn't be harvesting this year; typically they sell to Cherryfield Foods Inc., but Cherryfield told the tribe in February that it would not be buying from Passamaquoddy Wild Blueberry Co. (The tribe is suing for breach of contract.) "We were totally blindsided," said Brian Altvater, the president of the tribe's blueberry company. He said typically about 600 local rakers harvest about 7 million pounds. "It's a real hit to the local economy." Are other blueberry growers mowing their fields, rather than harvesting? "That's an unknown," Yarborough said. He's heard from a few others having trouble, and at this point in the season, he said finding buyers is unlikely. "If they are smaller growers without contracts, then they probably aren't going to sell them."
"You could do some fresh market but if you aren't set up for it, there are really not a lot of good alternatives."
USDA has been assisting producers of agricultural crops since the 1930s with what are known as "emergency removals" and distributed as "bonuses." Up until 2012, the USDA had never swooped in to buy Maine wild blueberries, despite major fluctuations in prices (in 2002, farmers were getting 28 cents a pound, for instance; in 2007, they went for $1 a pound, but by 2009 they'd dropped to 36 cents).
But in that 2012 growing season, Maine's Washington delegation helped lobby for a 10-million pound buy, ultimately valued at $15.6 million. The next fiscal year, USDA bought $14 million worth of Maine blueberries. Last year the federal government spent $298 million on emergency removals of mostly fruits, vegetables and meat products, so wild blueberries were just, pardon the expression, a drop in the bucket. In the 2015 season, a freeze reduced yields in Canada, so there was no need for federal assistance.
But with this year's announcement of another buyback, is relying on USDA for an infusion of cash to the growers becoming a habit?
"I certainly do not want this to be a long-term strategy," McBrady said. "I mean, no one does. I do think that in a situation where we haven't found the right footing between supply and demand, there is a federal resource that is meant for a situation like this, to support American agriculture. And we should at least request it and see if they come through."
Those requests have been backed by the entire Maine Congressional delegation, she said. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, who represents the 2nd Congressional District, where most of the blueberry farms are, is "a wonderful advocate," McBrady said. "He was on board the moment we told him we were thinking about pursuing this, and he helped with outreach to USDA."
"If we need to ask for a few more bonus buys, we will," she said. "But I don't anticipate, once we crawl out of this, that we will ask for more. We are not going to be like, 'Hey that bonus buy was great, can we have another?'
But the wild blueberry crop is special and should be protected, she said. "We are the only state in America that does this. We need to survive. We should survive. We will survive." The blueberry experts remain optimistic about the future. When Yarborough called to discuss the challenges facing the industry, he was on the road. He'd just left a consulting gig in Township 7, where he said a forestry company was looking into bringing in wild blueberries in areas that had recently been logged (wild blueberries typically can be found in the woods; clearing the canopy gives them room to take over). They were still interested, despite the issues plaguing growers."I guess somebody has got some faith," he said.
Another positive sign for wild blueberries is in production of organic berries, which have not been subject to such wild price fluctuations and consistently get a far higher price.
"Demand is good and sales are good," Yarborough, said. He estimates that organic growers get $1.60 per pound for their berries.
The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA) has certified 40 farms throughout the state as organic, covering 1,286 acres, just a tiny portion of the state's total of 44,000 acres of wild blueberry fields. Most of the organic growers run small operations; only six have farms bigger than 50 acres.
"We've had some increased interest in certifying, including some of the big guys," MOFGA agricultural services director Dave Colson said in an email. The organic certification process takes three years without chemical inputs. Most of the big growers are not organic, although Yarborough said some are experimenting with converting some fields, and one, Merrill Blueberry Farm in Ellsworth, is the only organic certified processor. "But primarily increased interest in the process without a lot of growth, yet. Most want to see what happens this year."
This season so far? "It's pretty good,"said Nicolas Lindholm, who along with Ruth Fiske runs one of the bigger organic farms, Blue Hill Berry Co. They have 70 acres spread out over about 10 locations on the Blue Hill Peninsula. Lindholm started in the business with five acres, and has been steadily growing his business, successfully. Most of Blue Hill Berry Co. sales are fresh (about 80 percent), but they also ship a frozen product all over the country.
Lindholm said Yarborough's $1.60 per pound is a low figure, more like what a grower would get selling to a processor. On the fresh market, Lindholm is getting $6 a pint. He brought his first fresh wild blueberries to market a week ago, and had no problem selling out. "It's a pretty strong market," he said, but he attributes that to steadily building business - and direct relationships within the marketplace - over the last 20 years.
Not that it's a piece of cake.
"The industry as a whole is under great pressure, particularly facing extreme pressure from Canadian berries that I am certainly not immune to," he said.
Expanding the market for organic berries is key, Colson said, before other growers make that conversion to organic, because otherwise the organic side of the crop is likely to face the same kind of price drop that the big growers have seen.
The day before the competition at Fork Food Lab, David Yarborough took the group to Fields' Field organic wild blueberry farm in Dresden for an up-close look at the barrens. He said a lot of the chefs and food service representatives seemed more oriented toward fresh product, which in almost all cases are cultivated blueberries grown on high bushes. The leap to considering a frozen, and much smaller, berry is a big one. "I don't think universally they were all sold on it," Yarborough said. "But a lot of them did see the health attributes."
Sara Lawson, an operations and commercialization chef with the Applebee's culinary innovation team based in Los Angeles, said witnessing the way the blueberries grow wild - with a little help from farmers in terms of water, pollination and nutrients - reminded her of "almost like a fairy kind of magic."
"I found it really Zen," she said. "Peaceful and beautiful."
Her work is focused on helping cooks at nearly 2,000 Applebee's restaurants manage their time strategically. Translation, she's not a buyer. But as she sliced up a plump lobster tail for her dish in the competition, she said she could see how frozen wild blueberries could work for say, a bar drink.
As the event at Fork Food Lab was winding down, McBrady deemed it a success. "Just making that relationship and starting that conversation is a success."
"Beyond that, if one or two of them added it to their account? That would be amazing."
She said the Wild Blueberry Association of North America will definitely repeat the event next year, capitalizing on the momentum they'd created this July.
"We can't be one and done," she said. "That would be silly. If we create a buzz within the industry and we see this popping up on menus, we've just got to keep moving in that direction."

Full text: HIPPSBURG -- In a quiet tidal cove a few miles from Popham Beach, a team of biologists and fishermen are working to improve water quality and habitat by helping a popular delicacy gain a literal foothold in the muddy bottom.
The late-July sun was baking the air and mudflats as a team of workers dropped what looked like miniature concrete castles into the receding waters of "The Basin" area of the New Meadows River. Although nearly impossible to see with the naked eye, untold thousands of oyster larvae were tucked into the nooks and crannies of the concrete contraptions, waiting for transplant into their new tidal home.
Oyster farming is booming in the state as restaurants from Boothbay to Los Angeles put shellfish grown in the cold, clean water of coastal Maine on the menu. But this experimental 400-square-foot plot in The Basin isn't aimed at the commercial market, at least not directly. Instead, The Nature Conservancy and its partners are exploring ways to help restore or build up oyster populations growing on the bottom - rather than in floating cages or bags used by oyster aquaculturalists - in hopes of encouraging more natural spawning in the future.
"This is different in that it is meant to be more permanent on the bottom," said Jeremy Bell, aquatic habitat restoration manager with the Maine chapter of The Nature Conservancy, pointing to the heavy concrete "tiles" slated for The Basin floor. "And hopefully, as we learn the technique, you will get oyster populations growing and you'll get the habitat protection that comes with that reef."
The Nature Conservancy worked with the Phippsburg Shellfish Commission, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR) to line up the project. Located just offshore from a 10,000-acre Conservancy property known as the Basin Preserve, the plot is situated in a sheltered cove that has long drawn both commercial and recreational shellfish harvesters looking for oysters, clams and other edibles.
Eagles, osprey and gulls flew above on a recent afternoon as boaters - in small aluminum boats and high-priced cruisers - drifted through the cove roughly halfway down the peninsula best known for Popham Beach State Park. On the shoreline, about a half-dozen people worked to prepare the concrete "tiles" of oyster larvae while divers scouted out the best placement spots in the calm waters.
Dean Doyle, a fisherman who serves on the Phippsburg Shellfish Commission, said you can still find nice, native American oysters in parts of The Basin along with the non-native European oyster commonly found in Maine. But much of the basin's clams were lost to worm diggers a few years ago, a long-running competition that periodically erupts into tense waterfront exchanges and municipal meetings among those midcoast Mainers who work the mudflats.
Doyle said the Phippsburg Shellfish Commission supported The Nature Conservancy's proposal.
"I think it's a good idea," Doyle, who also volunteers with DMR's water-quality monitoring program. "This is the perfect area to put them. We used to have a lot here. ... Hopefully, it will work, and these will spawn and settle in the area. It can't hurt to try."
Oysters have long been a dietary staple of Maine residents, perhaps best illustrated by the massive shell middens left behind by Native American communities in places such as Damariscotta. And while oysters have always been popular elsewhere among some segments of the population, the bivalves are undergoing a renaissance in restaurants across the country, whether served raw on the half-shell or in some other fashion.
Maine's oyster aquaculture industry is capitalizing on their growing popularity.
Maine DMR reported that oyster farmers hauled in a record $5 million worth of oysters -- or roughly 2.1 million pounds -- in 2016. That is a fraction of the value of Maine's roughly $500 million lobster industry but represents a growing segment of a fishing industry that many fishermen and observers say has become too dependent on the official state crustacean. Oyster landings in Maine have increased 254 percent, and the harvest's value has grown about 300 percent since 2011, according to state records.
And while the Damariscotta River and other parts of the midcoast have long been known for their quality oysters, new oyster aquaculture leases are going out from southern Maine to Down East.
Bell said The Nature Conservancy doesn't ever plan to commercially harvest the oysters that he hopes will soon be populating that corner of The Basin, even though they are using the genetic strain of American oyster commonly used in aquaculture. If the population grew large enough years down the line, Bell said, he would be comfortable with locals harvesting some of the oysters on a sustainable basis.
But the real goal is a self-sustaining oyster population that can help improve the ecological health of The Basin and, perhaps, serve as a model for other areas around Maine.
Because oysters are filter-feeders, they are often regarded as a natural ally in the fight to improve water quality as they suck up microorganisms, sediments, nitrogen and nutrients from the water. Those activities help reduce sedimentation in the water column and encourage growth of other aquatic plants, such as eel grass. In turn, these provide food and shelter to other aquatic organisms, thereby helping with ecological diversity.
At The Basin, the team is deploying the roughly 2-foot-square tiles that look like something you might find in a tropical fish aquarium. Before arriving in Phippsburg, the tiles had been in a large tank filled with 500,000 oyster larvae. The idea is the concrete-and-rebar structures -- in addition to providing a platform for baby oysters -- will act like a coral reef, helping to rebuild the complex bottom habitat that provides shelter to smaller fish and other organisms that, in turn, feed larger predators. But Bell acknowledges that is just an idea.
"They tested very well down in Virginia in the Chesapeake Bay," Bell said. "We don't know how they are going to work in Maine."
The team also plans to test other methods of oyster cultivation in the hopes that one, or several, will prove successful at establishing a larger, self-sustaining oyster population and, in the process, improving water quality and habitat.
The larvae-laden tiles weren't even in the water, however, before the group came face-to-tiny face with one of the major challenges facing bottom-dwelling oysters, clams and other shellfish in southern Maine.
Almost on cue, small green crabs not much larger than a silver dollar began emerging from seemingly nowhere (but actually from the mud or water) and side-stepping their way toward the larvae tiles and piles of oyster shells. The invasive green crab has become a menacein recent years to clam and mollusk harvesters who are scrambling to find ways to stop, or at least slow, their spread because of their capacity to kill shellfish larvae.
Amanda Moeser, an oyster farmer who also leads The Nature Conservancy's oyster conservation programs in Maine and New Hampshire, and others devised a plan to enclose the tiles in plastic cages with mesh small enough to keep many green crabs at bay. Those caged tiles were later placed in water in The Basin deep enough for them to stay fully submerged and avoid entanglements with passing boats even at low tide.
Bell said the project will have to weather the winter ice-scraping and other challenges, but he was optimistic about the tiny oyster plot.
"We could potentially do this in other places," Bell said. "Hopefully, other groups or towns might get interested and try it."

Full text: THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS) are George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon.
After reading articles about Rockport's 18 Central in Zest and Down East magazines, we were eager to dine there. Chef Patrick Duffy and his wife Jessica have created a restaurant that is unique, with creative dishes and an ever-changing menu that keeps both locals and summer visitors flocking to this place. Be sure to get a reservation.
Our table overlooked Rockport Harbor, and every table was full on a Monday night, including the long bar near the entrance. Our server, Alexa, a young lady who aspires to be a professional photographer, has worked here since last November and was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. That was a good thing because Patrick's dishes are complicated.
Linda insisted on a single, shared appetizer (fried green tomatoes, $15). That turned out to be wise because portions are large. I did wish I'd had a chance to try the extensive raw bar menu, which includes oysters from six Maine suppliers and clams from New Meadows. Next time!
After reading about the scallop and pork belly entree in the magazines, I had to have it. Alexa confirmed that it is indeed very good. And boy, it sure was. Just imagine: grilled scallops, roasted pork belly, parsnip mashed potatoes, grilled radicchio, spring onion agradolce and a spicy mustard on the side.
With the first bite of scallop, I am in dining heaven. Then I hear Linda raving about her first bite of chicken, "Wow, Is that good!" Patrick's sauces are amazing and some take more than a day to prepare.
We stayed that night at 250 Main, a gorgeous new hotel on the east end of Rockland's great downtown. It has stunning views of the ocean from both the rooms and the rooftop deck. There are a lot of amenities from heated towel racks to afternoon wine and cheese gatherings.
A college-age young man, Joshua, carried our bags to our room and visited with us at the afternoon wine gathering. Every staffer here is friendly and smiling, and takes time to speak with you -- something we appreciate. Our room on the fifth floor offered a great view of the ocean, and we lingered the next morning before heading home.
While we were in Rockland, we enjoyed a fantastic lunch at Close to Home, a new sandwich shop opened by the owners of Home Kitchen Cafe. My El Cubano was superb.
250 Main is the new contemporary hotel in Rockland. One step in and I noticed the European feel. The large, open layout of the main lobby was filled with artwork. High ceilings featured old wooden boards next to corrugated steel sections. Fresh coffee awaits, and there are several tables where small gatherings meet and breakfast is served.
Our room featured modern lighting and sleek furniture offset by white walls. An entire wall of windows filled the room with light and looked out over the harbor. The elegant bathroom had modern fixtures, fluffy towels and an extra-large glass door shower. Yes, one feels pampered here.
There is a lot of art throughout the building, featuring Maine artists in various mediums. A pamphlet in the lobby detailed the artwork on each floor and a little bit about each artist.
Dinner at 18 Central that evening was superb. We had dined here a couple of years ago when it was Shepard's Pie. It is still a nice dining space with some tables overlooking the water. The open kitchen offers great views of the food being prepared. It always amazes me when you have a packed dining room and the chefs are very busy, but don't seem stressed out. I'm pretty sure I would be.
I knew what I wanted for an appetizer, and yes, I did have some convincing to do to get George to share one. But this version of fried green tomatoes was topped with fresh crabmeat. Sold. With green goddess dressing, herbs, microgreens and a splash of chili oil, this appetizer was elegant. It was big enough to split and still be able to enjoy our entrees.
As I glanced through the menu, I thought, "It would probably be wrong to order fried chicken in a restaurant like this." However, my gauge of a great restaurant is if they can take chicken and really elevate it. This dish proved that the chefs know exactly what they are doing.
The coating was crispy yet light, and the chicken was moist and tender. It was drizzled with a sesame cider vinaigrette. One bite and I was over the moon. This fried chicken dinner ($25) came with collards and heirloom grits. The collards had a smokey flavor (perhaps cooked with salt pork), and the grits had texture and a bit of spice.
Chef Patrick told us he grew up in Virginia. Yes, I thought, of course he has those southern flavors down. I was not wrong in ordering the chicken here, for it truly was the best fried chicken I have ever tasted.
We split the homemade strawberry rhubarb oatmeal crisp. It was served warm with a honey ricotta topping. It wasn't overly sweet and tasted like spring -- a great finish to a great dinner.

Full text: The second mild winter in a row means that Maine tidal flats will likely be overrun by large, ravenous invasive green crabs this summer.
That's bad news for the state's already weakened soft-shell clam industry. One green crab can consume 40 half-inch clams a day and will dig 6 inches to find clams to eat. In 2016, clam landings fell 21 percent, from 9.3 million to 7.3 million pounds, the lowest reported since 1991, according to the state Department of Marine Resources.
Some of the landings decline was undoubtedly a result of an unusual bloom of toxic algae that forced a monthlong shellfishing ban along about a third of Maine's coastline last fall, but researcher Sara Randall of the Downeast Institute in Beals notes that a review of landings in towns with traditionally high claim landings south of the Deer Isle-Stonington closure line found 19 out of 24 towns, or 79 percent, had harvested fewer clams.
For example, from 2015 to 2016, landings fell in Harpswell by 35 percent, Yarmouth by 87 percent and Scarborough by 21 percent. In Freeport, a town on the front line of the effort to combat the green crab invasion, landings decreased by 17 percent, despite efforts by municipal officials, clammers and researchers like Randall, among others, to use protective measures like nets and other tools to ward off the green crabs.
The mild winter may only make matters worse. Clammers had hoped for a cold winter, so the deep freeze and ice would kill off a lot of the crabs, allowing the clam seed still found in high numbers in Maine waters a chance to settle in the tidal flats and grow, forming those telltale tiny holes that tell clammers that a harvest awaits them under the mud.
But this winter, Freeport clammer Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association, saw green crabs active throughout the winter, with some even bearing eggs or in soft shells, which is a sign of recent molting. Neither of these usually happens in the cold of winter, which means there will be more crabs on the flats this year looking for dinner, and that many of those will be larger than in years past and thus able to eat more.
As clam harvests become more unpredictable, Coffin said the once thriving clamming culture is fading, and the infrastructure that brought clams to market slowly disappearing. Buyers are leaving the industry and restaurants are writing the summer favorite off their menus, unsure if they will be available on any given day.
"When I first started clamming in 1990, there were three wholesalers here in Freeport," Coffin said. "It is down to one now. He's getting up there in age, so we don't know how long that's going to last. There aren't as many of us clammers here either, with only 1,200 or so left of us in the state, and we're getting old, too, clamming less."
Clammers this year may yet see a good harvest. As the number of clammers decline, those who remain can harvest a bigger share of the smaller harvest. In 2017, they will be harvesting clams that made it from seed to juvenile status because of a cold winter in 2013-14 that killed off many green crabs. As a result, the clams were able to grow big enough, with thick enough shells, to survive predation and fill clammers' bags.
The clammers who remain hope to make a living off that population until the next deep freeze comes along.
But unlike in 2015, when scarcity drove prices up over $2 a pound for the first time, the value of Maine soft-shell clams fell 31.5 percent in 2016. In 2016, soft-shell clams sold for an average of $2.13 a pound, compared to $2.46 a pound in 2015. But that's still more than clammers dreamed of just 10 years ago, when clams sold for an average of $1.43 a pound, and more than enough to keep some clammers coming back for more.
And holding their breath for another cold winter.
The scientist who is leading efforts to find a way to save the iconic industry believes there must be a better way.
"Hope is not a sustainable long-term management plan," said Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at University of Maine at Machias. "I believe the answer lies in aquaculture."
While clammers like Coffin embrace Beal's scientific findings, others denounce the suggestion that they turn to farming clams in small plots of carefully protected flats, possibly leased from the landowners who control access to the upper tidal flats, to keep the industry alive. The old ways still work for them, they say. They question his science and his motives, often in raised voices at local shellfish commission meetings.
But Coffin has seen the empty netted boxes that Beal has built on Freeport flats once thought dead yield thousands of clams in the protected silt come fall. High tide brings the floating clam larvae to the flats. The microscopic seed can pass through the netting-- which is just large enough to let the clams pass through but small enough to keep the crabs out -- to settle in the box. The flats around the box, left unprotected, are empty of clams come fall.
There have been some kinks. Beal has had to put bottoms on the boxes to prevent milky ribbon worms from coming up through the mud from below to eat the baby clams. Not every spot has been as productive as others, although the silt inside the boxes has always yielded far more clams than outside. And the boxes are still too small to yield a commercially profitable crop, although he plans to test larger boxes this summer.
But the evidence was more than enough to persuade Coffin that this is the future of his industry. The ocean temperature is warming, faster in the Gulf of Maine than almost anywhere else in the world, and deep-freeze winters are likely to become rarer in the future, he said. But it will be a difficult change for an industry that has remained essentially unchanged for generations, Coffin said.
Many shellfish commissions that control licensing on the flats are made up of clammers who still cling to the old ways, he said. The riparian landowners who control access to the upper tidal area where would-be farmers could set up protective boxes like the ones Beal uses for research purposes want to keep their ocean views free of farming plots, and the farmers who would tend them.
"The working waterfront is disappearing," Coffin said. "If we can't adapt to what's coming, what's already happened, clamming in Maine will disappear. It may be that a clam digger doesn't have a future, but a clam farmer might. But we can't do it alone. People look out at the ocean and see the blue and the sunsets and think it's beautiful, but they don't see the devastation. They may not see it, but I can. It's decision time."

Full text: argaret Morris' mother, like a million mothers before her, used to come home with those Clinique giveaways, tester-sized packages of makeup and skin-smoothing agents in pale green tubes. The name sounded like they were fresh off the Concorde from Paris, although in reality, Clinique products were created and made by an American company, Estée Lauder. These cleverly marketed potions were full of promises for blooming complexions, and as a teenager in Auburn, Morris did her fair share of browsing beauty products like them at the mall.
These days though, Morris buys Maine honey by the five-gallon jug, orders beeswax and shea butter online and mixes up recipes for skin care products in her own kitchen in Brunswick. She sells her line, Five Islands Body Co, at farmers markets, local boutiques, health food stores and online using Shopify's services. Morris is one of a growing number of Mainers who have gone into the skin care business in recent years, making use of Maine ingredients and capitalizing on a local aesthetic that is far more Ivory Girl than Parisian sophisticate. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone in this crowd making blue eye shadow; the Maine-made product is more typically about enhancing an already natural look with everything from rosa rugosa to seaweed.
"There's this whole aura surrounding the Maine-made beauty products," said Tammy Knight, who runs the state's Maine Made program, a marketing effort run through the Department of Economic and Community Development, and who ushered Morris into its fold of about 2,100 "makers" a few months ago. "There's this handcrafted element, that somebody is actually touching it and doing the mixing and the testing. It evokes the state. It is clean and it is pure."
Newcomers like Morris are part of today's local movement, but they're following in some big, even giant, footsteps. Maine is where Tom and Kate Chappell experimented with Tom's of Maine toothpaste and such in the 1970s and where Roxanne Quimby and Burt Shavitz started the mega-successful, natural skincare company Burt's Bees in the 1980s. Then there is Deb Soule's Avena Botanicals, whose organic herbal remedies include consumables like elixirs and teas but also salves and skin creams such as Fairy Flower Creme, a stalwart in many beauty regimes for 28 years. Going back even further? In 1934, beauty magnate Elizabeth Arden opened the Maine Chance Spa in Mount Vernon;, which was operational until 1970.
Those companies do have an influence in today's new product makers.
"Obviously, Burt's Bees was a magical formula," said Gabrielle "Gabs" Melchionda of Mad Gabs, a Yarmouth-based maker of natural and organic lip, body and foot balms. "She (Quimby) paved the way for people like me." (In the department of small world Maine, Melchionda used to be married to one of the Chappell's sons.) Claire Weinberg of Dulse & Rugosa, a botanicals company that got its start in 2012 on Gotts Island off Mount Desert Island, said Maine's skin and personal care magnates served as an inspiration for the "big idea" that brought Dulse & Rugosa into existence. So did legendary Maine homesteaders Helen and Scott Nearing. Weinberg and her daughter (and business partner's) desire to live and work on Gotts Island mirrored the Nearing's commitment to place, she said. But, she said, inspiration only goes so far in practical terms.
"I knew there were great companies out there, but I was also clueless about business," Weinberg said, laughing. "We have made a lot of mistakes."
For Morris, the inspiration to open a business was born of frustration with one of those famed Maine companies about six years ago. She'd been using a body butter product made by Burt's Bees, which is now owned by the Clorox Company and run out of Durham, North Carolina, and liked it, but when she went to buy more of it, something seemed different. "The formula seemed to have changed drastically," she said. The fragrance was "funky." She shopped around. "I just couldn't find something that didn't have perfume or synthetic ingredients."
Morris already had a do-it-yourself impulse, and she went looking for recipes. In 2011, while her infant daughter (now 6) was napping, Morris would be melting ingredients, sliding them into the fridge to firm them up and testing them on herself. Soon Morris was making not just body butter she could use on her baby, but lip balms and then lotions and hand creams, made with essential oils instead of perfumes. She'd pass on extra to friends and family. Positive feedback encouraged her to start selling her line in 2015. Now, with her Maine Made certification, she's poised for growth.
That's not always an obvious path, and it rarely leads to the kind of payouts Quimby or the Chappells got when they sold their companies to conglomerates (Quimby reportedly more than $300 million, Chappell, about $100 million). Melchionda said she operated "on a shoestring" for 25 years and only moved past being a cottage industry about three years ago, when her kids were a little older (they're 13 and 17).
"I never stopped working, but I never pushed the way I would have had I not had kids," she said.
Initially, her lip balm making was an offshoot of a "hippie" lifestyle, she said, almost a hobby for a good four years. Then in 1997, QVC, the television shopping channel, came to Maine looking for companies to promote. Mad Gabs was one of them. Still, many of her sales involved shoe leather and time in the car, driving to natural food stores all over Maine.
For the last two years she and her staff have been delivering to Hannafords all over the region, 87 in all. They just made the grade to get into the warehouse.
"You have to earn your chops," Melchionda said.
As a longtime Maine maker, she says she tries to be helpful to newcomers in the beauty business. Gaining entry to the business has never been easier -- throwing up a website and finding someone to print labels is a snap. Sustaining a business is a lot harder.
"I have seen so many people come and go in the last 10 years," she said. "Honestly, it takes a long time to make it happen."
Though she's always worked with organic and natural ingredients, her packaging is far less homespun than say, the classic Burt's Bees look. "They have stayed true to the yellow and tan thing," Melchionda said. "Kind of gender neutral. I can't be that calm with my packaging."
Like say, her Huckleberry Bear Smooch Lip Balm. It's made with organic extra-virgin olive oil, organic beeswax, Vitamin E and organic flavor. But nothing about it screams homespun or handmade or "farm" or for that matter, "Maine." She ships her products in plant-based "peanuts" and recycled newspapers.
She's not tapping into that crafty, Maine aesthetic like many of the others, but that may be a product of practicality.
"It is hard to make money selling three of this and five of that," she said. "Mass-produced gets a bad rap, but that is when you make money." She places Mad Gabs in an in-between zone she dubs "affordable organics."
The company has dabbled in shimmers and glosses, but that's as close as she's gotten to makeup. "Our line was always to encourage natural beauty and health in women and girls," Melchionda said. "I have no idea how you make mascara. I am not interested in that."
Maine Revenue Services doesn't track beauty-related businesses, so it's difficult to quantify exactly how many new makers are producing Maine-made beauty and skincare products. But the list includes an oyster farmer in Scarborough and a mother in Waldoboro, whose success with an item inspired by the 2016 presidential election helped fund a bricks and mortar store.
What they have in common, besides Maine and typically gender (women dominate this business) is that their entrepreneurship stemmed, as Morris' did, from a need to address a very specific personal need, whether for themselves or a family member. And as that need was met, a financial imperative kicked in; the way they helped themselves could also be a way to help cement a future in Maine.
For Claire Weinberg, it was about hair. Specifically, dandruff. She is not shy about admitting she had it. Her itchy scalp started in high school and hardly ever let up, despite medicated shampoos and a stash of shampoos and conditioners that quite clearly implicated her as a heavy consumer, the kind who would wash her hair every day and go through seven (plastic) bottles a month. "I was a hair product junkie," Weinberg said.
She was teaching and so was her daughter Carly, a recent College of the Atlantic graduate. Both of them were eager to spend more time on Gotts Island near Bass Harbor, where they were the only year-round residents. They tried farming, like the Nearings, but even in the summer there weren't enough other people around to sustain a living. Then one day Claire came home and found Carly cooking up seaweed in the kitchen; she was working on a shampoo that might help her mother get off the product treadmill.
That was 2012. Their company, Dulse & Rugosa, is best known for its shampoo bars (hard, round and cured for a month). The constants in their various products, which include a "sunburn survival" kit, tend to be rosa rugosa and seaweeds, including sugar kelp and oarweed, harvested from Gotts Island by Carly, who is a licensed harvester. and the Weinbergs are at what feels like a turning point (at presstime, Claire Weinberg had her fingers crossed that "Marie Claire" would be mentioning, or even, endorsing, one of Dulse & Rugosa's products in its June issue). To sell, she roves farmers markets in Maine and as far south as Boston, and they continue to expand their product line. But she hasn't quit her part-time teaching job yet and questions, can they make a go of it full time?
"I'm wondering, is doing these other things actually holding me back?" Weinberg said.
Amanda Nelson of Long Winter Soap Company has been in the skincare business for a decade now - her inspiration was her oldest daughter's cradle cap, which needed the gentlest of soaps - cooking up soap and lip balms and skin cream at her home in Waldoboro, in "small batches from sustainably-obtained ingredients," and selling them first on Etsy and then on Shopify.
"With this economy, you have to kind of make your own job," Nelson said. "Because there are no jobs here."
But this month she made a big move, into her first brick-and-mortar store in downtown Waldoboro. The morning after the debate where Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a "nasty woman," Nelson and her husband, Lucas McNelly, dreamed up a new lip balm flavor, "Nasty Woman." (It's flavored with coffee and walnut, in case you wondered.) The Maine Democrats put in an order immediately and the lip balm went viral. Nelson and McNelly sold about 18,000 of them, Nelson said, and helped fund the new store. "It made it so we didn't have to borrow anything."
Nelson's soaps are seriously striking, with artful and unexpected designs. She packages them in muslin bags and tests "on friends, not animals" She uses essential oils. "I stay away from the ones that aren't sustainably harvested," Nelson said. That includes sandlewood ("crazy over-harvested.") But she does use many ingredients that come from far away, including palm oil, which is criticized by many environmental groups because rainforests and other critical habitats are often cleared to produce it; she says hers is certified as sustainably harvested.
Herein lies an interesting issue with many Maine-made beauty products. Just because they're handcrafted in Maine doesn't mean they're made with ingredients sourced from Maine. For example, Nelson uses Dead Sea salts, not Maine salt.
"The Maine sea salt is so expensive right now. It (her product) would have to be at a crazy price point."
Weinberg doesn't use Maine sea salt either, and for the same reason, but something like Dulse & Rugosa's "Sinus Relief" smelling salts includes calendula and bachelor button flower petals grown on Gott's Island. That sourcing is key to her marketing, as is her effort to get to zero waste with packaging (mostly paper and glass, except for the lip balms).
"The great thing about skin care is, everybody has skin," Weinberg said. "And hey, instead of buying something that has maybe come from China and you don't know where the ingredients came from, you can buy it from a Maine farm."
About 80 percent of the ingredients in Deb Soule's Avena Botanicals are grown in Maine on Avena's organic and biodynamic farm. Avena grows its herbs outdoors on about 3 acres, Soule said, and uses a greenhouse to start about 5,000 seedlings.
The ingredients she does have to source from away, including olive, coconut and almond oils, are all organic. It has gotten easier to find those organic ingredients in the last 13 or so years, she said. That sourcing, either from Maine or through organic and ethical producers, is important to Soule.
"The Maine Made label is a wonderful label," Soule said. "But it can be a little confusing to people if they are products that are being made in Maine, but they are getting many of the ingredients from elsewhere."
Her own growth has been slow and steady. If she wants to make, say, a face cream with rose petals as a key ingredient, she has to cultivate the roses. Her hedgerow of rosa rugosa, the only biodynamically grown rugosa in the country, she said, last year yielded 40 pounds of rose petals. That's petals, those nearly weightless things, not hips or flowers.
"I don't have a business or a marketing department," Soule said. "I am an herbalist and an herb farmer."
Another farmer with a sideline in the skincare business is Abigail Carroll, whose oyster farm in Scarborough, Nonesuch, is shared with her line of beauty products, Nonesuch Skin Care. The oyster farm came first and cultivating oysters in chilly waters motivated her experiments with Maine ingredients, including seaweed. She'd been a day trader in Paris, living a, well, Parisian life, and suddenly she said, she'd acquired "these lobsterman hands."
"Some days I couldn't wash my hair because my hands were so cracked and bleeding," she said. "I was really worried about the damage I was getting."
But as rough as the elements were on her skin, some of them seemed to hold promise of a fix. "If you just pick up seaweed and rub it on your hands you will see a difference," she said. "It will put this nice little film of a protector on your hands."
Nonesuch Skin Care has had to be sidelined sporadically during the last few years - the oyster farm is the priority - but she's made marketing inroads in unexpected ways. When she brought oysters to an event in New York hosted by author and oyster expert Rowan Jacobson, she brought samples of her hand salve. Connections have led to high-end shops, like the New York Yacht Club's store in Newport, Rhode Island, or Clutch, a boutique in Nantucket.
"I'm not trying to do what Tom's of Maine or Burt's Bees does," Carroll said. "We are a little more upscale."
Pricewise, Nonesuch products tend to be comparable to say, Kiehl's instead of Burt's Bees or Five Islands. For example, that Maine-harvested sea salt that makers like Morris, Nelson and the Weinbergs shy away from because of its cost? Carroll uses it exclusively in her body scrub ($45).
"We want to make beautiful products, whether they be oysters or skincare products, that have a little smattering of luxury but are really all about the nature, that tell a bigger story about the Maine coast."
Part of what has kept her pace slow and deliberate is a desire to make good choices, sustainability wise, in packaging. "We want our products to really reflect our values as farmers, because our interests as farmers are really tied to the environment."
She's working on a product now that will incorporate oyster shells, cooking ingredients in her kitchen and testing on friends ("Maine divas" she jokes). Unlike some of the other do-it-yourself skincare makers, she's had help from consultants with deep expertise to help her iron out the kinks. One is Kirsten Marsh, a friend from graduate school who spent much of her career working in the cosmetics business in Paris.
"She worked in New York and Paris and London," Carroll said. "She worked for everybody. She started at Clinique."
Clinique again; in the beauty world, the same names tend to resurface. But these Maine entrepreneurs are hoping to make an impact with a whole new set of names.

Full text: Mary Burr points at the spinach sprouting in the high tunnel at the farm she owns with her husband, Bob Burr, on Corson Road in Mercer on Thursday afternoon.
"We'll harvest this on Saturday morning to serve at dinner," she said.
The in-season vegetables will be served at the couple's farm-to-table restaurant, 122 Corson, which sits only about 400 feet from the high tunnels.
The restaurant, which first opened its doors last June, is starting its second season Saturday. The hyperlocal dining experience is the natural evolution of the couple's commitment to good food and local products, Mary said.
"We just wanted to have a place that we would be happy to go to," she said. "We're firm believers of you are what you eat."
The restaurant is part of a growing local food movement in the Skowhegan area, which Kristina Cannon would consider a "local agricultural food hub."
Cannon is the executive director of Main Street Skowhegan, a nonprofit started in 2005 to revitalize the area.
Local agriculture is "certainly one of the most important assets that we have currently," she said. The movement began with the opening of the Somerset Grist Mill, co-owned by Amber Lambke, and gained momentum with the Pickup Community Supported Agriculture food-shares program and a year-round farmers market.
"People from around the state are starting to notice that we have this great local food economy," Cannon said.
The Burrs first got into the business of farming at the local farmers market, but they were growing their own food well before they decided to take it to market.
Mary, 63, grew up in Brisbane, Australia, where her family raised horses and cattle. She met Bob, 66, who is from Eastport, after he won a scholarship to study in the country for a year. When they married in 1973 and Mary moved to Maine, they decided to grow their own food with a large garden.
"That became our way of eating, that traditional Maine style of making our own food," Mary said.
While Bob worked as the president and CEO of Pride Manufacturing, Mary raised a flock of Dorset sheep and grew hay commercially for 35 years.
When he retired, the couple bought a high tunnel in which to grow vegetables using the method designed by Eliot Coleman, who has written books on organic farming and growing vegetables year-round.
They found that they produced more than they could eat, Mary said, so they started Blue Ribbon Farm and joined the Skowhegan Farmers Market. Later, they put up a second high tunnel and added a few acres outside.
"We've never thought of the farm as hard work," she said. "Growing our own food has always been a pleasure."
When the Somerset Grist Mill was started, they began thinking about what demand wasn't being met. A number of people were making bread, so the Burrs went to Italy and learned how to make pasta, which began their Pasta Fresca business.
Bob's understanding of business and finance is what has kept the farm businesses from facing the challenges so many others in agriculture face, Mary said. Any market they chose to enter, Bob would study for at least 12 months, she said.
After taking on a number of commercial ventures, the couple is focusing on "relaxing" with 122 Corson.
"We've already made our living, so we don't have the strain on us that other people have," Mary said.
The restaurant broke even in its first year, making a small profit, which is uncommon in the industry, Mary said.
Meanwhile, the Burrs have decided "to start peeling some of the layers back a bit." The pasta machines are up for sale, and the Burrs are attending fewer farmers markets as they try to simplify for the future.
The restaurant is the first building on their property that sits near the top of a hill on Corson Road, about two miles from U.S. Route 2.
Most people find out about 122 Corson by word of mouth, Mary said. People from out of state who own camps in the area come for dinner, as well as locals who are looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion.
The property features beautiful mountain views of muted shades of purple and blue. In the center of the vista is Mount Blue, to the left Sugarloaf and Saddleback mountains, and to the right, on a clear day Mary said, Mount Washington in New Hampshire is visible.
The view also keeps the Burrs going through hard days of farm work. "You've got to look up," Mary said.
Bob has eaten in "thousands" of restaurants around the world while working, Mary said, so he had an idea of what to focus on when starting the business.
"We're both very particular in what we eat and where we eat," she said.
Their focus was simple: healthy food, a welcoming atmosphere, attentive but noninvasive servers and happy staff.
The restaurant is open one to two days each week, seats 20 people and is usually full, Mary said.
She encourages everyone to arrive early for their reservation so they can mingle and make friends.
"We wanted to foster the community aspect of it," she said.
The fixed menu, which is prepared by house chef Ed Lamarre, includes an appetizer, salad, entree, dessert, and tea or coffee and ranges from $60 to $65 per person. It changes each week with what's blooming in the garden.
What the Burrs don't grow themselves in their two high tunnels and quarter-acre vegetable plot, they get from local farmers.
The seafood is from Mill Cove Lobster Pound in Boothbay Harbor and Maine Shellfish in Ellsworth; the meat comes from Caldwell Family Farm in Turner; some root vegetables come from Moodytown Gardens; the apples come from Cayford's Apple Orchard; and the cheese Mary offers to people while they're waiting is sourced from Crooked Face Creamery in Norridgewock and Kennebec Creamery in Sidney.
The Burrs hired locals to build the restaurant, as well. Mike Smiley, of New Sharon, built the timber frame, and John Dingley, of Industry, worked as the carpenter.
While the couple never thought they would open a restaurant, the venture has given them an opportunity to provide support to the local agriculture network they met while working the farmers market, Mary said.
"The quality is there and that's what makes the difference for the people who eat here. They can taste the freshness," Mary said. "The freshness and the flavor is so superior."
Sourcing all of their food locally isn't really difficult, she said, because that's what they're focused on. If they were just focused on the profit margin, it might be different.
"We wanted to be able to serve people food that is the way we eat," Mary said.
According to Cannon of Main Street Skowhegan, 122 Corson is also an "important asset" for the region because it provides a unique experience that people are looking for, drawing visitors to the area.
"Visitors are looking for authentic and local experiences, and that's exactly what 122 Corson offers," she said.
It's also something that's important to locals.
When the strategic planning committee for Skowhegan surveyed 500 people in the community, they said that the local food movement is what they're most proud of and what they would like to see expand.
"Businesses like 122 Corson ... are all important to the local region and, ultimately, to the Skowhegan brand," Cannon said.

Full text: Maine Cap N' Stem is growing iits business of selling kits to grow mushrooms for home growers and commercial operations from a warehouse in Gardiner.
GARDINER -- At some point in building Maine Cap N' Stem, it became clear the original plan wasn't going to work.
Three partners -- Mark Robinson, Erik Lomen and Christopher Campbell -- had come together to grow organic gourmet mushrooms, but it was just too much.
"Once you get going," Robinson said, "You can't stop. If we don't produce right now, we are screwed in two months."
Growing mushrooms, it turns out, is about a 20-step process that generally can be split into two parts. The first part is developing the growing material and inoculating it with the kind of mushrooms you want to grow. The second part is the fruiting stage when mushrooms start to grow, and all the steps needed to get them to market. Completing both halves of the equation leads to 90-hour workweeks and few breaks.
"We got to the point where we wanted to buy the blocks. We wanted certified organic substrate," he said. "That way, we could be happy and have weekends."
They couldn't find anything they liked, and that's when the light bulb switched on: They could make it themselves and move into an underserved niche and stake their claim there.
They gutted their business plan and built a new one from the ground up as a wholesaler of mushroom blocks to growers.
Maine Cap N' Stem focuses on wood-loving mushrooms -- shiitake, chestnut, oyster and lion's mane -- for which it makes a red oak sawdust-based sterile substrate into which they introduce spawn. The mixture is sealed into specially made plastic bags and left to incubate in a temperature-controlled environment.
The process is about understanding how mushrooms grow and controlling it so the packs don't fruit before they should.
That decision triggered others, including relocating outside the Portland region where high demand for space generally means high rent.
The 3,000-square-foot facility in Westbrook was suitable when they were growing mushrooms for the retail market, but for a wholesale facility where proximity to customers isn't a priority, it wasn't going to work.
When they looked for other commercial spaces a little more than a year ago, Gardiner popped up on the radar, with a former mill space off Brunswick Avenue.
"This move is probably the smartest business move that we have made," Robinson said, standing in the company's incubation room Friday as workers filled customer orders.
For Gardiner's part, finding Maine Cap N' Stem was a happy accident.
Patrick Wright, executive director of Gardiner Main Street and economic development coordinator for the city of Gardiner, had been looking at a building in downtown Gardiner and mentioned they were looking for warehouse space in central Maine.
"We weren't explicitly seeking them out," Wright said. "They recognized quickly we are a community and area seeking that kind of economic development."
In an era of increasing consolidation in the food sector, Wright said, the local foods movement -- which is one of Gardiner's economic engines -- is a bright spot where entrepreneurs can reclaim a part of food production.
"It takes a sharp entrepreneur to see it and to execute it," he said. "What I also think is really smart -- and I respect them for it -- is they are letting their sales growth lead their investment growth."
Their hands have been on everything they do.
"We do most of our own fabrication," Robinson said. "The equipment that we use is not available on the open market."
That means a lot of trial and error in building things such as the racks where the incubation occurs. Through a happy accident, they found the bags do better if they are spaced about a hand's width apart. The incubating bags put off heat and the space allows the heat to disperse.
"Sometimes you are building something 17 times, but you get what you want," he said.
At first, the partners thought they would build their market in the Northeast, reaching west to New York state and south to New Jersey, Lomen said.
Before long, word spread and Maine Cap N' Stem started fielding orders from as far away as Montana, Colorado and Texas.
Right now, Lomen said, about half their product goes to New England and neighboring states, and half goes elsewhere. And that, he said, is good for the local economy because it draws in new money.
"You think of the local food movement as farm-to-table being within a 30-mile radius," Wright said. "The local food movement in Montana is feeding the local food movement in Maine. That speaks not to a fad but a true economic trend."
The company's growth potential is strong.
The West Coast is filled with people, many of Asian descent, for whom mushrooms are a staple in their culinary tradition.
The East Coast is catching up and moving beyond the traditional white mushrooms that supermarkets regularly stock in the produce section.
"Everybody likes them, but they don't know where they come from," Robinson said. "This is where the specialty ones come from."
The innovation and the trial and error haven't stopped.
The building they occupy has space for expansion, and that will accommodate their immediate plan to scale up the operation, adding more product and more workers, and helping farmers to reach their capacity. They also want to build retail sales for grow-at-home customers.
With the help of grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Maine Technology Institute, they are exploring developing other strains of shiitake mushrooms to see how they interact with their style of substrate. Some customers prefer larger mushrooms; others prefer smaller. Lomen said half a billion strains can exist on a single mushroom cap.
"There is not a lot of information on cultivation that is not convoluted," he said.
They are considering retailing blocks for home growers, and they are thinking about other things they can do with their indoor farm.
It could be something like vegetable pack starts, Robinson said.
"We have a partner (Campbell) who always brings up crickets," Lomen said.
"We have no interest in that," Robinson said.
"Well, maybe," Lomen said.
"OK, we have very little interest in that," Robinson said. "I just don't want to step into a room with 700 million crickets in it. It creeps me out."

Full text: The budget that President Donald Trump proposed Thursday would have serious consequences across Maine, disrupting scientific research and social services, and affecting everyone from unemployed residents to those who rely on the sea to earn their living.
If approved by Congress, the 52-page plan would strip federal dollars from programs that provide heating oil and meals to low-income Mainers, legal aid to indigent citizens, and funding for homeless services. It would stop federal funds from flowing to Maine Public's television and radio outlets, the University of Maine's Sea Grant research program and research efforts at the Wells Reserve at Laudholm, which could end up closing.
The budget outline was subjected quickly to withering bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill.
"I have a hard time seeing how eliminating heating assistance, cutting medical research and ending economic development funding do little more than harm people families and businesses across Maine," said independent Sen. Angus King in a statement. "To me this doesn't seem like a serious attempt to offer a reasonable, cost-cutting budget -- and, sadly, it's hardworking, middle-class folks throughout the state who would bear the brunt of it all."
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said there "a number of serious problems" with the budget and that it will be "subject to significant revision by Congress." First District Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, declared it "dead on arrival." Second District Rep. Bruce Poliquin, a Republican, praised Trump for increasing funding for veterans and national security but said he had concerns about many of the cuts.
"The Trump budget is really a disaster from our perspective, and nothing more than a down payment on tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else," said Garrett Martin, executive director of the Maine Center for Economic Policy. "For Maine families and communities, this budget is a step back in terms of helping communities thrive and create opportunity."
The president's budget contains some potential benefits for Mainers, including increased funding for veterans' services and opioid treatment and recovery, as well as funding to restart work on a long-stalled federal nuclear waste depository in Nevada, which would create a final resting place for the spent fuel stranded at the former Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset. As well, most of the proposed cuts in Trump's budget are intended to fund a massive expansion of the military budget, which could benefit Maine's defense contractors.
Here are some effects the Trump budget could have in Maine:
The Environmental Protection Agency faces the largest cut in the entire budget -- 31 percent and a staff reduction of 3,200 -- which environmentalists say would devastate environmental protection in Maine.
The cuts include nearly a third to state grant programs that help clean up abandoned industrial sites, and protect air and water quality, and the elimination of grants to help Maine and other states mitigate radon, conduct beach water quality tests and buy cleaner school buses. The cuts also would affect the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, which receives more than 20 percent of its funding from the EPA, most of it to support clean air and clean water programs.
The cuts were foreshadowed in a preliminary budget plan leaked last month. Collns, King and Pingree all condemned a 30 percent cut to the so-called "brownfield" program, which has helped Maine towns clean up old mill and industrial sites so they could be redeveloped. The official budget document doesn't mention the program by name, but it appears to have been among the "more than 50 EPA programs" it promises to eliminate in order "to focus on its highest national priorities."
"We thought there was a slight chance that some of the cuts would be restored, but instead they cut even deeper," said Pete Didisheim, advocacy director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. "This is really a slash-and-burn budget. It's about as bad as we could possibly have imagined."
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency's Sea Grant program would disappear. The program has funded groundbreaking work on how to monitor juvenile lobster populations so researchers can better predict future health of the stock; assisted mussel, scallop and kelp farmers with research and methodological expertise; developed organic certification guidelines for sea vegetable growers; and helped monitor and contain bacteria and other marine pests that plague shellfish growers and harvesters.
Sea Grant researchers created the Fishermen's Forum -- the industry's premier event -- in 1976, and also helped found the Portland Fish Exchange and the university's Lobster Institute, which researches issues of concern to the industry. The Sea Grant funding also helped pay for the removal of dams and restoration of fish habitat in the Penobscot River watershed, and now provides $600,000 a year to improve road crossings and culverts there.
"Communities really care about this, because it's allowing them to prepare better and make their roads better before a storm happens, to help reduce flooding," said Kate Dempsey, state director for the Nature Conservancy's Maine chapter, which is a Sea Grant partner.
The budget also would eliminate coastal and marine management programs, which include the nation's 29 National Estuarine Research Reserves. One of those -- the Wells Reserve at Laudholm -- is in Maine and another, the Great Bay Estuarine Reserve, is just over the border in New Hampshire.
The budget would eliminate funding for the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which provides a wide range of money for Maine cities and towns, and has called for the elimination of "a number of lower priority programs" at the department, including the HOME Investment Partnership Program.
Community Development Block Grants and HOME funding have helped Portland address the needs of homeless people and improve housing and economic opportunities in low-income neighborhoods, said Mary David, the city's housing and community development director.
Last year Portland received $1.7 million in CDBG funds and $800,000 from HOME. Maine's largest city spends about 45 percent of its CDBG budget on social services, including $150,000 for community policing. Programs that have been recommended for funding next year include food pantries, homeless shelters, mental health services, case work, child care subsidies for low-income single parents and a new program that would offer jobs to panhandlers. The city anticipates spending $807,000 on development activities, such as replacing sidewalks, workforce training for people facing barriers to employment, and other infrastructure programs.
Mark Swann, director of the Portland nonprofit Preble Street, which operates a day shelter and soup kitchen, said the elimination of CDBG would make it more difficult for nonprofits that serve the needy to remain open. "Our existence is pretty fragile," he said. "CDBG is one of the only (ways) we're getting support for some of the basic emergency services we provide."
The Low Income Heating Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, provides heating assistance to about 45,000 Mainers, and it would be gone under Trump's budget.
The budget document describes LIHEAP as "a lower-impact program" that is "unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes." The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services program is administered in Maine by the Maine Housing Authority.
The program is particularly important in Maine, which relies heavily on oil for home heating. A family of four with an income under $47,350 is eligible for assistance.
The budget would eliminate the Legal Services Corp., a Nixon-era agency that provides funding for legal aid agencies that help the poor take grievances to court.
In Maine, the agency provides $1.4 million a year to Pine Tree Legal Assistance, a 50-year-old legal aid agency that represents poor Mainers in 4,500 cases a year. "That funding represents over half our budget for general legal services, and that's especially important in rural Maine, because we have fewer funding sources in rural counties," said Pine Tree's executive director, Nan Heald.
A volunteer for Pine Tree, Tom Cox, made national news after exposing the "robo-signing" scandal among sub-prime mortgage lenders. In its early years, Pine Tree brought young legal fellows from out of state, including a young Virginia lawyer named Angus King and attorney Tom Tureen, who would settle the 1980 Indian land claims settlement with the state, transforming the rights of tribal people in the eastern United States.
If Legal Services Corp. were eliminated, Heald said, Pine Tree wouldn't close but would likely have to shutter some of its six offices scattered across the state.
The budget would cut the U.S. Department of Agriculture by 21 percent. John Bott, spokesman for Maine's agriculture commissioner, Walt Whitcomb, said the commissioner was not available to comment on what effect the cuts could have in Maine.
The USDA regularly gives grants to Maine farms and farm-related businesses. The farm conservation group Maine Farmland Trust, which has protected 40,000 acres of Maine farmland, also provides services to farms that are aided by USDA grants. Last fall, the USDA announced to a grant to the trust to help its Farming for Wholesale program, which helps farmers find wholesale markets for their goods. For smaller-scale farmers, finding a place in this bigger marketplace can be one of their biggest challenges.
"We are very concerned about any proposed cuts to the USDA budget which could directly impact the availability of programs and services that many of Maine's farmers rely on for technical assistance and financing support," said Amanda Beal, president of the Belfast-based trust.
Among those programs are those implemented by the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, which gives technical support to farms across Maine in areas as diverse as soil and energy usage. The Maine office of the USDA's Farm Service Agency works on everything from disaster and flood relief to helping dairy farmers with protections on milk pricing.
Trump's budget would cut $9.2 billion, or 13.5 percent, from the Department of Education budget, reducing or eliminating grants for teacher training, after-school programs and aid to low-income and first-generation college students. It would add $1.4 billion for school choice programs, including charter schools, private-school vouchers and other alternatives to public schools.
Maine gets almost $700 million from the Department of Education every year. Most of it is for grants to help students pay for higher education: $409 million for federal direct student loan program, $104 million in Pell grants and $8.3 million in federal work-study grants.
Maine's federal DOE grants for kindergarten-through-grade 12 programs include $58.6 million for special education, $53.6 million for Title I funds for disadvantaged youth, $15.8 million in vocational rehabilitation and $10.7 million for effective instruction.
Nationwide, federal funds pay for 8 percent of elementary and secondary education; the rest is funded by the state. In addition to DOE, federal education funds come from the Department of Health and Human Services' Head Start program and the Department of Agriculture's School Lunch program. Maine gets about $13 million in Head Start funds and more than $45 million for various child nutrition programs.
By contrast, Maine's charter schools could benefit from the increase in federal funding available. So far, three charter schools in Maine have received a total of about $1 million in federal funds, in the form of grants to develop performance-based education plans, or technology grants.
Trump is proposing to dismantle the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, which together provided more than $2.8 million in Maine last year.
The NEH awarded $1.65 million to Maine institutions in 2016 through the Maine Humanities Council, which relies on the NEH for 73 percent of its budget, said executive director Hayden Anderson.
Recent NEH-funded projects include the council's $145,000 14th Amendment project, which last year challenged artists and humanities organizations to create work relating to the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which addresses equal protection. It granted the Maine State Museum $275,000 to digitize 100,000 pages of historic Maine newspapers.
Another $300,000 is helping the Maine Historical Society install a solar energy system at a warehouse storage facility that it jointly operates with the Portland Public Library. Since 2013, the NEH has given the University of Maine $339,400 to digitize an unpublished Penobscot language dictionary, create a revised and expanded database, and prepare a web-based and print dictionary.
The NEA spends about $1.2 million in Maine each year. That money supports staff at the Maine Arts Commission, programs such as Poetry Out Loud, and individual artists and arts organizations, who compete for about $500,000 in grants -- some as little as $500, some $50,000 or more.
Maine composer Daniel Sonenberg wrote to Collins on Thursday, objecting to Trump's budget. Sonenberg used $15,000 in NEA money to help complete his opera "The Summer King," which will premiere in late April in Pittsburgh.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which gets $485 million annually and distributes most of that to local public broadcasters, would lose all funding. Maine's statewide public radio and television broadcaster, Maine Public, would lose $1.7 million, or 14 percent of its annual budget.
The loss of such a large chunk of its budget would be "very serious" but would not mean the network's five TV stations and 12 radio stations would "go away," said Mark Vogelzang, Maine Public's CEO. He said Maine Public is in better shape than some public broadcasters because of a $30 million fundraising campaign that began in 2013 and is nearly complete. If federal funding is cut, Maine Public could draw on the funds to fill future budget gaps, although some of it already has been used to buy stations and equipment for the broadcaster's five-station Maine Public Classical radio network.
"We started (the fundraising campaign) to build Maine Public Classical, to build up our journalism and our digital efforts, and to keep the network strong in the face of the kind of threat we're now facing," Vogelzang said.

Trump wants to eliminate this federal-state partnership, which provides funding for infrastructure, land preservation, workforce training and public services in distressed communities in the "Northern Forest region" of Maine and three other states.
The commission, founded by an act of Congress in 2008, has invested $8 million in the region since 2010, including $250,000 to help Acme Monaco expand in Presque Isle, another $250,000 to three St. John Valley towns to build boat landings and picnic areas for the 2014 World Acadian Congress, $250,000 to upgrade a roadway to attract investment in a Jay stone quarry, and $200,000 to help Van Buren build a vegetable processing plant for local farmers to expand their markets.
"It's been a very valuable source of economic development dollars for Aroostook County," said Jon Gullver, director of innovation and community relations at the Northern Maine Development Commission in Caribou.
The military would see a staggering increase in funding under Trump's proposal. The budget adds $52 billion to the Department of Defense budget, restoring it to the level before cuts made under former President Barack Obama took hold.
Bath Iron Works, the biggest defense contractor in Maine, could benefit from increased defense funding. The shipbuilder relies on military contracts for the bulk of work done there, and Trump has pledged to rebuild military assets, including Navy ships.
If Trump follows through on his pledge to rebuild all areas of the military, including deferred maintenance of equipment and adding new supplies and munitions, that could be good news for other defense contractors.
Pratt & Whitney has a facility in Berwick that produces components for the F-35 fighter, though Trump has criticized that program in recent months. A number of smaller engineering and contracting firms in Maine have won defense contracts in recent years.
Spokesmen for both BIW and Pratt & Whitney declined to comment on the budget.
The Department of Veterans Affairs would receive a 6 percent increase in programming funds for the next fiscal year, and a state veterans advocate said there is no question the increased funding will help veterans services in Maine.
"Absolutely, in the long run, it'll be good for us," said Gary Laweryson, of Waldoboro, a retired Marine who is chairman of the Maine Veterans Coordinating Committee. "It's up to us to make sure they use it the right way." The funding boost could allow for some expansion and rehabilitation of buildings at VA Maine Healthcare Systems-Togus, the federal hospital campus outside Augusta, he said.
Trump's plan also calls for $4.6 billion in new funding to improve patient access and timeliness of medical care services. Laweryson said that might help provide additional resources to help rural Maine veterans. "We need to be able to get our rural veterans to the clinics to receive care," he said. "Maybe this means (veterans' agencies) can hire more drivers for additional routes."

Full text: Farmers feed sea urchins kelp-based food to trigger production of valuable uni
What do First Nation villages in Quebec, barren kelp beds in Western Australia, Japanese seafood giant Mitsubishi and a Norwegian investment firm all have in common? The humble sea urchin, and restoring the underwater kelp forests the voracious creature feeds on.
In many parts of the world, sea urchin populations have rebounded and they are systematically clear-cutting kelp forests. Once that happens, they stop producing uni, the roe that sells for $200 a pound. But they survive in a hibernation state, preventing kelp from regrowing. Sea urchin divers leave them alone because the urchins are no longer profitable to harvest.
That's the problem Brian Tsuyoshi Takeda set out to solve when he founded Urchinomics, a revolutionary way to farm sea urchins from the barrens by feeding them a kelp-based food product that triggers production of uni in weeks rather than months.
Urchinomics then monitors the kelp forest restoration process in the area where the farming takes place.
Takeda's brainchild is in the trial stage today in Quebec and the Canadian Maritimes, British Columbia, Australia and Japan.
It works where the sea urchin ecosystem has been affected by environmental forces that eliminate the animals that eat sea urchins.
On the North American west coast, starfish wasting disease killed a major predator of urchins and the population of the spiny shellfish spiked to the point of clear-cutting the kelp beds. The same is happening, for reasons that include global warming and overfishing of other species, in Australia, Japan, Europe, South America and elsewhere.
In order to make this work, Takeda needed to come up with an alternative feed that provided the same nutrients as kelp. Enter Nofima, a leading food science and research firm in Norway that had developed a kelp-based food for farmed urchins.
Takeda's Kaston International, an investment firm that owns rights to Urchinomics and whose president is Takeda, partnered with Nofima to share the proprietary formula with others who are restoring kelp beds and farming urchins.
In trials over the past few years, the special feed triggers roe growth of 25 percent -- the ideal ratio for commercial sales -- in 12 to 16 weeks.
Last June Mitsubishi's Nosan Corp. sent a group of scientists to Norway to learn about the feed and its application in Japan, where kelp beds on the west coast were devastated by the 2011 tsunami.
Last November, Takeda signed an agreement with the Ekuanitshit Nation in Quebec to begin a pilot project. The 400-member band lives on an island and struggles economically.
Takeda believes that the project could offer them a lifeline. "If they succeed, it will give young people an economic base without (moving) into the cities," he says.
Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans began a trial this year in northern Vancouver Island. The DFO study will use about 2,000 green and 1,000 red urchins harvested by divers from the Strait of Georgia and fed in trays suspended in the ocean near the station.
On Australia's southeast coast, along New South Wales and Victoria to eastern Tasmania, infestations of long-spined sea urchins, likely because of warming oceans and overfishing of predators, are turning undersea kelp forests to barren wastelands. Here, Urchinomics partnered with Hobart's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies and local aquaculture companies to take urchins from the barrens and fatten them on special feeding cages suspended from existing oyster or mussel lines.
Takeda, who was born in Japan, moved to Canada when he was a child, and now lives with his Norwegian wife in western Norway, says the various pilot projects have produced market-grade uni that has been tested in Tokyo on a trial basis so far.
He expects production will be up to commercial volumes by the end of 2017.
"If all goes well," Takeda says, "I think Japan will start producing farmed urchins from barrens by Q4 2017. I am hoping Canada would do so as well, but that is entirely dependent on the feed being locally manufactured to our specs by then."
"We are hoping to sign a licensed feed manufacturing agreement that covers North America by next month."
Throughout the process of getting sea urchins in production of high-quality roe, Takeda never loses sight of the other goals of his enterprise -- improving kelp forest ecosystems and providing meaningful employment in rural communities.
"I think this is perhaps as important as everything else. ... I think we tackle overfishing in a completely different way," he said.

Full text: Senators submit bill to help aging Mainers
PORTLAND ï¿½ Senators from Maine and Hawaii say a proposal they are submitting would help make it easier for seniors to grow older in their own homes.
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, and Sen. Angus King, an independent, of Maine, are joined by Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, in proposing the changes. The senators say the Senior Home Modification Assistance Initiative Act would better coordinate existing federal home modification programs.
The senators say their proposal also would provide more consumer-friendly information on how the programs can benefit seniors.
Scalloping ground closes for season
PERRY ï¿½ Fishing regulators are shutting down Maineï¿½s most productive scallop fishing grounds for the season to protect the valuable shellfish.
Cobscook Bay is the most important scalloping area along the Maine coast. Maine marine resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher says it needs to be shut down for the season on Sunday to make sure it stays fertile. Maineï¿½s scallop season runs from December to April, but the closure of Cobscook typically represents a slowing down of the season. Maine fishermen harvested more than 530,000 pounds of scallops in 2016. That was the second-most productive scallop fishing year in the state since 2001.
Strip club operator accused of exploitation
DENVER ï¿½ A Colorado company that owns over a dozen strip clubs around the country is facing a federal lawsuit over allegations that it exploited its dancers by requiring them to pay fees in order to work.
The lawsuit, filed Friday in Denver, alleges that the clubs, including PTï¿½s Showclubs in Colorado, Maine, Florida, Kentucky, and Indiana, charged the workers fees based on the time of day they worked and also took portions of their tips to pay bouncers and DJs.
The suit was filed on behalf of a woman who worked at a club in Denver but her lawyers are also seeking compensation for potentially hundreds of other women who work in the clubs owned by the company, VCG Holding Corp. It declined to comment.
Judge dismisses suit filed by child rapist
DOVER, Del. ï¿½ A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a former Maine resident serving 18 years in a Delaware prison for child sex abuse.
Thirty-six-year-old James Ira Allen claimed police made mistakes in investigating and arresting him. He wanted the judge to dismiss his criminal charges and award him $40 million in damages.
The judge ruled Friday that the law enforcement officials were immune from liability and that Allenï¿½s claims were frivolous. He previously pleaded guilty to raping and sexually exploiting a 14-year-old girl found with him in a Georgetown motel in 2015.

Full text: A Trump administration proposal to slash funding to the federal government's principle marine agency and eliminate the national Sea Grant program is prompting alarm in Maine's marine sector because it depends on services provided by both.
Trump wants to slash the budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- the agency responsible for fisheries management, weather forecasting, nautical surveys and assisting marine industries -- by 17 percent, the Washington Post reported Friday. And he wants to eliminate NOAA's Sea Grant program, the marine equivalent of the federal agricultural extension and research service, in the fiscal 2018 budget that begins Oct. 1.
"There was a lot of concern when the news broke, and a flurry of messages went out to our Congressional delegation from fishermen and aquaculturists who understand how they benefit from Sea Grant," said Paul Anderson, director of Maine Sea Grant at the University of Maine in Orono, one of 33 Sea Grant universities in the country. "I don't now if on October 1st we will all of a sudden not exist."
The news has sent reverberations across Maine's marine community, which has long benefited from the partnership between UMaine and the federal government. Sea Grant researchers created the Fishermen's Forum -- the industry's premier event -- in 1976, and also helped found the Portland Fish Exchange and the university's Lobster Institute, which researches issues of concern to the industry.
It has funded groundbreaking work on how to monitor juvenile lobster populations so researchers can better predict future health of the stock; assisted mussel, scallop and kelp farmers with research and methodological expertise; developed organic certification guidelines for sea vegetable growers; and helped monitor and contain bacteria and other marine pests that plague shellfish growers and harvesters.
"People are in shock over this," said Bill Mook, founder of Mook Sea Farm, an oyster hatchery in Bristol. "Aquaculture has been identified as a very big area for economic development in Maine, and Sea Grant, and NOAA and NOAA's satellites are all critical to all that. This jeopardizes Maine's ability to realize the opportunities aquaculture may afford us."
The Trump administration has proposed eliminating the $73 million Sea Grant program in its fiscal 2018 budget, according to preliminary figures from the Office of Management and Budget obtained by the Post. The numbers could change as NOAA negotiates with the White House in the coming weeks and are ultimately subject to Congressional amendment or approval.
The document also proposes a 22 percent cut to NOAA's satellite program, which may be a target because the data it collects has been used to monitor climate change. NOAA's fisheries agency -- the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) -- would face a 5 percent cut, as would the National Weather Service, which provides the data used by most meteorologists and the Weather Channel. The agency's coastal zone management, external research and estuary reserve programs would be eliminated.
Former NOAA administrators from the George W. Bush and Obama administrations told the Post the cuts would compromise the safety of citizens and the needs of business and the military.
Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, said the cuts to NOAA would be terrible for fishermen. "The industry relies pretty heavily on their forecast reports on the wind and the wave heights and make decisions day to day if they are going to go out, so those satellites are really important," she said. "And nobody loves NMFS, but keeping them fully funded and their research going is essential to manage our fisheries." She noted that recent cuts to the agency's right whale monitoring program had hurt fishermen because if scientists didn't have time to find the whales they had to assume they weren't there, increasing the regulatory burden on lobstermen, whose gear the whales sometimes get entangled in.
UMaine receives $1.2 million a year from NOAA to run its Sea Grant program, and leverages another $600,000 from the state and other sources, Anderson said. The money funds scientific research, pollution monitoring, technical training and research and development for industry, the creation of information resources for towns and businesses, and the exhibits of the Downeast Fisheries Trail, a tourist attraction. In the worst-case scenario, most funds could be cut off Oct. 1, imperiling all existing research programs and the work of the program's extension officers, who provide expert assistance to marine industries.
"They're not just an agency that's funded and sits in Orono. Their people are part of our communities, and the idea that it could all disappear with the mark of a pen just shows an incredible lack of understanding of the way Sea Grant is integrated into our lives," said Rob Snyder, president of the Island Institute in Rockland, a non-profit that works to sustain island and coastal communities. "It's inconceivable that we would put all these fishermen and lives and livelihoods at risk because we don't have funding in place."
Paul Dobbins, president of Ocean Approved in Portland, which farms kelp, said Sea Grant was essential to the birth of his industry in Maine. "A farmer in the Midwest trying a new crop or something would bring in an agricultural extension officer to their farm," he said. "With Sea Grant, there's this repository of knowledge and agents to play that role for us in the sea."
The Department of Commerce declined to comment to the Post on the cuts, but an unnamed White House official told the paper that the process was "evolving" and that the administration would not comment on questions about the document. The cuts would be part of the budget and subject to approval by Congress.
"I think we can all agree we would like to make American greater, but cutting this kind of thing is the way to not do that," Mook said. "It's like cutting off our pathway to getting greater."

Full text: Speaker wonï¿½t convene ethics committee
PORTLAND ï¿½ Maineï¿½s Democratic House speaker said she wonï¿½t convene a committee to investigate whether the House chairman of the taxation committee violated ethics rules for working for a ballot referendum campaign.
Republican Rep. Heather Sirocki asked House Speaker Sara Gideon to convene the House ethics committee to consider whether Democratic Rep. Ryan Tipping has a conflict of interest for accepting at least $9,000 from a group that successfully pushed for a new income surtax to fund public schools.
Gideon told Sirocki in a letter Friday sheï¿½s confident Tipping will continue to serve as a fair committee chairman. Sirocki works in the dental field and Gideon said she introduced related bills. Sirocki didnï¿½t immediately comment Friday.
A state ethics commission cleared Tippingï¿½s employment. Republicans wanted legislators to review his conduct.
Woman dies in crash near turnpike exit
AUBURN ï¿½ Police say a woman has died following a two-vehicle crash near a Maine Turnpike exit in Auburn.
They said a pickup truck collided with a sedan operated by 48-year-old Crystal Hewitt, of Turner early Friday. She died at Central Maine Medical Center. A passenger in her vehicle was treated and released from a hospital.
Scallop fishing areas to close temporarily
PORTLAND ï¿½ Maine fishing regulators are temporarily closing several scallop fishing areas beginning this weekend to prevent the valuable shellfish from over-harvest.
WCSH-TV reported the state Department of Marine Resources closures take effect on Sunday for the Damariscotta River in Lincoln County, North Haven and mid-Penobscot Bay.
The closures will also take place in the Lower Blue Hill Bay and Jericho Bay area, and the Chandler Bay and Head Harbor area.
The closures are typical of the stateï¿½s highly regulated scallop fishing season, which ends in early spring. The state uses the closures to ensure that different areas around the state donï¿½t become overexploited.
Scallops typically sell for $20 to $25 per pound to consumers at markets and grocery stores.

Full text: AS MAINE HAS struggled to build a 21st-century economy, we've faced many challenges, most of them man-made and some geographic. We've been painfully slow to accept how the world was changing around us, and unwilling to hear the warnings of economists about how manufacturing, forestry, farming and fishing would change.
Instead, we've spent too much of our time locked in senseless battles based on region and political differences and whether we live in cities or the countryside. And we've watched as the state's economy has lost momentum and energy, and our young people have left.
Now we're doing a similar thing with climate change. We've been reluctant to heed the warnings of scientists who study these things every day. We've ignored the signs that are appearing all around us. We've confused political views with facts. Because of those things, the challenges for Maine, and for our economy, are growing.
Now we're not only cold, remote, expensive, disorganized, discouraged and disgruntled; we're also ill-informed.
Climate change is going to alter much of what we now see in our minds when we think of Maine. Some familiar things will become rare, while others that we have little experience with will seem to be everywhere. Think of ticks, peach trees, new plant diseases, possums, vultures and insect-borne diseases.
Some people still maintain that climate change isn't real, and they've employed a string of senseless and sometimes dishonest arguments to make their point. They've ridiculed computer projections, derided scientists, blamed cow flatulence and dead trees -- anything but the role that burning coal, gas and oil plays. Now they say that climate change is a conspiracy among all of the world's scientists, engineered by China.
Losing ground in the public debate, climate deniers are now moving toward another strategy, led by the new president. Silence science. Cut funding to agencies, like NASA and NOAA, who collect and publish temperature data from around the world. Book burning can't be far behind.
The problem with gagging scientists, from an economic standpoint, is that it will leave American businesses flying blind against global competitors who aren't. And while they're building technologies for the future, we'll be re-opening coal mines.
Most common-sense people seem to understand that our climate is changing and that burning fossil fuels over the last hundred years or so is the major culprit.
Here's what the scientists -- while they're still free to speak -- have been telling us.
[bullet] 2016 was the warmest year on record, beating out 2015, which beat out 2014. Sixteen of the last 17 years have produced global temperature records.
[bullet] Alaska and New England are warming faster than the rest of the country.
[bullet] New England will feel impacts 20 years earlier than other places.
[bullet] Our average annual temperature will rise by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over historical levels within 20 years, making us more like southern New England than Maine.
[bullet] The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than almost any place on the planet.
[bullet] Sea levels in New England could rise by as much as 10.5 feet by 2100, or twice what was earlier predicted. That would put 30 percent of Boston and many parts of our coastline under water.
What does all of that mean for the Maine economy? Warming climates force everything to migrate north -- plants, trees, animals, insects, diseases and people. Already, we've seen Maine's iconic cod pushed farther offshore and northward. That's why you're not buying much cod at the supermarket that was landed in Portland or New Bedford. Most of it now comes from Iceland and Norway.
Next up will be lobsters and other shellfish. Lobstering is booming now, in part because southern lobsters have moved in. But they won't stop moving. Connecticut, not so long ago, had 300 lobsterman. Today there are only about half a dozen. In Rhode Island, lobstering is virtually non-existent.
In agriculture, forestry and recreation, we can expect longer growing seasons but more rain, icy winters and far less snow. That will release and sustain both diseases and insects we're not prepared for. Think about explosions of ticks, new flying insects, tree and plant diseases. Then add human diseases we have no experience with.
Humans also will migrate, with the possibility of waves of people seeking refuge in places like Maine, while escaping heat and violent storms to the south. While Maine needs more skilled people to grow the economy, let's face it, managing change has not been our strong suit.
The most immediate and compelling challenge we face is that our political leadership, in Maine and in the White House, just doesn't get it.

Full text:   Lawmaker's son facing meth, OUI charges
SCARBOROUGH -- The son of a Scarborough lawmaker has been charged with having methamphetamine and operating under the influence.
Police said they found 25-year-old Dylan Volk in the driver's seat of a running car in Scarborough early Sunday after someone reported a car had gone off the road.
Police arrested him after smelling alcohol and conducting a field sobriety test. Police said they also found a straw and a rocklike substance in a headphone case. Tests showed the substance was methamphetamine.
Volk, who was released on $260 bail, is the son of Republican Sen. Amy Volk, of Scarborough. It's unclear if he's retained a lawyer.
Amy Volk said no family is immune from the drug epidemic. She said she loves her son and respects that he's taking responsibility and seeking treatment.
Ogunquit art museum gets new director
OGUNQUIT -- An art museum in Ogunquit has chosen a curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum to serve as its new executive director.
Michael Mansfield, 42, will begin his new job at the Ogunquit Museum of American Art on Feb. 1.Museum board president David Mallen announced the hiring on Monday. Mansfield, a Texas native, earned a bachelor's degree in photography and art history from the University of Houston. He also earned a master's in digital and electronic media from the Maryland Institute.
Mansfield joined the Smithsonian museum in 2008. He designed its first gallery for moving images.
Mansfield said he plans to learn about the nuances of the museum's collection and develop ways to incorporate his contemporary art perspective into the displays.
Report: Gas plan may not help taxpayers
AUGUSTA -- A recent report said Maine taxpayers are unlikely to benefit from plans to invest up to $75 million a year into storing natural gas in liquid form.
The report found 11 proposals received by the Maine Public Utilities Commission are not expected to provide a big return on investment for ratepayers if the proposed Access Northeast pipeline is built.
The report said if the pipeline isn't built, the proposals could benefit ratepayers in a best-case scenario.
Maine legislators passed a law saying regulators could execute a contract that's commercially reasonable, among other things.
The idea is to reserve space in yet-to-be-built liquefied natural gas tanks and then convert the liquid back to gas in winter when prices spike.
One company is now asking regulators to let companies submit new offers.
Liberty explosion, fire leave man injured
LIBERTY -- Fire officials said a man was hurt after a manufacturing facility in Liberty caught fire, leading to several explosions because of hazardous materials that were inside.
WLBZ-TV reports fire crews from nearly a dozen towns responded to Magnum Manufacturing Inc. on state Route 3 on Sunday night.
Officials said a man believed to be leasing the space has been taken to a hospital with injuries that aren't considered life-threatening.
Liberty Fire Chief Bill Gillespie said firefighters experienced difficulties because of the low temperatures. Gillespie says firefighters had to move around on ice while holding a charged line.
The building was destroyed. The state fire marshal's office is investigating the cause of the blaze.
Fishermen to aid study of declining shrimp
PORTLAND -- Three New England states said they have tapped fishermen to collect samples of a species of shrimp that was the source of a lucrative fishery before it started disappearing.
Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire have all picked fishermen to harvest Northern shrimp to help gather information about the stock. The fishermen will also be allowed to sell a limited number of the shrimp on the open market.
The program will employ 10 trawlers and five trappers who will fish for eight weeks starting in the middle of this month.
Fishermen typically harvested more than 2,000 tons of the shrimp per year before the catch collapsed in 2013. The fishery has been shuttered by the government since. Scientists say warming waters off New England are inhospitable for the shrimp.
Gas prices rising around New England
CONCORD, N.H. -- Retail gas prices in northern New England have gone up a bit.
Gas price website GasBuddy's survey said the average retail gasoline prices in Maine have risen 1.8 cents per gallon in the past week. They now average $2.40 per gallon. In New Hampshire, average prices have gone up nearly a penny per gallon, to $2.31. Princes in Vermont remained flat at $2.40 after a big increase the week before.
The national average has gone up 2.1 6 cents per gallon in the last week to $2.37 per gallon.
The national average has climbed 39.3 cents per gallon from a year ago.

PORTLAND -- A developer is seeking approval for a $13 million condominium development near an Interstate 295 off-ramp in Portland.
City planning documents indicate the four-story building would have 22 single-bedroom units and 23 two-bedroom units ranging from roughly 560 square feet to about 1,500 square feet. Parking for 45 vehicles would also be available.
Portland's planning and urban development director said they're reviewing the proposal. No date is set for a Planning Board workshop or hearing.
The area has seen a flood of restaurants, cafes and distilleries in recent years.
The city last year approved a proposal for a property owner to use shipping containers as retail stores. Two five-story condominium buildings have also been proposed.
Scallop fishermen to get extra day
LUBEC -- Maine fishing regulators said they are allowing many of the state's scallop fishermen to fish for an additional day per week because bad weather has hampered their ability to harvest the shellfish.
The state Department of Marine Resources said the dragger boat fleet that operates outside of the protected Cobscook Bay area will be afforded the extra day.
Regulators said fishermen are reporting good catches off of Maine when they are able to get out on the water. Prices are also strong. Maine scallops are some of the most sought after in the seafood industry.
The state has closed four areas to fishing because they have met their harvesting targets for the year. The scallop fishing season began about five weeks ago and runs into the early spring.

Full text:   UMaine System likely to produce only half of graduates needed in next decade
Maine schools will not graduate enough engineers in the next decade to keep up with projected demand, and the shortfall could hamper the state's economic growth.
That's the consensus of engineering professionals and educators who believe that better pay outside Maine will lure graduates away while the state struggles to expand its capacity to train engineers here.
The Maine economy has gained more than 800 new engineering jobs in the last decade, expanding a foundation for high-tech industries, construction and manufacturing. Each engineer working in Maine right now adds $560,000 to Maine's gross domestic product, according to a University of Maine analysis.
But the University of Maine System will produce only half the graduates needed to fill open engineering jobs in the next decade, mostly to replace people who have retired. About 27 percent of Maine's engineering workforce is 55 or older, said Dana Humphrey, dean of the University of Maine College of Engineering in Orono, laying the groundwork for impending shortages. With intense national competition for recent engineering graduates, Maine companies look primarily to the college to recruit new employees.
"If Maine thinks it can solve its shortage of engineers by bringing them in from other places, it is not going to happen," Humphrey added. "It is going to have to produce its own."
Though there is surging interest in engineering from students, the college is stretched to its limits. For the first time, the school had to turn away students from their preferred area of study in 2016, Humphrey said, and that trend is likely to continue.
"We are bursting at the seams," he said.
A recent projection from the university for 2026 estimates Maine will create 810 new engineering jobs and need to replace 1,750 retiring engineers, plus others who leave the workforce, creating about 2,560 openings in all. At the same time, Maine is expected to produce 1,300 graduates to work in the state, leaving a shortfall of at least 1,260. Currently about 60 percent of Maine engineering graduates stay in the state.
"We need every engineer we can get plus more. It doesn't matter the discipline," Humphrey said.
Rick McCarthy, executive director of the American Council of Engineering Companies of Maine, echoed Humphrey's call for more engineering graduates. He said areas such as Boston and parts of California are booming, thanks in part to the critical mass of talented engineers.
"The best way to get those jobs here is to train them here, with the expectation that they stay," McCarthy said.
But he acknowledges when it comes to pay, Maine lags behind many states. The average annual wage for engineering positions in Maine is $72,300, compared to a national average of almost $83,000, according to the U.S. Census Occupational Survey.
Meagan Lewis, a 2016 University of Maine graduate, said higher salary was a reason she took a job as a systems engineer at MITRE Corp., a not-for-profit government contractor in Virginia. The company also had opportunities she couldn't find in Maine, Lewis said. Many of her other friends from Maine also found jobs out of state.
"A few of them just wanted to get out of Maine. They had been there their whole lives. Why not see a different part of the country?" Lewis said. "The ones who stayed wanted to stay closer to home."
That's Gregory Smiddy's situation. Smiddy, who will graduate from the University of Maine in May, already has a job lined up at the Pratt and Whitney aircraft turbine plant in North Berwick. The job lets him work in aviation and keeps him in Maine, close to his family, Smiddy said.
"I really lucked out; I couldn't be happier with my position once I get out of school," Smiddy said. "To be able to stay in Maine and have a job I really like is something else. It is amazing."
UMaine is the dominant source for engineering degrees in the state, although some are given at the University of Southern Maine and Maine Maritime Academy in Castine. Enrollment at UMaine's engineering school has increased 74 percent since 2001. Humphrey said about 1,800 undergraduate and 200 postgraduate students attend the engineering college. An incoming freshman class has 450 to 500 students.
The university has invested in state-of-the-art research laboratories such as the Advanced Structures and Composites Center, Humphrey said, but its five academic buildings are aging and cramped, and they have laboratory space that is functionally obsolete.
"Our buildings do need to be upgraded, modern facilities to be compatible with how we teach today, not 20 years ago," Humphrey said.
The University of Southern Maine has approximately doubled its enrollment in the past decade to 200 and expects continued growth, said Mariusz Jankowski, chairman of the school's engineering department.
"Both institutions recognize the need for increased investment in engineering," Jankowski said. "I would certainly hope that message gets across, and the solution is that we use the opportunity to invest in both institutions, when the decision is made to increase access to engineering in Maine."
That infrastructure is critical to producing engineers in a competitive landscape.
"If the University of Maine is not able to pump them out or is compromised because of a lack of capabilities or other resources, it will further compromise our ability to hire those engineers and hopefully keep them in the state of Maine," said Chuck Padera, president of Kleinschmidt, a 140-employee firm based in Pittsfield with offices in seven states and two Canadian provinces. "Right now, if you are graduating from a qualified engineering school, you get to pick where you want to go; the world truly is your oyster."
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the economy will add 67,200 new architecture and engineering jobs, a 3 percent increase, by 2024. According to a 2016 survey from human resources firm ManpowerGroup, 82 percent of companies reported having difficulty finding engineers, even though 95 percent said they were planning to hire in 2016. The survey pointed to problems similar to those in Maine, such as a workforce facing retirement age and a need for more education and training of new engineers.
"It is clear the demand for engineers is growing very, very rapidly and has been growing over the past number of years across the country," said David Raymond, president and CEO of the American Council of Engineering Companies. Expanded demand for engineers in new industries such as high tech and biotechnology is helping drive the need to produce more graduates across the country, Raymond added.
"The real question is demand," Raymond said. "If demand is sustainable, then the institutions will find a way to fill it."
In a busy market, small firms such as Acorn Engineering in Portland have a particularly tough time recruiting new hires. A glut of engineers during the recession turned into a shortage as the economy improved, Acorn owner William Savage said. His company wasn't advertising open jobs, but he recently hired a University of Maine graduate who sent a handwritten letter expressing interest in the company's watershed restoration work.
"Everyone is trying to hire engineers; we can't pass up that opportunity. We hired him on the spot," Savage said. "That is the mentality right now."

Full text:   After garnering national attention and accolades for its oysters and its brown butter lobster roll, Portland's Eventide Oyster Co. is planning to expand to Boston.
The new Eventide is planned for a space on Boylston Street in Boston's Fenway neighborhood.
Mike Wiley, one of the three owners, said Monday that long lines at the Middle Street restaurant are the main reason for expanding.
The owners picked Boston, he said, partly because they have friends there and because of Boston's larger, more steady customer base.
"It's less seasonal down there," said Wiley. "If you've seen the lines we have, you know there's room for growth."
Wiley did not want to discuss other details and referred questions to a public relations firm, Marlo Marketing.
A statement from the firm said Wiley and his co-owners, known as Big Tree Hospitality, are "actively involved in securing space for a new restaurant concept at 1321 Boylston Street in Boston."
Erin Mack, account director with Marlo Marketing, said in an email that the restaurant's owners are aiming for a spring opening in 2017. She said they also will open a commissary kitchen in Biddeford to "streamline" production for both the Portland and Boston restaurants. The new restaurant will be called Eventide Fenway and will offer "Eventide Oyster Co.'s greatest hits. A concise and creative seafood menu in a casual counter-service setting," Mack said.
Besides Wiley, Big Tree Hospitality includes chef Andrew Taylor and Arlin Smith, the general manager. They own three restaurants in the same building on Middle Street.
The group bought Hugo's, which opened in the late 1980s, in March 2012. Eventide opened two months later. They opened The Honey Paw in 2015.
News of Portland chefs expanding their businesses out of state is rare and is an example of how strong the city's restaurant scene is right now, said Steve Hewins, president and chief executive of the Maine Restaurant Association.
"Often we've imported a lot of chefs, though we've grown a lot, too," Hewins said. "But to export our restaurants shows that this new wave of Maine chefs includes people doing some great things."
The owners of Arrows Restaurant in Ogunquit, which had a national reputation, expanded to Boston in 2014 with a restaurant called M.C. Spiedo in the Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel. It has since been replaced by a new restaurant.
Eventide's reputation is already known in the Boston area, thanks to media coverage and because of all the "food tourists" from Eastern Massachusetts who come to Portland regularly, Hewins said. The restaurant blog on Boston magazine's website referred to Eventide recently as "one of New England's hottest restaurants."
The restaurants have been written up in national food magazines, as well as by the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
For their work at Eventide, Wiley and Taylor were nominated for James Beard Awards for the past two years in the Best Chef: Northeast category. The awards are like the Oscars for chefs. The pair did not win.
This year, Eventide was listed as one of the 38 "most essential restaurants in the nation" by the national food blog Eater.com.
Hewins said he hopes that Eventide's expansion could have a bigger effect, helping to expand the reputation of Portland's restaurant scene overall.

Full text:   Sustain, Override dogs tops LePage's wish list
AUGUSTA -- GOP Gov. Paul LePage wants to get two new canine buddies named Sustain and Override for his dogs Jack and Veto.
LePage's dogs made an appearance on his weekly interview on WVOM-FM. The dogs barked in the background Tuesday as LePage criticized a newly approved 3 percent surtax on Maine individual incomes above $200,000.
LePage wants to cut Maine's top marginal rate, but said Tuesday he won't propose a sales tax increase.
The governor laughed as he said he's trying to get his wife to allow him to get more dogs. His suggested names of Sustain and Override come as a sharply divided legislature makes its way to Augusta.
LePage, Maine's all-time veto champ, said he picked the name Veto because the Jack Russell terrier's a "defender of the Maine people."
Portland OKs contract granting pay raises
PORTLAND -- The Portland City Council has approved a new contract with the city's largest union that will increase wages by $1.1 million over the next three years.
The Portland Press Herald reported the agreement with roughly 500 workers in the City Employee Benefits Association was approved Monday and provides annual increases of 2 percent.
CEBA represents most permanent employees, except for firefighters and police officers.
The contract with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1373 is set to expire on June 30, 2019.
The city's current budget authorizes 1,283 employees with a municipal payroll of $72.5 million.
Maine's scallop season starts with draggers
PORTLAND -- Maine's scallop fishing season is in full swing with dragger boats now allowed to harvest the valuable shellfish.
Scallops have been increasing in price around the country, and Maine's are some of the most valuable. The dragger fishing season began on Monday.
The season runs until April but is subject to early closures based on how abundant the scallops are. The most productive scallop fishing grounds in the state are in Cobscook Bay on Maine's eastern coast.
Maine scallops reached their highest price at the dock last year at $12.70 per pound. The price to consumers was typically in the $20 to $25 per pound range.
Some Maine fishermen harvest scallops by diving for them. That season began on Dec. 1.
Fishermen allowed same catch of crabs
NEW BEDFORD, Mass. -- Federal regulators say East Coast fishermen will be allowed to catch the same amount of deep sea red crabs in the next few years.
Deep sea red crabs can inhabit depths of nearly 6,000 feet in the Atlantic Ocean and are fished off of New England and the mid-Atlantic. They are harvested for use as fresh picked crab meat and frozen crab legs.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says fishermen will be allowed to catch nearly 4 million pounds of the crabs in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The crabs are brought to shore mostly in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Norfolk, Virginia.
NOAA says catch was below quota in recent years, but has been increasing. The agency says scientists believe continuing the current volume of catch won't cause overfishing.

Full text:   Maine scientists are decrying the assertion by a senior adviser to President-elect Donald Trump that the new administration will eliminate or dramatically scale back NASA's climate research.
The scientists say the elimination of the agency's earth science programs would be catastrophic for climate science research in Maine, impairing their ability to detect and analyze effects on fisheries, forests and agriculture.
Maine is a hub of climate research -- especially as it relates to the oceans -- and the work relies on the data collected by NASA satellites and processed by the agency's experts.
"If we lose these data sets and capabilities, that will be a major loss to us being able to monitor and track changes here in Maine and in other areas that impact us," said Andrew Thomas, a professor of oceanography at the University of Maine's School of Marine Sciences, which receives more than a sixth of its research funds from NASA. "Basically, you're chopping off one of your arms and saying, 'Carry on.'" The school's Satellite Data Lab is using NASA data to analyze effects of melting ice in the Gulf of Alaska and to monitor marine algae production in the California Current.
Bob Walker, a former Pennsylvania congressman who serves as Trump's space policy adviser, said in interviews last week that the administration would realign NASA's budget, prioritizing exploration of "deep space" over space-based observations of Earth, which he has previously characterized as "politically correct environmental monitoring." Earth observations would instead be made by the National Science Foundation or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, two much smaller agencies with little experience or expertise in space-based climate monitoring.
Trump himself has previously described climate change as a hoax "created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive," though he more recently conceded there was "some connectivity" between human actions and the climate. With Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, Trump will likely have a free hand to halt NASA climate research, which has expanded substantially under President Obama.
Walker, who was considered to lead NASA under President George W. Bush, said last week that he "would like to be in the position of backing sound science not politicized science" and claimed, erroneously, that there was widespread disagreement among climate scientists as to whether climate change was linked to human activity.
Andrew Pershing, chief science officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, takes issue with Walker's characterization of climate-related research as "politicized."
"That's just not true," said Pershing, whose research revealed that the Gulf of Maine has been warming faster than any other part of the world oceans since 2004, save a section of ocean current north of Japan.
"Climate science is just science. The approach that's led to our understanding of how carbon dioxide works on our planet is the same approach that led to the DNA revolution, cellphones and all the other stuff we have in our daily lives."
Pershing's colleagues at GMRI are building models of how fish move in response to changing ocean conditions. "Satellites really give us the ability to look at what is going on and how the fish, animals and plants in the ocean are responding," he said. "The world needs good science to provide the evidence we need to figure out what we are going to do over the next century."
A sharp reduction in NASA research would have economic effects as well, said Thomas of the University of Maine. Climate science is an area in which Maine researchers have world-wide reputations, he said, with dozens of them employed at Maine, GMRI and the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay. "We're talking people losing jobs and grad students who can't show up because there isn't funding to take them on. There are millions of dollars that go into the local economy that won't happen."
Barney Balch, a Bigelow biological oceanographer who has led long-term NASA-funded monitoring of the tiny plants at the base of the Gulf of Maine's food chain, said such cuts would be comparable to "taking the stethoscope away from the doctor." (Disclosure: This reporter is a Bigelow trustee.)
"The key measurements we use to discern change in organisms in the oceans -- sea surface temperature, salinity, ocean color -- they all pretty much exclusively fall under NASA," Balch said. "Other countries use NASA's expertise in these areas because they are so good at it."
The proposed changes wouldn't directly affect one of the most pressing climate-related issues for Maine, the increasing acidification of Gulf of Maine seawater. The more acidic conditions in near-shore waters have wreaked havoc on baby oysters' ability to build their shells and are thought to have similar effects on mussels, clams and possibly even lobsters.
Potential research and monitoring of this issue falls under NOAA, said Rep. Mick Devin, D-Newcastle, who co-chaired a legislative commission that studied the issue, meaning it would not be disrupted by potential changes at NASA.

Full text:   Suspect arrested after shots fired
ELLSWORTH -- A suspect in a weekend shooting is in custody after a search that prompted schools in Ellsworth to close.
Aaron Wagner was arrested on Tuesday. He's expected to appear in court Wednesday on charges of reckless conduct with a firearm and aggravated criminal mischief. It wasn't immediately known if Wagner has an attorney.
Police said the 41-year-old Wagner is accused of shooting out the back window of an SUV at an apartment complex in Ellsworth on Sunday evening while several people were inside. No one was hurt.
The superintendent of Ellsworth schools said the closure on Monday was a matter of public safety.
Authorities probe inmate death
MACHIAS -- Authorities are investigating the death of an inmate at the Washington County Jail in Machias.
WABI-TV reports that guards said they found James Roy, 55, on the floor of his dorm area with a head wound on Friday morning.
He was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead three hours later.
Authorities told the station that preliminary information shows no suspicious cause for the death.
Garland triple-killing trial ready to begin
BANGOR -- Opening statements are anticipated in the trial of a Maine man accused of killing his girlfriend and her two children in Garland.
Police said Keith Coleman, 29, chased down and strangled the children because they had witnessed their mother's death in December 2014.
Jury selection began Monday at the Penobscot Judicial Center, and the process is expected to wrap up Wednesday morning before opening statements.
Coleman has been charged in the deaths of 36-year-old Christina Sargent, 10-year-old Duwayne Coke and 8-year-old Destiny Sargent. Investigators said the bodies were found in a mobile home Coleman shared with the victims.
Tiny houses land man in big trouble with city
PORTLAND -- Officials in Maine's largest city are giving a property owner 30 days to move a pair of tiny houses they say are out of line with local land use codes.
Brent Adler planned to move tenants into the two small structures on Nov. 1. The little houses are on wheels and have about 400 square feet of living space each.
Adler is unsure of what to do with his nontraditional dwellings now. They are sitting on a lot in a densely populated part of the city featuring mostly multifamily housing, not far from City Hall.
He said he thought they would be allowed because they are basically recreational vehicles and he doesn't think the city's codes prohibit a person from parking RVs on land and renting them out.
Report: Aquaculture to grow more shellfish
PORTLAND -- A marketing report released by a marine science institute states Maine's shellfish aquaculture industry is in a position to grow in value by a factor of more than four in the coming years.
Gulf of Maine Research Institute released the report on Wednesday. It states that Maine's aquaculture industry currently provides about $6.5 million in value and has the opportunity to grow to more $30 million by 2030.
The report says the largest areas for potential growth are oyster, mussel and scallop farming. The state's shellfish aquaculture industry currently represents a little less than one percent of oyster, mussel and scallop production in the U.S.
The Hale Group prepared the report at the institute's direction. The Massachusetts firm provides strategy and marketing in the food and agribusiness sectors.

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it.
Linda and I love discovering special places like Forks in the Air in Rangeley -- a casual, comfortable and elegant place. Checking out online reviews of the restaurant before we arrived, I was amused by one that described it as "a gem in the middle of nowhere." That's not how I'd describe Rangeley!
Owner Michael Kupstar first came here at the age of 6 with his dad, who sold boats and sporting goods. He's been coming to Rangeley ever since. His son took his first steps here. Michael has an impressive resume in the restaurant business, from Kentucky to Florida, including management of 1,000 Long John Silver stores and 18-plus years growing Panera from 52 to 1,700 stores.
He has two restaurants in St. Louis, where he lives when he's not in Rangeley. Forks in the Air is a real family project. His son and his son's wife helped design the interior, which is beautiful, including hardwood floors and a tin ceiling. His daughter and her husband handle the social media and Michael's wife manages the finances. Michael and his brother are also chefs and even co-authored a cookbook.
Chef Payson Farrar is a Mainer and a very talented and creative guy, as is sous chef Stone Walter, another Mainer. I'd read one online review by a fellow who loved the braised pork belly appetizer ($11) so much that he also ordered it for dessert. So of course, I started my meal with that. They braise the pork for six hours and it was fantastic, but Linda wouldn't allow me to order it again for dessert.
Our server, Angie, who also is one of the bartenders, was helpful, as was Michael, who loves to roam the restaurant and talk with guests. This is a friendly place. We even had a nice visit with a couple at the next table who were enjoying their honeymoon. I was pleased to see that the restaurant features beers brewed in Farmington by Tumbledown Brewery, one of my favorites.
My entree of pan-seared scallops ($29) was superb, perfectly grilled outside and tender inside, and the barley risotto was good, too -- lots of flavor and a nice texture. With cream, butter, and cheese, well, what's not to like?
Forks in the Air is an unexpected name for a restaurant, so I asked Michael where the name came from. He told us the entertaining story of a friend's grandmother delivering food to the kids table at Thanksgiving. Apparently when the meal was ready to be placed on the table she would exclaim, "Forks in the air!" so there would be room for all the food.
The space was once a hardware store and has been beautifully remodeled. They were able to keep the original hardwood floor. It has been impeccably refinished, and one would never know how much use it has had over the years.
There is a nice bar area with high-top tables for two along one wall, and two comfortable corner booths near the window in the original hardware storefront. They installed a tin punched ceiling similar to one that had been there.
Another room of seating connects to this. Here, the walls are pale green with windows all along one wall. Some tables have a view of the water. The lighting throughout the restaurant is very nice. It is cozy and welcoming with soft music playing in the background. Michael says they were aiming to offer fine dining in a mountain bistro atmosphere.
The menu has soups and salads ($5-$8) and offers small plates as well. Ron at Pleasant Street B&B raved about the mussels and the flatbread small plates, but they had just switched over to a fall menu when we visited.
I ordered the fried green tomato small plate ($9) -- a dish of three tomatoes in a panko and herbed crust arrived with a drizzle of dill aioli. These were so crispy outside, yet creamy and tart inside. They were right up there with the best fried tomatoes I've ever had. I could only eat two, but George polished off the last one after eating his appetizer.
We also had a taste of the spicy sausage and kale soup made with potatoes and a touch of cream. Wow, was that good. I was only going to try a couple of spoonfuls, but I polished it off.
My entree was the pappardelle with organic Maine mushrooms ($19), a dish that Michael had just tried the night before. He loved it, and so did I. The combination of oyster, shiitake and other mushrooms lent a great depth of flavor. Chef Payson makes his own vegetable stock and uses it in the white wine butter sage sauce. The addition of fresh spinach and shaved Parmesan cheese to the al dente pasta made this the most memorable pasta dish I've had in a long time.
The white and dark chocolate bread pudding is famous here. The warm vanilla-scented pudding was perfection. When the chef found out we had ordered the "classic" dessert, he wanted us to try one of the "new" desserts. His creation of pumpkin cheesecake was so light for a cheesecake and the bourbon sour cream topping made this a delight.
Forks in the Air is a real find.

Full text:   harvesting
Parts of the Down East coast have been reopened to shellfish harvesting because of declining levels of a potentially harmful biotoxin produced by an unusual algae bloom.
On Thursday, the Department of Marine Resources re-opened some of the coastline between Calais and Cutler for the harvest of clams, mussels and carnivorous snails, and said clamming will be allowed on a portion of the coast between Isle au Haut to Winter Harbor.
Shellfish harvesting on much of the Down East coast remains restricted because of an algae bloom that produces a toxin that can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, or ASP, in humans. It is unclear if the limited reopening Thursday means the bloom is clearing up or if harvesting bans will be removed in other areas soon.
"We can't speculate, but we continue to test shellfish and phytoplankton along the coast, both inside and outside the impacted areas, and will reopen areas as soon as test results allow," said Jeff Nichols, a spokesman for the department of Marine Resources.
Lifting the emergency restrictions was a relief to clammers who have been kept off the flats for the last two weeks.
Tim Sheehan, who buys clams through his company Gulf of Maine Inc. in Peabody, said some clammers started digging in Cobscook Bay as soon as the opening was announced. He planned to keep his store open late on Thursday to buy product to make up for the shutdown.
"We probably won't get much. Only about a third of our good flats are open," Sheehan said.
Roughly one-third of Maine's coastline was closed two weeks ago after tests of clams and mussels showed highly elevated levels of domoic acid, the toxin linked to ASP. About 5 tons of clams, mussels and quahogs caught around the Jonesport area were recalled because of possible contamination. Mussel harvesting still is closed from Deer Isle to Machiasport, and clam harvesting is restricted from Bar Harbor to Machiasport. There also are closures for quahogs and carnivorous snails in those areas.
Maine periodically closes shellfishing areas because of red tide -- a different harmful algae bloom that can produce the toxin that causes paralytic shellfish poisoning; but it has never had to close off harvesting areas out of concern for ASP. Domoic acid is sometimes produced by a marine phytoplankton called Pseudo-nitzschia that grows quickly, or blooms, in the right conditions. Filter feeders such as mussels and clams eat the algae and store the toxin and can transmit it to humans.
At high levels, domoic acid can cause gastrointestinal discomfort and illness, and more severe symptoms such as respiratory problems, brain damage, memory loss and even death. Although cases of ASP in humans are rare, researchers believe it is more common in marine mammals such as sea lions.
The federal limit for domoic acid is 20 parts per million in shellfish flesh. Harvesting areas are usually closed if testing shows that level or higher. Test scores for Maine shellfish in the state's affected areas were as high as 129 parts per million, Nichols said two weeks ago.
A Pseudo-nitzschia bloom also has forced shellfishing closures in southern New England.
A week ago, Rhode Island authorities closed major shellfishing areas in Narragansett Bay and most of its eastern coastline because of a major toxic algae bloom. The closure remains in effect, although early tests show no toxins in shellfish. This is the first time the state has issued closures because of a harmful algae bloom, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management said.
Massachusetts put a shellfish closure on Buzzard's Bay, bordering Rhode Island, at the same time as its neighbor. Massachusetts expanded its closure this week to all the waters south of Cape Cod, including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.
Kate Hubbard, an expert on harmful algae blooms in Florida who sometimes works with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute on Cape Cod, said Pseudo-nitzschia is common in New England waters, but it is still unclear what factors produced a toxic bloom this year. Wind, sunlight, hydraulic conditions and ocean water temperatures could be involved, and there is no indication how long the bloom could last, she said.
"We are still very much in the process of working to try and understand why this year was so special," Hubbard said.

Full text:   Bloom producing domoic acid could cause brain damage
An unusual bloom of toxic algae has closed a third of Maine's coastline to clam and mussel harvesting and triggered a widespread shellfish recall.
Last week, the Department of Marine Resources issued a recall; of mussels, clams and quahogs caught in Downeast Maine after samples tested positive for domoic acid, a biotoxin that causes illness, memory loss, brain damage and possibly death in humans.
At the same time, the state banned harvesting for mussels, clams, oysters and carnivorous snails on parts of a wide swath of coastline from Deer Isle to the Canadian border.
This is the first time an algae bloom producing toxic domoic acid has occurred in Maine, although low levels of the toxin have been found in shellfish for decades. Some recent mussels and clams showed domoic acid levels of up to 100 parts per million, five times the level considered unsafe for human consumption.
"A closure for this toxin in Eastern Maine is unprecedented, that is not anything anyone has ever seen," said Darcie Couture, a Brunswick marine scientist and former head of the state's marine biotoxin program.
"No one on this coast is that experienced with a domoic acid event," Couture said. "I don't think it is sinking in how serious this is."
The Department of Marine Resources isn't sure what triggered the bloom, how long it will last, or what other species might be affected. This week it started precautionary testing on quahog, Jonah and rock crabs, urchin, whelk and lobster in the impacted area as a precautionary measure.
"We don't have any science that specifically points to anything," Marine Resources spokesman Jeff Nichols said. "Our focus really is on the public health side of this and we are ensuring the closure is implemented and enforced, so far that has been working."
The recall affected mussels and quahogs harvested and stored around Jonesport and clams harvested from Gouldsboro to Jonesport. About five tons of shellfish, 96 percent of the impacted product, were successfully recalled, Nichols said. The recall affected five Maine companies and contaminated mussels made it to retail stores in Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Utah, the Department of Marine Resources said. Soft-shelled clams were found only in Maine and mahogany quahogs were limited to Massachusetts. There is no way to trace the product that wasn't recovered because it was not sold through retail outlets, Nichols said.
There have been no reported illnesses from the contaminated shellfish, the Department of Marine Resources said.
The recall and closures have been a financial blow to Downeast harvesters and shellfish dealers.
"Anytime there is something in the news about the safety of shellfish, it affects the market," said Albert Carver, who owns A.C. Inc., a shellfish dealer in Beals. He would not specifically say how much product was affected, but the financial impact was "significant." This is the first recall Carver has had in 40 years of doing business.
Dealers and harvesters are used to closures, usually for toxic algae blooms known as red tide that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. But no one is sure what to expect this time around, Carver said.
"Generally we get closed for red tide, the state of Maine is extra good at predicting that," Carver said.
"This is new, it is a different critter, it affects things differently, we don't have any history of it."
Domoic acid is produced by a marine phytoplankton called Pseudo-nitzschia that grows rapidly, or blooms, under the right environmental conditions. Filter feeders like mussels and clams eat the algae and store the toxin. The toxin can work its way into the food network, poisoning other fish, crustaceans, seabirds and marine mammals.
In humans, domoic acid causes Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, or ASP, named for the short-term memory loss it produces. Early symptoms of ASP include vomiting, nausea and diarrhea, but it can progress to severe problems like dizziness, confusion, motor weakness, respiratory problems, coma and even death. An ASP outbreak in Prince Edward Island, Canada, in 1987 killed three people and sickened more than 100.
"It's a serious issue, it requires attention," said Sandra Shumway, a shellfish expert at the University of Connecticut. "If it is showing up in those high numbers I'd be worried, it is a very nasty toxin."
While Maine has little experience with domoic acid, states on the Pacific Coast are familiar with the problem. A bloom last year stretched from central California to Washington and into Alaska. The bloom involved some of the highest domoic acid concentrations ever observed in Monterey Bay and the central Oregon coast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Northwest fisheries office.
The high readings forced an early closure of razor clam industry in Washington and Oregon last year. Tests in one area; in Washington showed toxin levels of 170 parts per million in clams, more than eight times the level considered unsafe for human consumption. Washington shut down most of its lucrative Dungeness crab fishery last summer because the crustaceans tested for high toxin levels.
In Maine, the state regularly tests shellfish at 80 monitoring sites and updates its closure maps. Currently, mussels, carnivorous snails and surf clams are closed from Deer Isle to the Canadian border. All other clams are closed from Bar Harbor to the border and European oysters are closed from Deer Isle to Machiasport, Nichols said.
In order to open an area, there need to be two clean shellfish meat samples, less than 20 parts per million, recorded seven days apart.
"There is no set time line for this," said Nichols, the Marine Resources spokesman. "We just continue to rigorously monitor the coast. We don't know how long this is going to last."

Now they tell you about it -- their favorite inns, restaurants, trips, activities, experiences, travel books and websites -- in their own personal style. They offer anecdotes, tips and the details you need. Join them in exploring the great state of Maine.
A sunny September day in the Boothbay Harbor area featured a lengthy visit to the fascinating Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens and a great lunch on the deck at Tug's Pub at Robinson's Wharf in Southport -- all just a few minutes from downtown Boothbay Harbor.
Seals cavorted in the harbor as we enjoyed a tasty lunch, starting with Linda's favorite brew -- Geaghan Brothers' Presque Isle Honey Blonde ale. The menu of seafood dishes is lengthy, as you might expect, but there are lots of other choices from burgers to roast beef and chicken wraps.
My haddock wrap ($12) was broiled haddock, which Linda praised as a healthy choice (not always a goal of mine). With tartar sauce, lettuce, tomato and sweet Spanish onions, it was as tasty as it sounds and large as well. I enjoyed coleslaw on the side.
The deck is full of beautiful white Adirondack chairs, a great place to relax, and I noted several grandparents sitting there while the grandchildren cavorted around the deck, some taking photos. We lingered, enjoying the sunshine and the view, before heading home.
That morning, we'd spent a couple of hours at the Botanical Gardens, a truly amazing place. If you've never been, put it at the top of your to-do list. I love the easy walks through all the sections from the deep woods to the sea, the kid's area to the Lerner Garden of the Five Senses. Everything is well labeled, so the walk is also a learning experience. All those flowers are stunning.
The Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens is a magical place. Whether a gardener or a non-gardener, child or adult, fit hiker or handicapped, there is something here for everyone. The Visitor Center, Education Center and Central Gardens are accessible for people of all abilities. Info about shuttles, wheelchairs and scooters is available at the information desk.
The idea of these gardens was born in 1991 with the first visitors arriving in 2007. It is now a 270-acre treasure filled with woodland gardens, a pond and quite an array of themed gardens. The Bibby and Harold Alfond Children's Garden is a prime example of what makes this place so special. From the spouting whale rock sculptures and Big Leaf and Small Leaf Gardens to the Coloring Cottage and Story Barn to a vegetable garden and maze lawn, this is a space that is sure to capture the young at heart. The details, like miniature clothing hung out on a clothesline and the owl figures carved in the white picket fence, show how much thought has gone into everything. I really enjoy the Garden of the Five Senses, as well.
Throughout the gardens, perennials and annuals are massed in big expanses that lend wonderful splotches of color. On our September visit there were fantastically large flowers in bloom that had me puzzled. It turns out that they were varieties of hibiscus. A sight of white or red blooms larger than dinner plates is sure to grab attention.
There are longer trails that are great walks with lots of seating along the way to soak up the beauty and relax. A lady coming up the Shoreland Trail greeted us with a sigh and said, "It is so peaceful here." I couldn't agree more. If you can't visit soon, take a look online at some of the pictures of the flowers.
"Gardens Aglow" begins in mid-November, offering spectacular lighted displays that continue through December.
We took a drive around the peninsulas of Southport Island, finding our way to Robinson's Wharf with Tug's Pub and a seafood market. It is situated in a picturesque little cove that is quiet and calming. You are happy to relax with a beer while you wait for your order. "We're in no hurry," George said to our server.
Appetizers included fish tacos with fried haddock and oysters on the half shell. There was also a great selection of sandwiches. You can order your haddock fried or broiled, and there are crab rolls or crab melts. Their unique 207 Burger was topped with two and a half ounces of lobster meat.
But it was the promise of Morse's sauerkraut in a Rachel or a Reuben that held my eye. I was told the difference between the two was that a Rachel has coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. So I guess you know which I chose. This Reuben was made with very lean pastrami that wasn't salty. The marbled rye had a great crunch and the sauerkraut, cheese and thousand island dressing were in perfect proportions.
Robinson's Wharf is a very popular place, and now we know why.

Full text:   WE KNOW THE threat of climate disruption to Maine is real in part because we are experiencing early warning signs. The science is also clear that the problems will escalate if we do not act to further reduce carbon pollution.
There are now many important examples of how a warming climate threatens Maine, and here is one that strikes close to home for many Mainers: our changing marine environment could spell serious trouble for commercial fishing and all those who rely on it for a living. Consider the following:
[bullet] The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 99 percent of world's oceans.
[bullet] Maine's shrimp fishery has been closed for several years now, attributed in part to warmer waters.
[bullet] Lobstermen and other fishermen are bringing up in new species from warming waters with their catch -- presence of new species is not usually a good sign. For example, warming weather contributes to large increases in green crab populations, which ravages Maine clam flats and eelgrass beds.
[bullet] Clams and other shellfish face an existential threat: the same carbon pollution that is warming the globe is making ocean water more acidic and that makes it more and more difficult to build a shell.
These problems affect many Mainers, from commercial fishermen to all the households and businesses that they interact with. Commercial fishing is a $2 billion part of Maine's economy, employing roughly 39,000 people.
We still have time to avoid broad scale impacts, and the solution is very clear: We must reduce the carbon pollution that is warming our land and seas and acidifying our oceans.
Maine has done a lot over the last 15 years to lead on climate and clean energy, but more needs to be done. Gov. Paul LePage recently joined other states in the region in setting a good achievable goal, consistent with science of reducing carbon pollution by 35 percent to 45 percent by 2030.
The question is: What are the most cost-effective ways to reduce this pollution? That's where the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) comes in.
RGGI is the Northeast states' market-based initiative to reduce carbon pollution from power plants, the No. 1 source of carbon pollution across the nation and region. RGGI sets a limit on carbon pollution and lets competition and market forces determine the best way to reduce pollution. Maine is part of RGGI, which has proven to be a great tool for doing our part to cut climate changing pollution, while boosting our economy and jobs and saving money, too.
Studies show that RGGI is one of our most successful climate polices. RGGI has reduced harmful carbon pollution while lowering energy costs and strengthening our overall economy. Since RGGI launched, member states have reduced emissions by 16 percent more than other states and seen 3.6 percent more economic growth. That's something we should be proud of and build on.
One thing that makes RGGI so successful is that Maine uses most of our RGGI-generated funds to invest in energy efficiency improvements for homes and businesses.
Improving energy efficiency is one of the best ways to lower energy costs and pollution. RGGI funding has helped 10,000 homeowners add insulation or improve heating efficiency. RGGI funds have also helped many large facilities reduce energy costs -- from paper mills to hospitals. For some businesses, savings on energy costs have made it possible to weather a recession or keep production in the state.
Another element of RGGI is the agreement between the states to review the program every three years to update and improve it, as needed. That review is happening now and offers important opportunities to make the most of RGGI's success.
Because it is so cost-effective, and helps us lower energy costs, we believe RGGI should be the core part of meeting the region's 2030 carbon pollution reduction target. At each stage, RGGI has proven more successful than expected.
We urge the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to continue to work with other states to set a long-term RGGI carbon cap that would help meet our overall carbon reduction goals and be in line with our rate of progress to date. Since tackling climate change also helps address other challenges Maine faces, such as growing the economy, making energy affordable, and creating jobs for the young people we want and need to inhabit Maine, we can and should find solutions like RGGI that advance multiple goals.
It's good economic policy and the long-term livelihood of our marine economy depends on it.

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it.
The Whitehall is one of the oldest inns in Camden, located on High Street within walking distance of downtown. Two years ago, it was refurbished by Lark Hotels. They kept all the beautiful architectural features of the building and added bright bold colors and modern furniture to update the style of this inn.
I loved the main lobby, a sprawling open space with many sitting areas. The bright artwork and design is well done. I enjoyed the variety of seating, as each piece was different. While savoring my early-morning coffee, I sat in several of the chairs and was pleased to find an ultra-modern one that was extremely comfortable.
Our two-room suite was a large space with a comfortable sitting room and full-size couch, sleek wooden rocker, unique tables and a large flat-screen TV. Gray walls and white trim were the perfect backdrop for bold colors used in the rooms. Comfort is at the forefront here, with a cozy mattress and luxurious linens on the king-size bed.
The Pig and Poet is the public restaurant located at the Whitehall. The bar was made of rows of old wood molding of different styles and colors that, along with the lighting, was a focal point of the room. Wrought iron pipes ending in filament lights squiggle along the ceiling and are as much artwork as they are lighting.
I began my dinner with the roasted asparagus salad plate ($12). Fresh baby greens were topped with chilled roasted asparagus, pickled mushrooms, citrus-roasted carrots, a deviled egg and dressed with tarragon vinaigrette. It was a nice combination of textures, and you could taste the tarragon as well as a light citrus flavor. It was a great way to begin a summer meal.
The food here is described as "modern American," using local fresh ingredients. The chef's creativity shines as one reads through each selection. George's appetizer of heirloom tomato toast ($12) was a great example, combining avocado, lemon aioli and cucumber with those tomatoes.
My entree of shrimp and braised pork ($19) was extraordinary. Cheddar grits were the base, and they were the creamiest grits I'd ever tasted. The well-seasoned shrimp were packed with flavor and so tender. Shredded braised pork added a hint of sweetness and made this famous combination of shrimp and grits a standout. Thinly sliced watermelon radishes made it all look like a piece of artwork. Not many Maine restaurants offer grits, but when they are cooked well, I think they put mac and cheese or potato au gratin to shame.
This was a memorable meal, indeed.
I love history, and sitting at the piano where Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Edna St. Vincent Millay was first discovered in 1912 was a real privilege and pleasure. I appreciate the effort that was made to retain the historic features here, while adding modern comforts.
Jessica at the front desk was friendly and welcoming, and we enjoyed visiting with her throughout our stay.
From the beautiful gardens, to the outside seating, to the lawn games, it's all good. While inside, the Pig and Poet offers a real dining adventure.
Let's begin with breakfast. I was surprised when we entered the restaurant at 8 a.m. to find the bar covered with choices, almost all of which were bite-sized, and I appreciated that because it gave me an opportunity to try almost all of them.
My favorite was the tiny eggs with lobster on top. But everything was good, from the yogurt topped with blueberries to the strawberry smoothie.
Dinner here is special, too, from the raw bar with two oyster dishes, to the hand foods -- small meals and plates. When I saw the porcini gnocchi ($24), it called my name. The dish included locally cultivated mushrooms, English peas, shaved pecorino romano and morel butter creme.
We shared dessert, the chocolate pot de creme: a huge dollop of chocolate surrounded by strawberries. I was delighted when Linda was too full to eat more than a couple of scoops.
After dinner, we sat outside, relaxing in comfortable seats and enjoying a fire. I could almost hear Edna St. Vincent Millay playing the piano.

Full text:   Fishermen seek to turn growing threat to Maine fisheries into marketable solution
A marine biologist, an art conservator and a group of fishermen from Georgetown are trying to use traditional Venetian fishing methods to turn the invasive green crab into a gourmet dish known in Italy as moleche.
Moleche is the name of the young, soft-shelled Venetian crabs that are caught, sorted and held in floating cages and harvested daily, right after they shed their hard outer shell. They are dipped in milk or egg, floured and fried, served up six or eight at a time for about two dozen euros in upscale eateries across the Veneto region of Italy.
Their nearly identical American cousins are reviled in Maine for decimating clam flats and threatening the state's $23 million industry, as well as preying on other mollusks such as mussels and scallops. They can be caught with nets or traps, including the shrimp traps that now lie fallow here in Maine.
The real art of the moleche fishery, however, is about spotting the subtle signs of a molt about to happen in time to catch them before they hide or are eaten by a predator, including their fellow crabs.
Scientists at the University of Maine at Machias had studied the moleche possibility of the green crabs once before, and concluded the crabs did not give any external clues to their molts and thus could not be harvested commercially. But as the invasion marched on, and efforts to eradicate the crab failed, scientists on Prince Edward Island decided to give it a second look. So did marine biologist Marissa McMahan, a Northeastern University doctoral candidate from a Georgetown lobstering family who lives in Phippsburg.
McMahan applied for and got a $3,000 Maine Sea Grant to study the moleche potential. She and Jonathan Taggart, the art conservator who brought the moleche tradition to McMahan's attention, and a small group of Georgetown lobstermen began to trap the green crabs in Robinhood Cove and Five Islands Harbor to collect data on population, size, gender and molting. They were hoping to learn if these two closely related crabs -- same genus, different species -- had enough in common that the Venetian fishery could be duplicated here in Maine.
"There is no one thing that will solve the green crab problem," McMahan said. "But a soft-shell market could, when taken together with other methods, help slow down the population growth of the invasive species, and maybe, over time, give us a new market for Maine fishermen ... to diversify the industry. As a state, we can't just rely on lobster, because a one-fishery market, or economy, is dangerous, especially with the warming ocean temperatures. We may not have a huge impact, not right away at least; but if this works, it would be a step in the right direction."
Originally from Europe, the green crab, or Carcinus maenas, reached America in the mid-1800s after riding across the Atlantic in the ballast water on ships. The crabs have been in Maine for more than a century. They live in the shallows and the soft-bottom and rocky sections of the intertidal zone. As the water temperature rises, the crabs are growing in number. They have been eating their way through East Coast mussels, clams and eelgrass beds, and undermining salt marshes with their labyrinthian tunnels. Over the last decade, efforts to eradicate the invader, through creating bait markets to volunteer and town-funded harvests, have failed.
Despite the crabs' abundance, the Georgetown group quickly learned, like others before them, how difficult it is to identify a pre-molt green crab. Unlike the Chesapeake blue crab, whose swimming fins will turn pink then red as a molt approaches, the green crab's molting signals aren't easy to detect.
That is when Taggart, the Georgetown conservator who had learned about the moleche tradition on a recent trip to document the wooden boat tradition in Venice, agreed to go back to Venice to ask the molecante -- the Italian word for soft-shell green crab fishermen -- for help learning how to sort and cultivate these crabs.
Taggart invited Paolo Tagliapietra, the 36-year-old molecante whom he had met on his trip, to come to Maine to share this centuries-old fishing tradition. One of the youngest crab fishermen in Venice, Tagliapietra is worried the moleche tradition may be fading. The dish remains highly prized, but fewer and fewer young people are joining the ranks of the molecante. And he knows better than most just how much skill, and experience, is needed to identify a pre-molt green crab.
So Tagliapietra bought his own plane ticket to come to Maine to teach what was essentially a two-week crash course on moleche fishing to the Georgetown group as a way to preserve and maybe even expand the molecante tradition and help diversify the Maine fishery.
Tagliapietra said he came here to help his new friend, Taggart, better the lives of local fishermen. Others have asked him to teach them how to fish for the green crab, and he has refused. But as a fisherman, he wouldn't turn away a request to help other fishermen overcome a problem.
And he believes that the moleche tradition, which he learned from his grandfather and father, both of whom spent their whole lives perfecting their skills, could work in Maine.
"I really think that there is the possibility to have soft shell crabs like in Italy," Tagliapietra said. "Probably a simple cut and paste of our technique isn't enough. There are for sure some things to adapt and learn, but the base is the same. (It) is not a start from zero, at all."
The Venetian green crab molting season occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall. Small numbers molt at other times of the year, and those crabs fetch higher prices for the fishermen because of their limited quantity; but it's in March, April, October and November that moleche fetch about $20 a pound in the Venetian fish markets. It is too early to tell if the Maine crabs will follow the same molting season, or if the different length of day and water temperature will alter the shedding calendar slightly for the green crabs that live in Maine.
Tagliapietra taught the group how to spot a pre-molt crab. It isn't molting season now, but every one of the handful of green crabs that Tagliapietra found that he labeled as an out-of-season pre-molt ended up, in a matter of days, emerging from its exoskeleton, clad in a fragile, gelatinous new shell.
It suggests that Maine fishermen, already trained to note small changes in a fishery, could learn to identify pre-molting green crabs, or what Venetians call grancia buono, and catch them before they go into hiding, where their shells will thin, turn gray and be replaced in a day or two.
"We have much to learn and much work to do, but as Paolo says, there is potential." Taggart said.
Young crabs molt more frequently, and are usually greener in color than older crabs, which take on more gray, brown or red hues. According to Tagliapietra, the first signs of molting can occur up to three weeks ahead of time, with a fine white line developing on the edge of the plates found on the underbelly of the crab, followed by a darker shadow. The carapace, or the back of the shell, will begin to gray. The shell will soften, especially where the tail meets the carapace. Then the underside of the body will become opaque. When the crab grows lethargic, molting is imminent.
"The signs can be extremely hard to see in bright sunlight, so they are looked for in the shade," Taggart said. "It helps to wear some good magnifying glasses."
Tagliapietra urged the group to consider building another green crab market, called masanete. These are the pregnant females carrying eggs that can be harvested in the fall. Far easier to identify, they usually are boiled and seasoned with olive oil, parsley and sometimes garlic, and often served over pasta. Harvesting these pregnant females, which can carry up to 185,000 eggs at a time, would cull future generations of this invasive species while providing a diversified source of income for Maine fishermen.
The Georgetown research group is easing up on its sorting work now, and just collects the basic population information from its traps, but will restart the molting work in late September, before the fall shed is likely to begin.

Abstract: MAINE FACES MANY challenges, so I paid attention when I read a news story about a speech to the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce by Sen. Angus King in which he described our five most serious long-term challenges.

Full text:   MAINE FACES MANY challenges, so I paid attention when I read a news story about a speech to the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce by Sen. Angus King in which he described our five most serious long-term challenges.
Today I'll share his list with you and add my comments.
The most serious challenge, according to Angus, is our aging and incomplete infrastructure. Angus noted that many sewer treatment plants are now 40 to 50 years old and must be rebuilt, a very costly process.
But he was not just talking about waste. For instance, the much-written-about but little-done-about lack of broadband internet service in much of Maine, particularly in rural Maine, is a huge problem, leaving us out of the major growth in businesses that rely on broadband -- and that's most businesses these days.
Angus used an example of someone who was considering the purchase of a home, but then is told they'd never have broadband. Sort of like telling them it's a great home and community, but they'll never have running water, he said.
And while we're on the subject of water, I'd add the challenges we face with lead or other chemicals in too many water sources. Clean water needs more attention, for sure.
Up next on Angus's list was climate change, which he noted is killing shellfish and moving lobsters further east on the coast.
I've been writing and talking about climate change for quite a while now, and there is some serious work being done on the topic here in Maine. But we're not close to solving this monumental problem, which, I am afraid, we are leaving to our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to deal with. I'm also afraid they won't look on us very kindly for ignoring the problem and failing to resolve it.
Typical of Angus, he did see some positive news in climate change, noting that the melting of the polar ice caps has opened up northern international shipping routes, which Maine is positioned to capitalize on. Yes, Angus, that's true, and I guess those ships will be able to dock on Congress Street in Portland, after Commercial Street is flooded by the rising ocean tides.
I totally agree with Angus's third challenge: lack of diversity in Maine energy sources. He rightly reported that energy costs are not the issue, lack of diversity is the problem.
I've written before that Maine could be energy independent, using wood, wind, water and the sun, but we are far from that goal today. Just think what it could mean for our state, which spends the most on fossil fuels of any state in the country. Angus also thinks that reliance on natural gas would be a mistake, good advice as we ask taxpayers to pay for expanded natural gas lines into Maine.
I've been involved in issues in the northern forest for decades, and Angus raised a concern about the closure of paper mills and the decline in the market for timber.
He rightly focused on making new products with our trees, something the forest industry -- led by the Maine Forest Products Council -- is deeply involved in. My friends at MFPC are optimistic about the future of forest products jobs and the industry, and I sure hope they are right.
This issue reminded me of something Angus said when he was governor: "No fish should leave the state with its head on." Yes, let's process our fish, and our fiber, right here in Maine, and stop exporting so many of our trees.
You may know that the federal government has essentially declared our forest products industry a disaster, and sent a special team to Maine to address the state's forest-based economic challenges. This includes an investment of millions of dollars in rural Maine communities, good news for sure, but a sad recognition of how much trouble we are really in.
The fifth challenge cited by Angus hit close to home with me: the aging workforce and population decline. Angus called this "a negative demographic time bomb."
At 67 years of age, and semi-retired, I look around me and see -- mostly -- a lot of people older than me. Two of our three kids are living out of state, where economic opportunities are so much better.
"How old is Maine?" Angus asked. And answering his own question he noted, "We're so old, our junior senator is 72."
I was pleased to see that Angus agrees with me on another issue. Immigrants are bringing -- and must be allowed to continue to bring -- economic vitality to our state.

Full text:   Micah Davis, co-pilot of the Portland-based Amhas II sailing racer, which took part Friday and Saturday in the Atlantic Cup races in Portland Harbor, says it is much more thrilling competing inshore than offshore.
The 40-foot-long Class 40s -- the monohull boats used in the race -- are designed for straight-shot trans-Atlantic racing, said Davis, a Harpswell native.
Davis is a member of one of the nine teams from six countries that competed in the 1,048-mile biennial event, which took the boats from Charleston, South Carolina, to Brooklyn, New York, and from Brooklyn to Portland.
The two days of racing by seven boats -- two boats dropped out after the first two legs -- around Portland Harbor were more exciting to watch and to compete in than the sailing out at sea, Davis said.
"It is gassing along at 14 knots and you are 14 inches away from another boat going that fast with lots of buoys and other boats," he said. "This inshore racing in many respects is the hardest and an instantaneous thrill."
Davis, who lives in San Francisco and manages a global natural resources fund, co-owns the boat with Maine Yacht Center general manager Brian Harris.
A crowd gathered Saturday at the Race Village festival set up at Fort Allen Park on the Eastern Promenade to watch the final two of five inshore races. Emcee Dave Rearick, a former Atlantic Cup winner, provided commentary while the boats jockeyed for position at the starting line off Fort Gorges.
"They can't cross that line until the gun goes off. It's a game of inches," said Rearick, noting that one bad bump can cost the boat owner several thousand dollars in repair bills.
The boats were vying for the $5,000 cash prize awarded to the winner of each leg of the race.
The Spanish boat Tales II and the Earendil of France took first and second place, respectively, in the Atlantic Cup after the competition ended Saturday in Portland. The two boats led the pack by a large margin before the last two inshore races Saturday. Oakcliff, a boat homeported in Oyster Bay, New York, took third place overall.
Tales II won both offshore legs and Earendil was second in those legs, giving both boats a big lead heading into the inshore races in Portland. Tales II ended up winning two of those five inshore races, and finished second, third and fourth in the others. Earendil won one inshore leg and finished second, fourth twice and fifth in the others.
Oakcliff took third on a tie-breaker with a boat called Toothface.
"We are really thrilled about winning the Atlantic Cup," said Gonzalo Botín, who skippered Tales II with Palbo Santurde. "The combination of offshore and inshore racing made it exciting and challenging, but we are really happy with the end result."
Davis said it is wild racing in Portland Harbor, where the waters are constantly churned by pleasure boats, fishing boats and ferries.
"Everyone has been really accommodating. We appreciate ferries doing figure eights to keep out of our way," Davis said.
The crowd at Fort Allen Park was filled with boating enthusiasts, including Dhara Williams and her husband, Mike Shuman. The Portland couple said they wanted to get a bird's-eye view of the races rather than watch from their 28-foot sloop.
Shuman said the Atlantic Cup, which came to Portland for the first time this year, makes perfect sense for the city. He said he hopes the event returns to Portland in 2018. Atlantic Cup officials are expected to decide on that in the next three months.
"A lot of people come here for the ocean," said Shuman.

Crabs threaten young soft-shell clams

Abstract: While some shellfish managers say clam populations have rebounded thanks to a few cold winters that killed off green crabs, harvesters are anxious that the mild winter this year could produce a resurgence of green crabs and throw the fragile industry into a tailspin. The soft-shell clam industry was thrown into turmoil four or five years ago, when an army of European green crabs, bolstered by unusually warm water, overtook the intertidal zone, devouring juvenile mussels and clams and destroying hundreds of acres of marine eelgrass, critical habitat for shellfish larva.

Full text:   Soft-shell clams are a summer tradition around Casco Bay, both for the tourists and residents who love steamers and for the clam diggers who turn long, backbreaking hours on the mud flats into cold, hard cash.
But an infestation of invasive green crabs ravaged juvenile clam stocks in the past four years, adding to ecological changes, competition for coastal access and other pressures facing the state's second-most-valuable fishery. Clam landings in the Casco Bay communities of Freeport, Harpswell and Brunswick, some of the state's leading clam producers, plummeted to historic lows in 2015, and the scarcity of soft-shell clams contributed to all-time high prices.
While some shellfish managers say clam populations have rebounded thanks to a few cold winters that killed off green crabs, harvesters are anxious that the mild winter this year could produce a resurgence of green crabs and throw the fragile industry into a tailspin.
Those fears have clam diggers and scientists stepping up efforts to defend clam beds with boxes and nets. And they are fueling calls for a sea change in the management of soft-shell clams by leasing clam beds so that clammers can better protect the resource from predators.
Some are sounding alarms that without human intervention, the resource faces total collapse.
"Unfortunately, it doesn't look like people are just going to be able to go out and dig clams like they have without the protection element," said Sara Randall, a Freeport researcher working with clammers in that town.
Others worry about an overreaction. Although most agree that active management and conservation efforts will be required in the future, not all believe the industry is facing a doomsday.
"We realize there is a bunch going on, but we don't see it as the end of wild harvest," said Darcie Couture, a marine scientist working with Harpswell clammers.
In 2015, soft-shell clams were the state's second-most-valuable fishery after lobsters. Maine fishermen landed about 9 million pounds of clams, worth $22.5 million.
The volume of the catch was far smaller than the 20 million to 40 million pounds dug out of the mud each year in the 1970s and '80s. However, the statewide value of the harvest last year was the highest since the state began keeping records in the 1950s because of a dramatic jump in wholesale prices. The average price per pound jumped 47 cents over the previous year, to $2.46, more than a dollar increase from 10 years ago.
While that seems like a windfall, scarcity drove the price spike. Clammers weren't bringing in enough marketable clams to meet demand, said Dan Devereaux, Brunswick's Marine Resources Officer.
Far from being seen as a boon to the industry, the high prices were a red flag.
"The fact that they are getting such high prices is alarming, because it signals the scarcity is at a point now where there is not enough clams to meet demand," Couture said.
And while the statewide sales revenue grew last year, the cash flow continued to plummet for clammers in the Casco Bay area.
Freeport clammers landed 288,000 pounds of clams in 2015, compared to more than 939,000 pounds just three years earlier, a 70 percent decline. Despite the higher prices, revenue plummeted too. The value of Freeport clams was $782,655 last year, half of the value of the 2012 harvest, according to Department of Marine Resources records.
S&S Seafood, one of Freeport's only wholesale clam purchasers, closed its doors last year, citing a drop in business.
"The infrastructure is starting to shrivel now because there is not enough production," said Walt Coffin, a Freeport clammer.

The soft-shell clam industry was thrown into turmoil four or five years ago, when an army of European green crabs, bolstered by unusually warm water, overtook the intertidal zone, devouring juvenile mussels and clams and destroying hundreds of acres of marine eelgrass, critical habitat for shellfish larva. Within three months in 2011, juvenile clam stocks in Brunswick were decimated, according to Devereaux.
For the next four years, communities invested in predator control and resource protection efforts, shielding clam beds with protective netting and trapping crabs by the millions. Those efforts were aided by back-to-back frigid winters that killed off cold-sensitive crabs.
Although the crab population was knocked down, it wasn't knocked out. Green crabs, which are native to Europe, have been in Maine waters for more than 100 years. In the 1950s, unusually warm temperature also led to a green crab infestation that devastated the soft-shell clam industry until a series of cold winters killed off the crabs.
But with the effects of climate change and a general warming of Maine winters, clammers shouldn't expect annual cold snaps to stave off crab outbreaks in the future, according to Randall.
"The difference between now and back in the 1950s is that we are on a predicted warming track," she said.
Warnings that the Gulf of Maine is on track for another "ocean heat wave" in 2016 -- on par with the high temperatures in 2012 that boosted the green crab population -- are contributing to that anxiety.
Green crabs are not the only predator expected to compete for the clams this season.
Huge numbers of milky ribbon worms, a native species that preys on adult clams, started showing up in mudflats in the past two or three years. The worms can grow to 4 feet long and attack clams through their exposed feet, then devour the entire animal and leave behind an empty shell.
Ian Anderson, the marine resources officer in Scarborough, said clammers started seeing worms for the first time last summer, and it has been a serious concern for the town's 35 commercial harvesters. Scientists don't yet have a clear explanation for the sudden appearance of the worms, let alone any solution to the problem.
"There are guys that have lived in town and dug clams for 35 to 40 years that have never seen them until last year," Anderson said. There is no way to trap the worms and they can tunnel through the mud underneath protective netting for green crabs.
Even if worms are impossible to trap, there may be ways to shelter clams from them.
Brian Beal, a shellfish biology expert from the University of Maine at Machias, is convinced predation is to blame for the decline of soft-shell clams in the Casco Bay region. Beal has run trapping and protection experiments in Freeport since 2013.
Last year, Beal, working with Freeport clammers, installed more than 500 wooden frames covered with different gauge of plastic and wire mesh. The "Beal boxes" are designed so clam larvae floating in the water column can colonize inside the walls where predators can't reach them. At the end of last season, some of the boxes were teeming with young clams, mussels and other species, and about 6,000 immature clams settled in a single box. Nothing was growing in the mud just outside the boxes, Beal said. That proves that while there were plenty of clam larvae, or seed, in the water, only juveniles protected by the boxes survived.
"That is an amazing demonstration of predation," Beal said.
From the results of his multi-year study, Beal believes that the way forward for clam harvesters is to protect the resource actively using devices like the boxes in privately leased aquaculture sites, or clam farms.
"If you are going to farm clams, you need to have seed," Beal said. "This is a way to explore, 'Do I need to buy seed from a lab, or can I rely on nature?'"
Chad Coffin, a Freeport clammer and head of the Maine Clammers Association, works with Beal and agrees that the future of clamming is hands-on stewardship of the resource through aquaculture.
"We can't trap our way out of the problem with crabs," Coffin said. "The overall message is that we have to find solutions, find practical applications and adapt to changes," he said.
Part of the challenge is a matter of resources, Devereaux said.
Even though Freeport, Harpswell and Brunswick have strong, funded municipal shellfish programs, the money it will take to protect an entire town's clam resource just isn't there. Instead, farmers could finance their own clam farms, which would strengthen clam populations across Casco Bay.
"If you allow individuals to have farms complementary to the municipal program, it will act as a spawning ground for the rest of the region," Devereaux said. It's an approach also championed by Coffin, and is being tried out by a farmer in Georgetown.
But for some, the idea of privatizing historically public clam flats is controversial, and Coffin said a proposed farm in Freeport has run into opposition from shorefront property owners who don't like the appearance of nets and boxes on the flats.
In Harpswell, clammers are looking at collective municipal aquaculture, even though the Department of Marine Resources previously turned down a similar proposal.
Not everyone agrees predation is the primary cause of declining clam populations.
A 2015 study by the environmental group Friends of Casco Bay found that highly acidic mud flats, partially the result of rising temperature in the Gulf of Maine, damaged young clam shells and threatened their survival.
Couture, who works in Harpswell, said while predation from crabs and worms is a problem, other challenges are facing the resource, including ocean acidification and use of the clam flats by bloodworm harvesters, who she said disturb sensitive clam-seeding grounds.
"I think there are multiple factors stressing the natural resource. In some areas it is one thing; in other areas it is another thing," she said. "I do not believe that predation is the be-all-end-all of stresses on this resource."
There also isn't consensus, even within struggling Casco Bay, on whether the industry is in crisis.
Devereaux, from Brunswick, said the population of harvest-sized clams available now is stronger than it has been in years, which could mean a bumper crop this summer. That may be in part because the current crop of clams was able to mature while the green crab population was contained by the severity of winters past.
Brunswick clammers also are diversifying by digging quahogs and razor clams, which are less threatened by predation, he added.
"I don't think the shellfish industry is in a crisis, but soft-shell clams are more susceptible to these changes than other species," he said.
Regardless of disagreements over the cause or severity of the problem, there is a general understanding that soft-shell clams need careful attention and resources to remain sustainable.
"It is a resource that has reached a point where it has to be managed very carefully and looked after," said Anderson, the marine resources officer in Scarborough.
"It's still a viable industry."

Full text:   IT STARTED WITH Atlantic salmon hatcheries in the late 1800s, and today aquaculture is one of Maine's best stories, growing rapidly and helping us transition from an economy dependent on wild fish to one that grows those fish and other ocean products in pens.
If you've ever enjoyed mussels grown on those farms in the Damariscotta River, your mouth may be watering now like mine is. Those farms have recently added seaweed to their crops, something that has taken off as a food additive.
A lot of our farms were started by young people, what Sebastian Belle calls the "Blue Revolution," kids eager to spend their lives outdoors, where they started with oysters. Today Maine has more than 60 oyster farms.
I sat with Sebastian, the executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, for nearly two hours recently as he told me fascinating stories about this amazing industry. Sebastian worked in the aquaculture industry in Norway for 10 years, grew salmon in Maine, and has spent his career working in all aspects of aquaculture, giving him a great understanding of the industry he now represents.
I have one aquaculture story of my own. One year, the federal government ordered Maine's aquaculture industry to rid itself of the Atlantic salmon it was growing, fearing they would escape and breed with the wild salmon the feds have been working -- unsuccessfully -- to restore to Maine's rivers for decades.
Initially the salmon were going to be killed and buried in a landfill. But then I got an invitation to fish for them, in the pens, and it didn't take long to say yes.
I took several trips to the pens, with friends, standing on the outer rim of the pens and fishing for those salmon. Well, it wasn't really fishing, it was catching. I can't even begin to explain the excitement of seeing a 35-pound salmon rising up out of the depths of the pen to grab my lure.
Some of my friends made fun of this until I took them along, and then they begged to return. I brought home coolers full of salmon and shared the fillets with family, friends and neighbors. And later, the remaining salmon were given to our Native Americans, so none was wasted. The company even hosted a few paying guests, anglers who traveled here from out of state, spent lots of money, and enjoyed catching those fish.
Today, a different strain of salmon, provided by the government, is being grown in vastly improved pens, with lots of scrutiny to assure they don't escape. It took three years of hard work to revive the salmon industry, with leadership from folks including Des FitzGerald of Duck Trap Farms as well as our environmental organizations, a "good example of how to work together," notes Sebastian.
There are many good stories about enterprising folks who built this successful industry in Maine. Glenn Cooke, of Cooke Aquaculture, would be one. He started with a single cage and now is one of the largest aquaculture businesses in the world. His family, which reaches into New Brunswick, "took a leap of faith," says Sebastian, buying leases and a processing plant in Machiasport. "They deserve great credit," he said.
I was particularly fascinated by the new management system they've created, called "all in, all out." They stock all their salmon pens one year, harvest the fish in two years, and leave the pens empty the year after, which reduces the ability of pathogens to attack the fishery.
Glenn's beautiful salmon run 10 to 12 pounds and he's started branding them as "Maine salmon," which allows him to charge a higher price. When he raised the price for his "Maine salmon," sales actually increased.
At Hannaford, the price for his salmon went up $3 per pound, while his competitors lowered their price by $1 per pound, and still his sales increased. "We have a brand that works," said Sebastian.
Maine mussels and oysters now claim a price 20 percent higher than anyone else's. Our cold, clean water and longer shelf life delivers higher-quality products, and people are willing to pay for that.
One of the best parts of this story is how Maine commercial fishermen and their kids who couldn't get commercial fishing permits started farming their ocean products with great success. Everything is going in the right direction for us, including the "foodie" movement and development of new products, especially in seaweed. We now have seven farms growing seaweed.
Ocean Approved in Portland is supplying dried seaweed to health food stores and created a kelp pasta that is gluten free. Coming soon: a kelp cube for milkshakes and smoothies. "Kelp is the new kale," Sebastian told me.
Now, aren't you hungry?

Full text:   THE RECENT STORY on a proposal to limit the use of synthetic pesticides in South Portland ("Plan to ban pesticides: A model or a mistake?", April 11) offers an overview of the differing perspectives on proposed pesticide ordinances. It also raises the significant issue of how both federal and state agencies are not doing enough to ensure that commonly used lawn and garden products are safe.
But this is just one part of a larger and much more ominous problem: the failure over decades of state and federal government to protect citizens from the short- and long-term risks of exposure to literally thousands of hazardous chemicals all around us.
Toxicity to children (and, to a greater extent, dogs) from lawn and garden pesticides is just one aspect of the danger. Tons of widely used chemicals such as glyphosate, the active ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup and nitrogen-rich fertilizers eventually reach Casco Bay, contributing to overgrowth of green algae and mass die-offs of phytoplankton, which can adversely affect fish and shellfish. Growing public concern surrounds the use of neonicitinoid pesticides, which are closely linked with declining numbers of bees and other pollinating insects, bats and other species further up the food chain.
The 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act, a federal law conceded to have been largely shaped by the chemical industry, has been a toothless, sleeping watchdog. During the past 40 years, it is estimated that over 80,000 synthetic chemicals have entered into widespread use in industry, household products, personal care items and myriad other uses; newer chemicals are being added at an estimated rate of over 700 per year. Only a small fraction have been adequately tested and even fewer are adequately targeted by meaningful restrictions or outright bans on their use.
Alarmingly, widespread testing of umbilical cord blood reveals that is possible to detect over 200 synthetically produced chemicals and their breakdown products. In adults, evidence of these same chemicals can also be found in blood, urine, semen and other body fluids.
A wide spectrum of problems are correlated with exposure to synthesized chemical toxins, as well as to many other substances long recognized as harmful, such as lead, mercury, arsenic, dioxin and radon. Many public health experts attribute the rising incidence of various cancers, infertility, birth defects, lowered IQ, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and behavior and learning problems to increasing exposure to the toxins that are everywhere in our environment.
Children are more vulnerable to any type of poisoning than are adults, because of their higher metabolism and respiratory rate, greater surface-to-mass ratio and the tendency for toddlers to crawl across lawns and floors, mouthing whatever they think looks interesting. There are also critical periods in utero and during early childhood when their developing nervous systems are more vulnerable to disruptive influences.
Moreover, their longer lifespan means children may continue to accumulate toxic chemicals in their bodies far longer than adults. The presence of even small amounts of endocrine-disrupting chemicals at critical periods of embryonic development may contribute to birth defects in male genitals, and possibly later infertility or other reproductive problems. Such long-term adverse effects escape detection during short-term testing.
Research has shown a clear connection between exposure to some of these hormone-mimicking chemicals and marked obesity in rats raised on the same diet as matched controls, suggesting that environmental toxins - as well as more obvious factors such as overeating and inactivity -- may be insidious contributors to the current national epidemic of obesity.
Bills intended to replace the Toxic Substances Control Act have been put forward in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, with conference committees now working to integrate these into a meaningful bipartisan consensus. Inevitably, chemical industry lobbyists will be attempting to weaken or dilute any final version. It is thus a crucial time for our congressional delegation to hear from Maine citizens and environmental groups seeking stronger protective action.
When writing or calling the offices of our senators and representatives, urge their support for provisions in any new chemical legislation that will:
[bullet] Compel the Environmental Protection Agency to identify and test significant numbers of "chemicals of high concern" (chemicals proven to cause serious health concerns) within a specific time frame.
[bullet] Ensure that the language of any new legislation does not effectively invalidate safeguards already in place in Maine and other states with progressive toxic control laws (such as the Kid-Safe Product Act, banning bisphenol-A in child products).

Full text:   CUMBERLAND -- Town officials in Cumberland are planning to spray pesticides to slow down an infestation of browntail moths that is expected to cause skin rashes and respiratory problems in more than a dozen communities this summer.
Town officials plan to spray pesticide along a three-mile stretch of Foreside Road within the next few weeks to kill browntail moth caterpillars just as they come out of their winter cocoons and begin to feed on new leaves.
The invasive species can cause skin rashes and respiratory issues in humans and defoliate native hardwood trees. A state scientist warns the caterpillars are more abundant now than they have been in a decade. Cumberland officials hope that confronting the moths now could limit the impacts by preventing the infestation from spreading further into town.
"It's almost like a fire line if you will, to keep them from marching inland," said Town Manager William Shane.
For the spraying to be effective, however, the town needs Foreside homeowners to allow its contractor to spray onto their properties. Most residents appear to be on board with the program, although some people are uncomfortable with using a pesticide treatment, officials said.
"I am not 100 percent for spraying, but when it comes to this, there is no alternative," said Tom Gruber, a town councilor who has lived on Foreside Road for more than 30 years.
"The more residents that opt in for spraying, the more likely the chances are that we can stop this invasion," Gruber said.
Cumberland is the only community planning to address the issue with pesticides, although it is only one of more than a dozen towns and cities that are at risk of moths this year, according to the Maine Forest Service.
Coastal communities north and south of Portland and as far east as Boothbay are at moderate risk of moths. The epicenter of high risk is the area between Freeport, Harpswell, Woolwich and Bowdoinham. Although moths have typically been a coastal problem, the population during this outbreak stretches as far inland as Turner, Waterville and Winslow.
Browntail moths were introduced to the U.S. more than 150 years ago and are located only in coastal southern Maine and on Cape Cod. The population usually stays at a low enough level that it isn't a problem, but periodic infestations can last for years and spread far from coastal areas, said Charlene Donahue, an entomologist with the Maine Forest Service.
The reason for population surges is poorly understood because there is no good scientific research on the moths. But visual surveys of winter webs in the past two years suggest that this current infestation is the worst in more than a decade, Donahue said.
Moth caterpillars nest by the hundreds in winter webs, clusters that look like bunches of dead leaves often located in Oak and Apple trees. Seriously affected areas can have tens of thousands of webs. An aerial survey of infested areas last autumn showed serious defoliation in trees that were starting to shed their leaves, caused by tiny caterpillars before they nest for the winter, Donahue said.
"I was shocked to see how much damage there was in the fall," Donahue said. "We haven't seen that kind of damage in 15 years or so."
Browntail moths harm trees, but the leading concern is the health effects they have on humans.
Browntail caterpillars are covered in microscopic poisonous hairs that cause a severe rash similar to poison ivy and can lead to respiratory problems for some people. Caterpillars will shed the poisonous skin five times over the spring, and the hairs drift around and can get on exposed skin and even saturate clothing drying outside. The toxins in the hairs take up to three years to break down, which means they stay in the environment and affect people months after caterpillars are gone, Donahue said.
"Just being in the area can give you a rash," Donahue said.
The outbreak 15 years ago was so severe that some coastal communities coordinated a regional aerial pesticide spray to cut back the insect population. That program became controversial, partially because of concern that widespread use of pesticide could harm lobsters and other shellfish. The infestation was finally tempered by several years of wet, cool springs that produced a tree fungus that decimated the moth population. Without a similar fungus, the infestation could continue for years, Donahue said.
Targeted pesticide spraying such as the effort in Cumberland can limit moths locally, but won't have an impact on the broader problem, Donahue said.
"Realistically, what this mostly will provide is relief from the rash. It is doubtful it will really suppress the population," she said.
Cumberland plans to use truck-mounted sprays to treat areas between 250 and 500 feet in from Foreside Road. Terry Traver, a licensed pesticide applicator with Whitney Tree Service, said the chemical his company uses, Tempo, is approved by the state, but he appreciates that some people may be uncomfortable with spraying an area with chemicals. Whitney is the company the town is contracting with to spray.
"We're just trying to suppress it in some of the public areas," he said.
Pesticide is only effective when caterpillars are feeding on treated leaves, so that means the treatment has to be applied in the next few weeks just as caterpillars are breaking out of their winter webs to eat new leaves.
That leaves the town only a couple of weeks to get the buy-in from Foreside residents to spray as much of the area as it can.

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it in their own personal style.
Whenever someone wants to meet with me in the Portland area, I insist on getting together in my "Portland office," a corner booth by the window at Hot Suppa! on the west end of Congress Street. So of course, when Linda and I decided to start this Let's Do Lunch series, Hot Suppa! was at the top of our list for a visit.
The small, cozy dining area is inviting with a small bar, booths along one wall and three larger tables along the picture windows looking out on the street. A huge chalk board on the back wall lists the day's specials and brews -- always with a good choice of Maine microbrews.
For lunch I enjoyed an Oxbow Farmhouse Ale while Linda had an Allagash White. We'd spent the morning at the Maine Restaurant Association's Expo, where food tempted us at many booths. OK, tempted me. But Linda insisted we not eat anything there, so I only got a few nibbles when she wasn't looking.
That was actually a good thing, because portions at Hot Suppa! are large. We started with a side order of fried green tomatoes, a favorite anytime we are here.
The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch items all day until dinner when a very creative menu takes over for the evening. My favorite lunch items are the BLT and Cubano, and Lin ordered the BLT on this visit, making my choice easy. The Cubano is a Cuban-style pork and ham sandwich with gruyere, brown mustard and cornichion pickles on a toasted French bread ($11). Yummy doesn't begin to describe it.
Our server, Rebecca, has been here a long time and is both friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and all things Portland. Both Mo Sabina, the chef, and his brother Alec, the manager, have become friends of ours and spent quite a bit of time visiting with us that day. They grew up in Gorham and are hard workers. It's great to see them succeed and prosper.
Alec's significant other, Angela Ferrari, a Farmington native, has filled the walls with her stunning works of art, all for sale at reasonable prices. It's a real pleasure to enjoy that art during your meal. I've had lunch with lots of people here, and they all became regular customers. You should, too.
The first time I tasted Hot Suppa!'s fried green tomatoes I fell in love. They are double battered before being fried, and the batter is well-seasoned. Once cooked, the crusty outside combines perfectly with the soft, tangy tomato inside. Their addictive remoulade of mayonnaise, capers, cilantro and a dash of hot sauce (with some other spice I can't quite figure out) has me craving these often.
George has finally understood that when he goes to Portland and has lunch there, he is to bring home an order of fried green tomatoes for me. When I go there for lunch, I lean toward the Fried Green Tomato BLT.
The southern cooking influence really shows up on the dinner menu -- from chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits to oysters and pork belly with red beans and rice. Mo went to school in the South and fell in love with the food. Now he serves it right here in Maine.

It was a very long winter for me. Mount Vernon's cafe was closed in January and February for renovations. No place to go for those great breakfasts. No place to hang out with friends and neighbors. No place for lunch. I was so happy when they reopened.
While it is true that I have been known to have breakfast here and still be at the cafe when lunchtime rolls around, I am more apt to come for lunch. And if anyone wants to meet with me in this area, I insist on doing that at the cafe.
Chef/owner Sarah Chaisson is a great cook, and after I had one particular sandwich about a hundred times, she named it after me, calling it the Gorgeous George. But to be humble, I asked her to change that to the George. It's a pulled-pork sandwich in a wrap, and it is so good. Even if it isn't on the menu, they can usually make it for me.
Haddock chowder on Fridays is another favorite. Linger at a window seat and enjoy the view of the lake, or sit on the porch in summertime and watch the fast-moving stream rushing by just beyond the screen. I love the art here, which rotates every month. The staff is wonderful and so are the customers. Be ready to say "hi" and visit with us.
My favorite sandwich at The Post Office Cafe keeps calling my name. It is the Californian, a panini of turkey, avocado, red onions, cheese and mayonnaise. The soups here are always good, and then there is the cilantro coleslaw. Everything here is fresh and delicious. It's a great cafe and draws customers from all over Maine.

Full text:   This package will contain all letters to the editor that are awaiting editing and headlines.
Midcoast Conservancy is a regional conservation organization that works in an interconnected way to protect vital lands, trails, waterways and water quality in the midcoast region. The recent temperate winter has stunted the regular winter activity we normally see at our premier recreation venue, Hidden Valley Nature Center in Jefferson.
Along with a host of normal programming cancellations, the fifth annual Liberal Cup Biathlon was postponed and ultimately cancelled because of lack of snow. In its place, the Nature Center hosted a winter open house with mountain biking and trail running, which attracted 150 attendees, only half as many people as were expected for the biathlon. The Nature Center also saw a remarkable decline in rentals of back-country huts, which make winter camping accessible to young families.
The health of our lakes and rivers, as well as our economy, is at risk with the impacts of climate change. Rain events throughout the winter season washed pollutants into our waterways that would otherwise have been reduced by vegetation. Road sands from winter maintenance washed directly into streams and rivers, contributing to algae blooms and ocean acidification. Northeast municipalities must also consider the impacts of more frequent and intense rain events on their stormwater systems, planning and budgeting to improve the capacity and effectiveness of their aging infrastructure.
These impacts to our water resources have long-reaching effects, impacting Maine's shellfish and marine fisheries, in attracting tourism to the state, and the high values we place on recreation and enjoyment of the outdoors. Clearly, climate change is threatening Maine's traditional industries and our recovering economy. We strongly support the EPA's Clean Power Plan and thank Sen. Susan Collins heartily for her support of the plan in Congress, as well as Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree.

Full text:   SCARBOROUGH -- The town clerk's office closed Tuesday and Steve Snow hadn't shown.
One of 30 residents who hold commercial shellfish licenses, Snow had started working as a merchant mariner and had plans to move to Florida, people had heard.
So when his license came up for its annual renewal this week, he let it lapse -- leaving behind a way to change someone's life.
There's no limit to how long Scarborough residents can hold on to their shellfish licenses, and many who are lucky enough to land them keep them for the rest of their lives, or at least as long as they can do the work.
About half of the license holders dig clams full time, some as often as seven days a week, said Robert Willette, chairman of the town's Shellfish Conservation Commission and one of the lucky license holders.
Others, like him, cobble together a living between clamming and other jobs. Willette does carpentry and works on cars, on top of spending five days a week on the flats.
The hours of the profession depend on the tides. It's feasible to dig from about three hours before low tide to three hours after, said Willette. The time of day when that occurs can affect how many clams diggers can collect, since they're restricted to digging between half an hour before sunrise and half an hour after sunset, he said.
Willette said that even for those who dig clams every day, their annual income would fall far short of six figures.
Tody Justice, the town clerk of more than 20 years, remembers lotteries for shellfish licenses when people lined up out the door. She doesn't remember a time when Snow wasn't one of the people who held one.
Although two came up for grabs last year, it's unusual for a commercial license to become available two years in a row, and it's usually much longer between lotteries, Justice said.
On Friday afternoon, 13 Scarborough residents showed up at the clerk's office for a chance at the single license, although about 40 people were there all together, including children and teenagers who hoped to get one of two student licenses that had become available.
Twelve-year-old Nolan Orff wanted to be able to go out with his older brother, who already has a student license, and make some money to start saving for college.
Their father, Chris Orff, a Portland firefighter, applied for the commercial license so he could go with them.
They weren't the only applicants who were related. Twenty-something siblings Sarah and Casey Violette, whose father is a commercial fisherman, were both hoping for the opportunity to have a bigger hand in the family business.
Then there was 55-year-old Nancy Rodoalph, whose job making pizza and sandwiches at a local convenience store doesn't bring in enough income. She moved from Cape Cod, where she cleaned houses, to her sister and brother-in-law's house in Scarborough a couple of years ago, hoping there would be more work opportunities here.
Her sister's husband, David Green, who has a commercial shellfish license, hoped she'd win because he didn't think she'd end up using it, he said, and there's already enough competition on the flats.
After checking into the clerk's office, each applicant watched a small strip of paper with their name printed on it get placed in a basket with others of the exact same size, folded in the same way.
Justice has been accused of fixing the lottery before, so she makes sure that everything is precise -- and she doesn't pick the winner.
That job has been taken over by Colette Mathieson, the town manager's executive assistant.
The applicants, along with their friends and family members, were lined up along a wall in the Scarborough Municipal Building when Justice came out of the clerk's office with the basket in her hand and Mathieson by her side.
"Drum roll," Mathieson said before reaching into the basket and selecting a paper strip.
It was Rodoalph. Her niece Jessica Holbrook laughed.
Green had gotten his wish.

Full text:   Record warmth has officials worried Gulf of Maine may suffer
With the United States coming off the warmest winter on record, scientists are monitoring the Gulf of Maine for a possible repeat of an "ocean heat wave" four years ago that led to the destruction of clam populations, a collapse of Maine lobster prices, and incursions of warm-water species such as squid and blue crabs into Maine bays.
"We're pretty much locked in now to 2012-like conditions," says Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland. "If you look at the temperatures right now in the Gulf of Maine, these are the temperatures you expect to see in mid-April, and it seems we've really stopped cooling."
"If it's like 2012, temperatures will hover for a few weeks and then really pick up," he added.
Pershing, who has been monitoring buoy and satellite data as part of a lobster forecasting project, expects 2012-like phenomena this year: an explosion of clam-eating green crabs, lobsters molting extremely early, and sightings of mid-Atlantic species. He was the lead author in a scientific study published in the journal Science last October that suggested the warming gulf was a major factor in the failure of cod populations to recover despite fishing restrictions.
Glen Gawarkiewicz, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said that as of a week ago the water temperature recorded at a key offshore measuring buoy on the Nantucket Shoals at the southern edge of the Gulf was 44.1 degrees, just 0.7 degrees cooler than the same day in 2012.
"We have passed the worst of the cooling season in winter, so I would not expect big temperature drops at this point," he says. "I think there is a strong possibility that the temperatures this summer will be comparable, and possibly slightly below that of 2012."
This winter was the warmest in the U.S. since records began 121 years ago, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with Maine and the other five New England states breaking their individual all-time average winter temperature records, the only states in the country to do so. Maine and Massachusetts were the only states in the country to also break their records for the highest single winter temperature reading.
But Nick Record, a research scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay, says he's not certain the warming trend is set in stone. A cooler-than-average spring and early summer could prevent a recurrence of an "ocean heat wave" like that in 2012, which triggered an explosion of clam-eating green crabs and caused lobsters to shed so early in the season they disrupted lobster markets. (Disclosure: This reporter is a Bigelow trustee.)
"It's more likely at this point that we'd have a warm summer and a heat wave than in a typical year, but it isn't guaranteed," Record says. "But if we did have another year that's off the charts, it's important for us to carefully observe what happens because we're one of the first parts of the world ocean to have gone through these really rapid changes."
Record has been crowd-sourcing observations of unusual species, especially jellyfish, but also squid eggs and other phenomena, emailed to him by Maine residents (jellyfish@bigelow.org) in an effort to get as many eyes on the changes that occur when gulf water temperatures spike.
During the winter of 2011-2012, unusually warm temperatures caused the gulf to never properly cool down, and things warmed further through the summer, sending shock waves throughout the ecosystem.
Lobstermen started catching mounds of newly shed lobsters in May, six weeks ahead of their usual schedule, creating a glut that threw off the overwhelmed Maritime Canadian processing plants that usually purchase most of these fragile softshells, which aren't hardy enough for the live whole lobster trade. Prices fell so low the processors eventually jumped in, buying up the glut of cheap Maine lobsters instead of local lobsters, prompting eastern New Brunswick lobstermen to blockade trucks of Maine lobsters to prevent them from unloading.
On Eastern Egg Rock, puffin chicks starved because their parents were unable to find appropriate food for them, while off Grand Manan Island, northern right whales failed to find swarms of the tiny, cold-dependent marine copeods they like to eat.
Meanwhile, the warmer water triggered an explosion in the population of green crabs, which proceeded to devour most of the clams in Freeport, Brunswick, Penobscot and other towns.
Brian Beal, a marine shellfish ecologist at the University of Maine at Machias and the Downeast Institute, says the overall mass of green crab went down as the Gulf cooled in 2014 to 2015, but there are still large numbers of them -- they're just smaller.
"If seawater temperatures increase quickly in the spring and summer like in 2012-2013, we could see another explosion in the larger ones later in the summer or early fall," he says.
Chad Coffin, of Freeport, president of the Maine Clammers Association, says that would be a disaster.
"Here in Casco Bay, the soft shell clam industry has totally collapsed and a return to water temperatures experienced in 2012 could spell doom for a rebound that clammers have pinned to juvenile clams," he says.
Experts say there's little that Maine can do by itself to address the underlying issue: the continued warming of the Earth because of greenhouse gas emissions from factories, cars, power plants, livestock feedlots and other human activities. Maine produces just 0.32 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or about 0.05 percent of those in the world.
Instead, they say, Mainers could mitigate the damage by shoring up the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, reducing other stresses we can control and learning ways to protect resources from some of the worst effects, including ocean acidification, a byproduct of the changing climate that hampers the survival of at least some juvenile shellfish species.

Full text:   Agricultural Trades Show provides networking opportunity
AUGUSTA -- Anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 people will make their way through the Maine Agricultural Trades Show this week, and it's possible that among them are prospective customers for Joel Davis and Central Maine Meats.
As a relatively new player in the market, the facility is working to raise its profile across Maine. Customer by customer, the company is increasing its reach into the agricultural community, and it's hiring to meet those needs.
"We're growing very nicely," Davis, managing director for Central Maine Meats, said Tuesday.
In late December, company officials received word from the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development that they had secured a $100,000 employee training grant through the Community Development Block Grant Program funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
That's in addition to the $540,000 block grant awarded in the middle of last year to allow the company to expand its production more quickly and to add equipment for producing specialized products like sausage and smoked meats. That grant came with a job-creation requirement that obligates the company to hire 14 people with just more than half of them coming from low- to moderate-income levels.
"We have a vision of expanding in a controlled environment," Davis said.
Within the next week or so, the company's flash freezer will come on line, and workers are being trained to use it. With it, Davis said, Central Maine Meats will have the ability to flash freeze seafood, shellfish and even vegetables for its customers.
The company has also acquired a smoker, and later this year, after it's installed and the training on using it is completed, that will be operational.
Mark Brown may never be one of Davis' customers. Even so, on Tuesday he stopped by the Central Maine booth while making the rounds at the trades show to inquire about the operation.
For four decades, Brown and his wife, Connie, operated Longmeadows Farm in Benton. The farm, on the National Register of Historic Places, is now in the hands of their son, Xandy, and his wife, Sherry, but Brown said he keeps his hand in by helping out during summers.
For years, they have used the same slaughterhouse, and they are satisfied with it. But he said he can see the opportunity for Central Maine Meats in the marketplace.
"You used to be able to get in whenever you wanted," Brown said. "Now, the slaughterhouses are booked up for years." It can take months to get on a schedule, he said.
Central Maine Meats is not quite at that point, Davis said, but the schedule is filling up.
For Davis, the business is about maximizing opportunities and finding markets for new products, like cowhides and possibly sheepskins, which are byproducts of the slaughtering facility in addition to providing quality cuts of meat.
"We have a customer who sells lamb to high-end restaurants in Boston and New York City," he said. "She's familiar with the needs of the chefs in terms of the cuts of meat they are looking for, and she has been in to show our cutters those cuts."
Because the facility is U.S. Department of Agriculture inspected, it's allowed to sell meat across state lines.
"To me, the most interesting piece is the local food strategy has been on the city's radar for a while," Patrick Wright, economic and community development coordinator for the city of Gardiner, said. "We're in proximity to farms and distribution networks and population centers, and doesn't it make sense to be a food hub? This is a realization of that goal, and we're excited to facilitate that expansion. We're hoping Central Maine Meats can represent a cluster of food related businesses, particularly helped by being in a cluster because there are similar needs for infrastructure and distribution."
The Maine Agricultural Trades Show continues through Thursday at the Augusta Civic Center.

Full text:   I've lived on North Haven Island in Penobscot Bay for more than 40 years now. In my recent conversations there with lobstermen and others who work on the water -- on North Haven and up and down the coast -- one thing has become abundantly clear: The ocean that they and so many others in Maine depend on for their living isn't the same as it was even 10 years ago.
I commend Press Herald staff writer Colin Woodard for his thorough coverage of the many ways climate change is negatively affecting the Gulf of Maine -- among them, the shifting habitat of vital species, the boom of invasive species and rising water temperatures that make it more difficult for pressured populations such as cod to rebound. All of these issues have come together in a perfect storm of sorts to threaten the marine biodiversity that Maine's coastal economy has been built on.
I'm working in Washington to raise alarm bells on these dire threats to the future of our coastal communities. I invite any of my colleagues who continue to ignore the realities of climate change to come to Maine to see it in action and talk to the men and women it's already affecting.
In particular, I've tried to bring federal attention to one effect of climate change that isn't as visible as others -- ocean acidification.
As more carbon dioxide has been released into the atmosphere, oceans have absorbed much of it, with Maine's cold waters making an especially good sponge. Along with increased runoff from extreme weather and precipitation, oceans have become 30 percent more acidic since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and models predict that pace to quicken sharply.
The changing makeup of the water has a devastating impact on a number of marine species, but especially shellfish. The acidic water makes it more difficult for mussels, oysters and clams, among others, to develop strong shells, leading to higher rates of mortality and decreased numbers.
Though these effects have been well documented, there is a severe lack of information about ocean acidification and a number of questions without clear answers. Two of the biggest I have are: How does ocean acidification affect lobster populations? What can our communities do to prepare and mitigate the effects?
It's no secret why the first question would be important here in Maine. As the populations of other kinds of fish have declined, our economy has become increasingly dependent on one species. Lobsters currently make up about 69 percent of our commercial fishing catch, so it's imperative that we investigate how ocean acidification may affect their health.
But we already know that ocean acidification negatively affects other shellfish species that make significant contributions to our economy. The question then becomes: How should we be helping our communities deal with these impacts now and in the future?
As we turn to face the more visible effects of climate change, we simply can't afford to be blindsided by ocean acidification. To that end, I've introduced federal legislation -- H.R. 2553, the Coastal Communities Acidification Act of 2015 -- to try to find answers to these and other questions.
The bill would require the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to identify which communities are most dependent on the ocean and study how acidification would affect them if valuable industries such as lobster harvesting were affected. I'm proud that 30 of my colleagues, including nine Republicans, have signed on in support of the bill.
I applaud the leadership of the Maine Legislature in creating a commission to study ocean acidification in Maine. A report that the group released earlier this year notes, "Perhaps the most alarming of the commission's findings is how much we do not know about ocean acidification and how it will affect Maine's commercially important species, including the iconic lobster."
I completely agree. While I hope the state will move forward in addressing this report's recommendations, I think the federal government also should do its part in closing the knowledge gap. This is a national problem, and one Maine shouldn't have to deal with alone.
Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, represents Maine's 1st District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Full text:   There is much disturbing news about climate change, but there is also good news. This tells both.
Bad news first. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, burning fossil fuels has increased the level of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, in our atmosphere. In effect, we have covered the Earth with an atmospheric blanket of greenhouse gases. Current concentrations of carbon dioxide are higher than at any time in the entire history of humans on Earth.
The oceans are absorbing about half of this increased carbon dioxide, making ocean water more acidic, which is beginning to seriously affect our shellfish industry, as detailed recently by Colin Woodard of the Portland Press Herald.
The really bad news is that there is a real and dangerous probability that one or more climate disruptions (scientists refer to them as tipping points) will come into play and accelerate climate warming if we take no action to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The major result would be a rapid rise in both sea levels and the associated costs of dealing with such a catastrophe.
A July 23 Department of Defense report to Congress begins, "Climate change ... is an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows and conflicts over basic resources such as food and water.
"These impacts are already occurring, and the scope, scale and intensity of these impacts are projected to increase over time."
It's not just climate scientists and climate activists who see the bad news. Many conservatives recognize that the risks to the climate and our national security require action but dislike the government regulatory actions that have been the only option so far since the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the risks fall under the Clean Air Act.
Now for the good news.
It's not too late to reverse the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases with a bold legislative solution that both political parties can embrace. The policy, called Carbon Fee and Dividend, creates many new jobs as it builds a new economy with alternative energy.
Carbon Fee and Dividend was developed by George Schultz, President Ronald Reagan's secretary of the Treasury and is being put before Congress by Citizens Climate Lobby. It is a market-based solution that corrects the failure of the market to properly assign the costs to society of burning fossil fuels. Costs such as:
[bullet] Extra flood disaster costs faced by FEMA.
[bullet] Health care costs of air pollution and increasing heat stress.
[bullet] Disruptions in agriculture caused by unpredictable weather.
[bullet] Changes in fisheries caused by ocean warming and acidification.
Under Carbon Fee and Dividend, companies that extract fossil fuels will pay a fee at the source (the coal mine, oil or gas well, or port of entry). This fee would start at $15 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions, and increase steadily each year so that clean energy will be cheaper than fossil fuels within a decade.
All of the money collected from the carbon fee will be returned to American households on an equal basis. About two-thirds of all households would break even or receive more in their dividend checks than they would pay in higher prices due to the fee. This would protect the poor and middle class.
On the side of industry, a predictably increasing carbon price will send a clear market signal to entrepreneurs, businesses and homeowners to invest in the new clean-energy economy. There is also a border adjustment to protect U.S. companies from imports originating in countries that don't have a similar economic plan to control carbon dioxide emissions.
A 2014 study by Regional Economic Models Inc. found that Carbon Fee and Dividend would save hundreds of thousands of lives over 20 years while cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half, building the economy and adding 2.8 million new jobs.
Carbon Fee and Dividend legislation will put us on the path to a sustainable climate by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning us to a clean energy economy.
I invite interested people to join efforts to persuade members of Congress by writing to their representatives and senators.

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it -- their favorite inns, restaurants, trips, activities, experiences, travel books and websites -- in their own personal style. They offer anecdotes, tips and the details you need. Join them in exploring the great state of Maine.
I certainly had been looking forward to a special meal at Aragosta in Stonington, but little did I realize that this would be the dining experience of my lifetime. This year, Aragosta chef Devin Finigan created a chef's tasting menu in lieu of a traditional menu. They book diners for specific times so that the restaurant can serve the many courses at similar times. Seven courses plus a couple of surprises requires an orchestrated plan.
A friend of mine had recently been to Stonington and was shocked to see how much food was on this menu. "I don't know how anyone could eat all that food," she remarked. But the chef prepares small, delicate portions created with extraordinary artistry and care. We dined with friends Rusty and Sue Atwood, and all agreed that it was the perfect amount of food. We photographed, oohed and aahed over each spectacular morsel over our two-hour dining experience. We were sated, not overstuffed.
From the outset -- a starter of perfect unique baby vegetables served with a mustard sauce -- we were taken with the presentation of our food. Their housemade breadsticks, served standing tall in a tin container, were to die for. Amazing on their own, they were even better with herbed butter. When the server brought more, we did not decline.
Next came Blue Hill heirloom tomatoes. Sunflower shoots, something new for me, along with garlic pesto and egg yolk, were shaved over the top. We all went crazy over the crispy shallots. This dish was light, delicate and full of seasonal flavors.
I thought I'd be skipping over the Blue Hill Bay mussels course, not being a big fan of seafood. But they were extraordinarily prepared with a summer soffrito combined with a lobster and white wine broth. It certainly tempted me to try these baby mussels and I'm so glad I did. They were sweet and tender. George is always saying that it's the broth that makes the mussels so good, and that, combined with their tenderness, won me over.
George couldn't believe it when I said I enjoyed the Maine haddock. I think he'd been counting on eating mine. It was topped with lemon breadcrumbs and arugula aioli and was the first time I've ever liked haddock. Sue and I discovered that we loved the Spagarelli -- it's an Italian green with a bitter taste that really worked well with the fish.
So I was two-for-two on seafood and, wouldn't you know, the lobster course won me over as well. The Lobster Raviolo (I learned that one of ravioli is called a raviolo), was much awaited by all the diners, as this is the chef's signature dish. Mesclun, citrus beurre blanc and micro-greens supported the perfectly cooked pasta. The lobster inside was simply prepared and the nice lemony flavor didn't overpower the star of this plate. I ate every bit and it was indeed amazing.
Next came a terrific Old Ackley Farm duck confit. Perfect potato gnocchi, toasted pecans, arugula and apples blended with the deep rich flavor of the duck. At this point, it was truly impossible to choose a favorite dish.
"Oh, that smells good!" Sue exclaimed as the Vermont quail arrived. It looked like miniature portions of fried chicken, but these were dusted with polenta and served over amber squash puree. A baby quail egg pickled in beet juice and a baby zucchini with it greens still attached almost stole the show on this one.
Sue and I were happy to see chocolate included in our dessert. A sliver of chocolate fudge cake accompanied a poached pear and ginger ice cream. Heaven.
What a memorable meal this was! If you are a diner who truly appreciates food, are ready to be dazzled by spectacularly presented dishes and want to experience intricate flavors, put Aragosta and its tasting menu on your docket for next summer.
Well, I guess you can tell that Linda loved this dinner. So did I, but she left me no room to tell you why. Well, here's what I can add: the interior of the restaurant is stunningly beautiful, with large windows overlooking the ocean. Most of their produce comes from Maine farms and fishermen. Every dish was creatively unique and delicious. And yes, I was wickedly disappointed that Linda ate every bit of her seafood dishes. That was truly unprecedented and amazing.
The staff, including our servers Jenny and Sadie, were personable and well-educated on all the dishes. We loved hearing Sadie describe the dishes in great detail. The experience was enhanced by the clearing of tableware after every course. We also recommend sharing this great experience with friends. Rusty and Sue made this a special and memorable evening for us.
I'd be hard-pressed to choose a favorite dish, honestly. I did especially love the mussels and lobster raviolo -- and the fact that every dish was a learning experience, at least for me. Priced at $75 per person, this experience is a real bargain. It's now on our short list of dining experiences we will want to enjoy every year.

Full text:   Legislators seek backing for bills to increase data needed to shore up ecosystem
Last of six parts
AUGUSTA -- When the Maine Legislature's commission on ocean acidification reported its findings -- that the state's fisheries and aquaculture industries were threatened by this baleful byproduct of global warming -- officials here were not exactly spurred to action.
Acidification, driven by increased carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and freshwater runoff from extreme rainfall in river basins, has been implicated in failures at oyster hatcheries and mussel farms and has been shown to weaken clams and other shell-building animals vital to Maine's fishing and aquaculture industries. But bills introduced by lawmakers in the last session -- one each by a Democratic marine scientist and a Republican lobsterman -- to implement many of the panel's findings were withdrawn, one for lack of resources, the other for lack of support from Gov. Paul LePage's administration.
"I could see the bill wasn't going to go anywhere and that the governor was going to veto it," Rep. Mick Devin, a Democrat from Newcastle, says of legislation he sponsored to allow the commission to continue its work for another three years.
Patricia Aho, who was the commissioner of environmental protection until she resigned in August, opposed Devin's bill, saying the status quo was sufficient. "Since the issues of climate change and ocean acidification are inextricably linked, we think it will be more efficient to consider this issue in the broader context of climate change and adaptation programs," she said in written testimony to legislators.
Devin's bill and another one sponsored by Rep. Wayne Parry, a Republican from Arundel, were carried over to the next legislative session. Parry's bill would have put a bond issue on the ballot that would borrow $3 million to fund several of the expert committee's recommendations: collecting data, monitoring waterways and performing tests in coastal waters to better assess the effect of acidification on wildlife and commercial fish species. It was withdrawn after failing to make it to the top of an informal list of bonding priorities drawn up by legislative leaders.

The Gulf of Maine has been warming at a rate faster than nearly anywhere else on the planet, and water temperature in 2012 was the highest in the century and a half that readings have been collected. The effects, including the retreat of native species, the spread of invaders from more southern climes and the acidification of seawater, have been substantial and are expected to be more so in the future as long-term warming trends make the 2012-like temperature the "new normal" by mid-century.
Experts say there's little that Maine or New England can do by itself to address the underlying issue: the continued warming of the Earth because of greenhouse gas emissions from factories, cars, power plants, livestock feedlots and other human activities. Maine produces just 0.32 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which works out to about 0.05 percent of those in the world.
But Mainers could mitigate the damage by shoring up the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, reducing other stresses we can control and learning ways to protect resources from some of the worst effects.
"We have to pay attention to the factors we can exert some control over and try to identify ones that would produce the best possible return, the best bang for your buck," says Katherine Mills, a fisheries ecologist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland who has studied the effect of warming sea temperature on salmon and other species.
"If we limit pollution, if we reduce excess nutrients in our rivers, if we ensure the coastal habitats to be as robust as they can be, that's going to help the system to be resilient," says Matt Abbott, the Fundy Baykeeper at the Conservation Council of New Brunswick, an environmental group. "Even if we don't know exactly what is going to happen, we know changes are occurring and that the system needs to be as robust as it can."
At a local level, scientists believe, there are ways to mitigate the effects of one aspect of a warming gulf: ocean acidification.
Eelgrasses and kelps take up dissolved carbon dioxide at a remarkable rate -- with almost triple the effectiveness of a similar acreage of forest -- and consume excess nutrients, the two primary drivers of acidification. In doing so, they reduce the acidity of the surrounding seawater to the benefit of clams, mussels and other creatures living nearby.
The Rockland-based Island Institute, a nonprofit that supports coastal communities, is partnering with a commercial kelp farm off Chebeague Island and scientists at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay to find out how effective and widespread these benefits can be. This winter -- the growing season for kelp -- they'll deploy monitoring equipment around one of Ocean Approved Inc.'s first-in-the-nation open-ocean commercial kelp farms. (Disclosure: this reporter is a Bigelow trustee.)
"You may very well be able to improve the growing conditions for shellfish on a very local level by locating a kelp farm with shellfish," says Suzie Arnold, the marine scientist at the Island Institute who is collaborating on the effort. Kelp, she says, could become "the new kale," a nutritious food source, while improving the environment, the survival of shellfish and the winter employment opportunities in fishing communities.
Eighty-seven percent of the value of Maine's $585 million commercial fish catch comes from shell-building creatures, including lobsters, clams, scallops and oysters. The federal government estimates the industry supports 33,000 jobs in Maine, roughly half of them ashore.
Those on the front lines of acidification are frustrated that the state government isn't doing more.
"Maine's resource industries are what defines the state, and it totals up to a lot of money," says Bill Mook. The founder of Mook Sea Farms, he watched acidic water devastate crops of newly hatched oysters. "It boggles my mind that as a state we wouldn't act on bills that would give us some idea of what businesspeople like me will be facing."
The ocean acidification commission, a panel of scientists, fishermen, aquaculturists and legislators, studied the problem and issued a range of recommendations, many of them focused on the collection of data that will help assess more precisely what the effects are and will be on key species. The "most alarming" finding, their 122-page report stated, was "how much we do not know about ocean acidification and how it will affect Maine's commercially important species."
"We're far more dependent than at any other time on lobsters, for instance, but we don't know what the pH is in the important coastal regions where the juvenile stages of development and settlement of lobsters occur and how it affects their survival," says Sen. Chris Johnson, D-Somerville, who co-chaired the commission with Devin. "We can't wait until we have a collapse of an economically important species for our industry. We need to be working now on how to test mitigation strategies and build our monitoring."
Parry, the lobsterman legislator who sponsored the acidification monitoring bond, agrees. "The biggest thing we learned on the commission was that we don't have enough data," he says. "I'm normally not a bond person, but we need to be able to get the equipment so that we can have continuous, real-time monitoring so we can determine what is what. It's very important for the survival of all Maine fisheries."
The DEP, asked to substantiate why it believes existing programs are sufficient to deal with the problem, sent the Press Herald a five-page summary of its programs that touch on climate change, including providing technical assistance for eelgrass restoration in Casco Bay, the routine collection of discharge data from polluters, participation in the acidification commission's meetings and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multi-state effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Asked to comment on the DEP summary, Johnson says, "It's suggesting that what we're doing already is good enough. That is not the case."
The administration, he said, left a number of key goals unaddressed, including identifying and reducing acidification-causing nutrient pollution from unpermitted sources, stepping up ocean chemistry monitoring, or creating a body that can coordinate the necessary work.
"None of the departments have stepped up to embrace the need for an entity that will move things forward so we don't just wait for something to happen," he says.
Devin, a marine laboratory manager and a Democratic legislator from Newcastle, says such an entity is vital. "Without a formal committee, none of this is going to be a priority," he says. "Our state government needs to take the lead on this, because we're not going to have a federal response on this at this time."
The state of Washington has taken the lead in confronting ocean acidification, which threatens its $270 million shellfish industry. Its blue-ribbon panel released findings in November 2012 that helped inform the Maine commission's study. The day it released the report, Gov. Chris Gregoire ordered state agencies to take steps to implement it and called for increased investments in scientific research and efforts to curb nutrient-laden runoff.
California convened its own ocean acidification panel in 2012, which has since been joined by the governments of Oregon, Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia and is now a vehicle to study the problem and build political momentum to address the issue up and down the West Coast.
Maine DEP spokesman David Madore said the administration also has made steps to address other aspects of climate change, highlighting the work of the Environmental and Energy Resources Working Group, an interagency panel convened by LePage and chaired by Aho. That group issued a report in September 2014 recommending its work should be continued to coordinate action and the implementation of 31 other specific recommendations, four of which appear to bear directly on climate change effects on the gulf.
More than a year later, however, the group has not reconvened. Madore said Aho "had a timetable to restart and expand the working group" beginning this fall or winter, but that those plans had been put on hold after her departure last month. Acting commissioner Avery Day is "aware of the importance of this work going forward," but "has not formalized any schedule for implementation."
Two of the four actions directly related to the gulf -- the development of a $26.9 million bond issue to repair, replace and upgrade failed septic systems and commercial discharge practices, and the creation of new water runoff models for the state -- will be acted on once the group reconvenes, Madore said. A third -- increasing stormwater assumptions in culvert replacement rules -- was implemented this August, he said, backed by $800,000 in grants to help pay for new projects.
The other directly relevant recommendation -- to assist fishermen in adapting to climate-induced changes in fish stocks -- falls under the Department of Marine Resources' jurisdiction. In a written response for information on how this was being implemented, a department spokesman cited the department's efforts to develop regulations for the fishing of black sea bass, its support for confronting the green crab explosion (including the fencing of clam flats and the convening of a summit on the issue), and the ongoing development of a long-term lobster fishery management plan.
The spokesman also said the department "remains committed to participating in ongoing discussions and supporting efforts by organizations that are targeting" ocean acidification.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat representing Maine's 1st District, has introduced federal legislation directing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the likely effects of acidification on individual coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge. Her staff said the bill's short-term prospects were dim because the Republican leadership of the U.S. House had little enthusiasm for funding climate-related research.
"I'm really quite concerned about ocean acidification and its impact on the Gulf of Maine," Pingree said in a statement. "We need more information, more research and we need to be much better prepared."
Parry, the Republican state representative from Arundel, put it this way in his testimony: "We can say it's mostly from airborne CO2, but we here in Maine are not going to stop China and India from polluting."
"If there are things we can do here in Maine," he told legislators, "we should try."

Full text:   Researchers find that decrease in ocean pH stunts shellbuilders' development
Fifth of six parts
WALPOLE -- The baby mussels are thriving.
Two months ago they were near-invisible larvae, swimming around tanks of seawater in a refrigerated room at the Darling Marine Center. Now tens of thousands of the tiny mollusks, each just a few millimeters long, have attached themselves to the different kinds of rope scientists have been testing here, and are eating the lab's stock of algal food at an impressive clip.
Mick Devin, the lab manager at this University of Maine research facility, has been overseeing this experiment, part of an effort to master the art of hatching mussels, something mussel farmers -- who grow their product on lines hanging in seawater -- previously never have needed to do.
"Mussel farmers have been able to just throw their lines out and collect all the larvae they want from nature," Devin says. "But mussel populations are down drastically in this state, so that may not be working so well now." Hatcheries, he expects, may have to step up in the not-too-distant future.
Mussels have been vanishing from stretches of coastline where they once were ubiquitous, and scientists remain uncertain why. Green crabs, whose population exploded after an "ocean heat wave" in 2012, may have stripped many sections clean. But warmer water and increased rainfall -- both problems expected to grow in Maine as a result of global climate change -- may be creating a far worse problem: an acid sea.
"We know this affects larval development in bivalves, (and) chances are it will result in decreased numbers, whether it's a natural population on a bed or one in a farm," says Paul Rawson, of the University of Maine's School of Marine Sciences, who is in charge of the research. "We need to make sure the technology is in place so the farms will have a reliable source of seed."
'GROUND ZERO'
The world's oceans are turning more acidic. Since the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have grown by more than 70 percent and now stand at the highest level in at least 800,000 years. As the oceans absorb additional CO2, they've become 30 percent more acidic over this period. By 2050, scientists estimate, surface pH levels will be lower -- that is, more acidic -- than at any time in several million years and by 2100 more acidic than any time in the past 300 million years -- two or three times more so than today.
The Gulf of Maine is particularly vulnerable because its colder water more readily absorbs carbon dioxide and because the increasing frequency of major snow and rain events flood the gulf with more acidic river runoff. Monitoring buoys have recorded an increase in CO2 levels of about 1.25 parts per million -- or roughly 0.3 percent -- per year in the gulf since they were installed in 2007.
With climate models predicting a 9 percent to 14 percent increase in winter precipitation -- and more modest increases in spring and fall -- across Maine, New Hampshire and most of eastern Massachusetts in the middle decades of this century, the situation is expected to continue worsening faster than the global average, with serious effects on marine life and coastal communities.
"Maine is ground zero for North Atlantic acidification," says Mark Green, professor of marine science at St. Joseph's College in Standish. "It's happening, it's documented, but we don't know when the tipping point is going to be reached."
Maine's fisheries economy is also especially vulnerable, as it depends on species that may not thrive in a more acidic gulf. "Shellbuilders are the ones that will be impacted the most, and we have an overwhelming reliance on shellbuilding organisms," notes Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at the Island Institute in Rockland who studies the problem. Eighty-seven percent of the value of Maine's commercial fish catch comes from creatures that have shells, including lobsters, clams, scallops and oysters.
The effects of acidification on lobsters have barely been studied in colder water. The only published research -- a 2012 study from St. Francis Xavier University conducted on Nova Scotia's northern coast -- suggested that larvae exposed to acidic conditions were smaller and slower to develop, though scientists say more research is needed to really get a handle on the effect.
Most immediately affected are bivalves such as mussels, oysters and clams, which have a much harder time building their shells in more acidic conditions.
Bill Mook, owner of Mook Sea Farm just up the river from the Darling Center, started seeing mass die-offs of oyster larvae at his hatchery a decade ago, usually following a major storm, an increasingly frequent occurrence in Maine. "We'd see the swimming larvae develop normally for a week or two, and then they'd just stop feeding," he recalls. "At first we couldn't figure out what was happening."
Then in 2009 a visiting Oregon oyster farm owner described an ongoing disaster in that state's hatcheries, where production had fallen by 80 percent. The larvae, he told colleagues in Maine, turned out to be dying because the water was too acidic, making it much harder for them to build their first shells out of dissolved calcium carbonate in the surrounding seawater. The energy reserves from their eggs was running out before the larvae could develop their digestive organs and survive on their own.
Mook began testing the pH of the water entering the hatchery from the Damariscotta. After each storm it was way too high, and the level in between storms was going up as well. "When I started my business 30 years ago, the CO2 levels were at least 30 parts per million lower, so even during spring rains the carbonate conditions would remain OK," he says.
Now, with the background level higher, each major storm drove acidity conditions into the red. In a few decades, even the background level may be too high for spring larvae to survive.
Mook now treats the water coming into his hatchery to ensure proper pH levels are maintained, but he fears what it means for wild shellfish populations. "The real question here is what is happening to the mussel larvae," he says. "I predict the impact of ocean acidification is going to be first felt by the wild bivalve fisheries like clams and mussels and will be manifested by a failure of recruitment" -- the failure of the infants to survive and become adults.
The state's aquaculture industry is extremely concerned about acidification. "Make no mistake about it: What is at risk here is nothing short of the future of the aquaculture and fishing sectors of this state," Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, warned state legislators in June.
Belle knows of at least one instance when mussel farmers witnessed a different sort of failure. The larvae built their shells and grew into tiny mussels but couldn't attach themselves to ropes for some reason. This is particularly worrisome, because scientists at the University of Washington have found that acidification substantially reduces the strength of the threadlike material -- the byssus -- that mussels use to anchor themselves.
"We don't know enough about the physiological impacts of shifts of ocean pH on specific organisms," Belle says. "There's been a lot of talk about shellfish, but we've heard relatively little about the impact on larval finfish. What about cod and halibut larvae?" -- two species farmed in Maine. "Is there an impact on their ability to metamorphose and grow into juveniles?"
Researchers at Stony Brook University in New York also have established that high carbon dioxide levels in seawater kill many hard-shell clam larvae and weaken the shells of the juveniles that do survive, stunting their future growth even when CO2 levels returned to normal.
Jeff Clements, a doctoral student at the University of New Brunswick in Saint John, has been studying how juvenile soft-shell clams deal with another problem: muddy bottoms that have become more acidic. "If they are exposed to acidic sediments, they won't burrow into them," he says. "The juveniles let the tidal currents carry them around as they search for places where that's not a problem. Problem is, they're exposed to predators the whole time they do that."
With all of these challenges, Green, the St. Joseph's College professor, believes humans are going to have to learn to grow shellfish larvae into juveniles to maintain wild stocks. "Hatcheries are going to become so important, because wild populations are going to falter," he says. "Larval clams and mussels can't survive with the water chemistry changes that are going to come. There's no two ways about it."

Full text:   Fourth of six parts
BRUNSWICK -- Until two years ago, if you had walked down to the shore of Maquoit Bay at low tide, you would have seen a meadow of eelgrass stretching nearly as far as the eye could see across the exposed seafloor. Here near the head of the bay, the sea grass stretched for 2 miles to the opposite shore, creating a vast nursery for the shellfish and forage species of Casco Bay, of which Maquoit is a part.
Now there's only mud.
Green crabs took over the bay in the late fall of 2012 and the spring and summer of 2013, tearing up the eelgrass in their pursuit of prey and devouring almost every clam and mussel from here to Yarmouth. Fueled by record high water temperature in 2012 and a mild winter in 2013, the green crab population grew so huge that the mudflats of Casco Bay became cratered with their burrowing, and much of the Maquoit and adjacent Middle Bay bottom turned into a lunar landscape.
Eelgrass coverage in Maquoit Bay fell by 83 percent. With nothing rooted to the bottom, the seawater turned far muddier, making life hard on any plants or baby clams that tried to recolonize the bay.
"We were astounded," says Hilary Neckles, of the U.S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, who linked the destruction to the green crabs. "The ecological ramifications really reverberate throughout the ecosystem, because sea grass is the preferred habitat of so many fish and shellfish species."
Over the past decade, the Gulf of Maine has been one of the fastest-warming parts of the world's oceans, allowing warm-water intruders to gain a toehold and earlier invaders such as the green crab to take over. Coupled with declines of the cold-loving species that have dominated the gulf for thousands of years, the ecological effects of even more gradual long-term warming are expected to be serious, even as precise forecasting remains beyond the scope of current science.
Scientists say the 2012 "ocean heat wave" was an unusual event, and that the 10-year accelerated warming trend is likely part of an oceanographic cycle and unlikely to continue. But the gulf has been warming consistently for more than 30 years, and long-term forecasts project average sea surface temperature in our region could reach 2012-like levels by midcentury. The events of 2012 and the nearly as warm year that followed probably provide a preview of things to come, of a gulf radically transformed, with major implications for life on the Maine coast.
Genevieve MacDonald, who fishes for lobster out of Stonington, was standing on the dock at Isle au Haut one morning that summer, looked in the water and couldn't believe her eyes. There, swimming around the harbor like mackerel, were dozens and dozens of longfin squid, temperate creatures rarely seen in the chilly water of eastern Maine. "If you had a cast net, you could have brought in a whole basket full of squid," she recalls.
Since then, people from Brunswick to Bristol have been encountering gigantic beds of gelatinous, finger-shaped pods in shallow water at low tide, some measuring 4 feet across. Researchers from the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center ran across one in August 2014 in the Damariscotta River and, perplexed as to what they were, brought them back to the lab. A colleague recognized it at once: a longfin squid egg mass containing thousands of squirming embryos.
The squid, apparently, are intending to stick around, and MacDonald hopes they do, since they're the stuff of calamari. "Climate change is real, but it might also provide some new opportunities if we're careful," she says. "Lobstering is really lucrative, and I hope it stays that way; but if something happens, it would be nice to have a backup plan."
Marissa McMahan spent that notoriously warm summer of 2012 lobstering with her father out of Georgetown and encountered a different visitor, a large, stout gray-and-black fish she'd never seen before. The fish, which began turning up in lobster traps up and down the coast, was the black sea bass, a succulent mid-Atlantic species normally unable to tolerate Maine's cold sea.
Now a doctoral student at Northeastern University, McMahan is doing her dissertation on how black sea bass are spreading and interacting with lobster and other native species. "I don't see anything to immediately worry about, but I talk to a lot of fishermen south of Cape Cod who think sea bass have played a role in reducing lobster numbers there," she says. "They tend to open up the sea bass they catch, and they do have a lot of lobsters inside them."
"It's a very sought-after and marketable fish, so it could create an economic subsidy where we're pretty much dependent on one single fishery," McMahan adds. "But if there are all these other species moving north, we may have a lot more predators on lobsters."
Other invaders appear to have few upsides.
Larry Harris, of the University of New Hampshire, has been tracking the spread of an unpleasant Asian weed, the pancake batter tunicate, an ugly, bloblike sea squirt that grows in dense colonies that spread in sheets across the seafloor, smothering native creatures. "It can overgrow mussels and sponges and anemones and other species that provide food for predators," he says, noting that nothing here wants to eat it. "It's the tunicate from hell."
Brought to New England by shellfish farmers using Asian oysters, the tunicate used to die back each winter, but with the warmer water temperatures, it has expanded over large swaths of the bottom from Passamaquoddy Bay to Georges Bank, where Harris thinks its presence might be contributing to the failure of cod stocks.
Green crabs, a European species introduced to the East Coast in the mid-19th century, reached Maine in the late 1940s, when the gulf began experiencing a warming spike second only to the present one. Then, as now, the crabs' assault on soft-shell clams made newspaper headlines. "Green Killers March On," the Portland Evening Express warned in January 1952, reporting that "old-timers suggest extreme cold and heavy sheet ice ... were responsible for keeping them under control."
The gulf has seen cold and warm cycles since then, but with an ever warmer background trend, the green crabs appear to be doing more lasting damage.
With its 20-foot tides and miles of sheltered bottom, Cobscook Bay, a multi-chambered estuary in easternmost Maine, is to intertidal ecologists what the Amazon is to rainforest researchers, a place where whelks and periwinkles grow to Jurassic proportions. Animals that normally live below the low-tide mark -- accessible only by scuba or submarine -- live in the intertidal zone there and can be studied with no more than a pair of boots.
Carl Merrill, director of Suffolk University's field station in Edmunds, on the western end of the bay, has been studying Cobscook's shores for nearly 40 years. In his surveys, he used to find both the smooth and rough periwinkles in concentrations of hundreds to thousands of individuals per square meter. Now he gets dozens or fewer per square meter. "The decline is substantial and very obvious," he says. "Sometimes you don't find one."
The culprit isn't harvesters -- "wrinklers" collect the larger, non-native common periwinkle, which lives lower down the intertidal zone. "The green crab is the likely explanation," Merrill says. The crustaceans appear to be picking the shore clean of the little snails, with unknown ecological effects.
The crabs also appear to be stripping much of the coast of mussels. On shorelines that 20 or 30 years ago were carpeted with the bivalves -- taking up half the available space -- they now cover less than 10 percent. Water temperature and ocean acidification may be playing a role, but green crabs appear to be a large part of the picture, since wild larvae settle and grow just fine at mussel farms and on the undersides of buoys and other objects the crabs can't reach.
Brian Beal, a marine shellfish ecologist at the University of Maine at Machias, says it's likely not just green crabs, but also lobsters and even Asian shore crabs, another invasive species that's already become the dominant shore crab in seacoast New Hampshire. Together, he suspects, they're eating the juvenile mussels, which explains why the bivalve is found only in places crabs can't get to easily.
Warming also is responsible for the collapse of soft-shell clam populations in Freeport, Brunswick, Penobscot and other communities, Beal says. "As water temperature increases, we get a higher predation rate because most of the predators are invertebrates who are much more active in warm water," including milky ribbon worms, moon snails and, of course, the green crab, he adds.
To prove his point, in April 2014 Beal oversaw the placement of net-covered plots in Freeport's Harraseeket River, which were then seeded with juvenile clams. Seven months later, 90 percent of the seeded clams in all plots had survived, plus a staggering 1,400 wild clams per square foot were taking refuge under the nets, designed to stop green crabs from entering. "We estimated that close to 13 million wild clams settled into those 40 netted plots during that seven-month experiment," Beal said. Just a few feet away from the 40 nets, his team found just 0.4 clams per square foot, suggesting predators account for the difference.
"We know that when we have cold water, we have more shellfish survival," says Freeport clammer Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association. "The real question is what we are going to do when it gets really warm again."
It's possible the warmer water will bring a solution with it.
At Nova Scotia's Kejimkujik National Park, rangers five years ago decided to take action against marauding green crabs, which already had torn up 88 percent of the eelgrass in the park's two estuaries, which face the open Atlantic near the entrance to the gulf. Their strategy: fish them hard with modified shrimp traps, composting the catch until a market develops. "It looks like we've had phenomenal success," Parks Canada ecologist Chris McCarthy says.
By 2013, trapping had helped knock the crab population down to size, with the average haul per trap falling from nearly 50 to fewer than eight. And as they cleaned out the green crabs, eelgrass returned, along with eels, geese, migrating shorebirds, proper water quality and the stability of the surrounding marsh. The park staff wondered whether the gains would be maintained if they started scaling back trapping.
Then a new invader started showing up in the traps: Callinectes sapidus, the Atlantic blue crab, a delicious cousin of the green crabs that is as iconic to the culture of the Chesapeake as lobsters are to Maine. Normally not seen north of Cape Cod, they began showing up in 2013 at Kejimkujik, where they were caught by the hundreds last year. "We've seen them chasing the green crabs around, so hopefully they'll have an effect on them without harming the sea grass," McCarthy says. "The big question will be if they can really establish themselves, given that we get fairly cold waters up here."
Harris, of UNH, says they're likely to do so, as southwestern Nova Scotia has fairly warm water. In fact, he says, there's now a small resident population in the Great Bay and Piscataqua River on the Maine-New Hampshire border. And despite two cold winters, he's seen the whole crab assemblage continuing to shift eastward, with Bar Harbor lobstermen catching blue crabs last year, Asian shore crabs taking over seacoast New Hampshire, Jonah crabs -- which once ranged no farther than Casco Bay -- established in Eastport, and large numbers of green crabs surviving cold Cobscook Bay winters, an indication that the species may be adapting to colder water.
The net ecological effect is anyone's guess. Adult Asian shore crabs will eat green crabs and aren't attracted to muddy areas, but they do enjoy stripping the shore of barnacles. Adult blue crabs will happily munch on green ones, but nobody knows what they'll do to, say, eelgrass. "Blue crabs are something fishermen can sell, so that's a good thing; but on the other hand, it's also an indication that the species composition of the intertidal zone is shifting," Harris says. "In terms of the overall effect, it's really too early to tell."

Full text:   On Nov. 3, Mainers will vote on three statewide referendum questions. One of these questions will have a direct impact on our roads, bridges and other modes of transportation that the working people and businesses of our state rely on every day.
Question 3 asks whether voters favor an $85 million bond issue for construction and maintenance of highways and roads, bridges and multimodal facilities such as ports, harbors, freight and passenger rail, aviation, transit and bicycle and pedestrian trails. A yes vote approves the bond issue.
As House chair of the Legislature's Transportation Committee, I worked closely with my colleagues on this bond issue, as well as a range of other transportation funding measures. States across the country are facing challenges when it comes to maintaining our infrastructure, not just Maine.
But we do have some unique challenges. Maine has a relatively small population spread over a large state. In fact, we have roughly twice as many miles of roads and bridges to take care of as New Hampshire, which has a population similar to ours.
Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of issuing the $85 million in bonds for these transportation needs before sending the proposal to Maine voters for final approval, as required by the Maine Constitution.
The bonds gained strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate because of the funding's importance to our state's future. Maine people deserve safer roads and a stronger economy, both of which will take adequate investment in our transportation system.
If approved, $68 million of these funds will be used to construct and repair state highways, repair secondary roads in partnership with local communities and replace or rehabilitate bridges. The remaining $17 million would be dedicated to a variety of other projects with the priority of identifying and targeting those that most improve public safety and support economic growth.
The $85 million investment will be used to leverage an additional estimated $121.5 million in federal and other funds. That means more than $200 million overall of improvements to our roads, bridges and other crucial projects.
If you drive on our state's roads, you don't need me to tell you the condition our infrastructure is in. Years of chronic underfunding have left our transportation system in rough shape. In the Portland area, 61 percent of major urban roads are in poor or mediocre condition.
According to the Maine Department of Transportation's three-year work plan, current funding falls short of the investment needed to keep up with basic maintenance of our existing road and bridge network by roughly $119 million annually.
It's a problem that affects Mainers every day. According to the state section of the American Society of Engineers, Maine motorists spend an extra $300 each year to maintain their vehicles because of the condition of our roads. Added vehicle maintenance costs are a burden on commuters and businesses alike.
Beyond these unnecessary costs, the aging and inadequate condition of our infrastructure has consequences for our economy. Think of our vibrant agricultural sector and farmers' need to get their products -- whether a truckload of potatoes, coolers of lamb chops from a small family farm or bushels of blueberries -- to market efficiently.
Our world-famous lobsters, clams, oysters and other seafood need to reach their final destination in the freshest condition possible. Eighteen-wheelers loaded with logs have to travel for miles to deliver their cargo. The reliability of Maine's roads matters to workers, about three-fourths of whom commute alone. Our state's large size and rural nature mean Mainers often travel long distances to their workplaces.
Tourists rely on our roads and highways when they come to Maine, whether they're leaf-peeping, going to the beach or heading into the mountains to ski or hike. The Maine Tourism Association has pointed out the importance of our transportation system to its industry, one of our largest economic sectors.
It says the condition of our roads plays a role in attracting the visitors who stay at our hotels, dine in our restaurants and patronize our shops and a wide range of other businesses. To keep them coming, we need to take care of our transportation infrastructure.
To learn more about Question 3 and the other referendum questions, visit the Maine Secretary of State's website. And vote on Nov. 3.
Rep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, is serving his second term in the Maine Legislature. He is chairman of the Transportation Committee.

Abstract: The Gulf of Maine -- which extends from Cape Cod in Massachusetts to Cape Sable at the southern tip of Nova Scotia and includes the Bay of Fundy, the offshore fishing banks, and the entire coast of Maine -- has been warming rapidly as the deep-water currents that feed it have shifted. Since 2004 the gulf has warmed faster than anyplace else on the planet, except for an area northeast of Japan, and during the "Northwest Atlantic Ocean heat wave" of 2012 average water temperatures hit the highest level in the 150 years that humans have been recording them.

First of six parts
YARMOUTH BAR, Nova Scotia -- Sandwiched on a narrow sandbar between Yarmouth's harbor and the open Gulf of Maine, the fishermen of Yarmouth Bar have long struggled to keep the sea at bay.
In the 19th century, storms threatened to sweep the whole place away, leaving Yarmouth proper's harbor more open to the elements, prompting the province to build a granite cribwork across the quarter-mile bar, behind which the hamlet's fishing fleet docks. Global warming has brought rising seas, a two-story-high rock wall to fight them and the hamlet's designation as one of the communities in the province most threatened by climate change.
Now, snaking around the snout of Nova Scotia and into the Gulf of Maine is a new, unseen threat to Yarmouth Bar and hundreds of coastal communities in Maine, eastern New England and the Maritimes: currents fueling the rapid warming of the sea.
The Gulf of Maine -- which extends from Cape Cod in Massachusetts to Cape Sable at the southern tip of Nova Scotia and includes the Bay of Fundy, the offshore fishing banks, and the entire coast of Maine -- has been warming rapidly as the deep-water currents that feed it have shifted. Since 2004 the gulf has warmed faster than anyplace else on the planet, except for an area northeast of Japan, and during the "Northwest Atlantic Ocean heat wave" of 2012 average water temperatures hit the highest level in the 150 years that humans have been recording them.
As a result, many native species -- boreal and subarctic creatures at the southern edges of their ranges -- are in retreat. Lobster populations have been shifting northward and out to sea along our coast as they've abandoned Long Island Sound almost entirely. Many of other commercially important bottom-dwelling fish -- including cod, pollock and winter flounder -- have been withdrawing from Maine and into the southwestern part of the gulf, where the bottom water is cooler.
"We're really in the cross hairs of climate change right now," says Andy Pershing, chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, who first revealed the alarming pace of the gulf's recent warming.
For two years running, Maine's northern shrimp fishery has been closed for lack of shrimp. Endangered right whales virtually have stopped visiting the waters off Lubec and Grand Manan because the tiny cold-loving copepods that they feed on -- as do herring and, indirectly, almost everything else in the gulf -- are in short supply there.
Warm-water invaders are gaining a toehold, and those that already had one are taking over. Green crab populations exploded in 2012 and 2013, extirpating soft-shell clams from vast areas of mudflats and stripping the northern parts of Casco Bay of their life-sustaining eelgrass meadows, which have yet to recover. Blue crabs, a species normally identified with the sultry Chesapeake, have been found in lobster traps and have started making themselves at home in southwestern Nova Scotia. Asian shore crabs now dominate the shores of seacoast New Hampshire. Ugly, bottom-smothering sea squirts have spread across the seafloor all the way to Eastport, displacing the animals that the gulf's sea creatures actually want to eat.
"The main message is that fish are definitely on the move," says Michael Fogarty, chief of the ecosystem assessment program at the National Marine Fisheries Service's Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. "There's no doubt about that, and it has ramifications for fishermen and the ecosystem."
In accordance with climate change models, the region also has been experiencing markedly increased rainfall and snowfall, reducing the salinity of the gulf and hampering the growth of the microscopic marine plants at the base of the food web. More frequent extreme precipitation events are making coastal waters more acidic, snuffing out baby oysters, mussels and other creatures that have difficulty building their shells under the new conditions.
"The impact of ocean acidification will be felt first by some of the wild bivalve fisheries like soft-shell clams and mussels," predicts oyster hatchery owner Bill Mook, who now often has to treat his water to make it alkaline enough for his stock. "It will be manifested by a failure of the larvae to become juveniles."
Two cold winters have given the gulf some breathing space, but climate models and recorded trends indicate our seas are going to keep warming, with the conditions experienced in the "ocean heat wave" becoming the new normal by midcentury. The result will be dramatic changes in an ecosystem Mainers have relied on since the end of the last ice age, ones for which our communities, industries and government are poorly prepared to face.
"We're conducting this great experiment, but we don't have a pristine control site to compare results to," says Larry Harris, a marine zoologist at the University of New Hampshire who studies invasive species. "Unfortunately we only have one Gulf of Maine."
Few places in the world's oceans are as well-suited to sustaining marine life as the Gulf of Maine. By a fortunate confluence of geography, geology, climate and oceanography, the gulf is a fertile oasis in an ocean that is, ecologically speaking, largely desert.
On a standard map, the gulf looks like little more than a bulge of the Atlantic Ocean; but on a nautical chart its true nature is revealed. Hidden just a few dozen feet beneath the waves at its southern entrance are two enormous submerged islands -- Georges and Browns banks -- which separate it from the surrounding ocean, deflecting and shaping ocean currents. It's really a semi-enclosed sea, like the Baltic or Mediterranean seas, with characteristics all its own.
Two narrow channels provide the only deep-water connections into the gulf. The larger of these, the Northeast Channel, is only 22 miles wide, but through it often flows a cold, nutrient-rich current originating among the ice floes of northern Labrador. It courses around the end of Nova Scotia and loops the mouth of the Bay of Fundy before flowing down the coast of Maine like an ecological conveyor belt, then arcing back around the northern flank of Georges Bank to form a spinning, life-sustaining gyre.
In the oceans, as on land, plants are at the base of the food web, capturing and storing the sun's energy through photosynthesis. At sea, most plants are microscopic, and they generally thrive when two things can be found at once: light, which is available only near the surface; and nutrients, which tend to fall to the dark ocean floor. The Gulf of Maine puts these things together in myriad ways.
First there are the river systems -- the Kennebec, Penobscot, St. Croix, St. John and 21 others -- that together drain a quarter-trillion gallons of fresh, nutrient-laden water into the gulf each year, further fertilizing the sea. The cold climate plays a role, helping to prevent nutrient-rich bottom water from being trapped under a thick layer of warmer, lighter surface water, as happens in warmer climates.
Then there are the tides -- the world's highest, thanks to the fortuitous interaction of coastal geography and the orbital tracks of the Earth and moon around the sun -- rising and falling 50 feet and more at the head of the gulf, the Minas Basin in Nova Scotia, and then surging in and out of the Bay of Fundy, where it collides with the north-south tides flowing in and out of the bays and estuaries of Maine. The tides mix and churn the water, keeping nutrients suspended in the lighted surface waters and even forming the Western Hemisphere's largest whirlpool, the Old Sow off Eastport at the Maine-New Brunswick border. They also create vast expanses of critical habitat: the salt marshes, clam flats, mussel banks and seagrass meadows that serve as nurseries for countless marine creatures.
The tides and currents flow across a ragged coast, especially between Cape Elizabeth and Saint John, New Brunswick, where deep bays and estuaries reach 5, 10 or 20 miles inland between long peninsulas, and thousands of islands dot the coast. The gulf is only 400 miles across from the elbow of Cape Cod to the Minas Basin, but if the coast were stretched into a straight line it would run for 7,500 miles -- 3,000 more if the island shores were added. All that coastline makes for an incredible abundance of prime ocean habitat, with large quantities of rocky, complex seafloor located near enough to the surface to be bathed in life-sustaining light.
In its pristine state, the Gulf of Maine was stupendously productive. Early European explorers were flabbergasted by its largesse. They encountered great schools of whales, landed 5-foot-long cod with virtually every drop of a hand-held hook, and waded at low tide to capture 20-pound lobsters among the rocks.
It was in the pursuit of cod that Maine was first colonized, starting with year-round fishing stations at Damariscove, Monhegan and other islands in the decade prior to the Pilgrims' landing at Plymouth. The Pilgrims avoided starvation at the end of the winter of 1621-22 only by turning to Damariscove for food, and the later Puritan experiment at Massachusetts Bay was underwritten by its own fishing stations, leading 18th-century New England leaders to put the image of the cod on their coins and buildings.
"The members of the 'codfish aristocracy,' those who traced their family fortunes to the 17th-century cod fisheries, had openly worshiped the fish as the symbol of their wealth," Mark Kurlansky wrote in "Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World." "The Boston Town Hall ... had a gilded cod hanging from the ceiling (and) ... after the American Revolution a carved wooden cod was hung in the Old State House" as if overseeing the commonwealth's proceedings.
If anything, fishing had an even greater impact on Maine, where cod remained plentiful close to shore right into the 20th century. Using logbooks, a University of New Hampshire team led by maritime historian Karen Alexander reconstructed the 1861 catch of the small sailboat fleet operating out of a handful of hamlets between Blue Hill and Winter Harbor. Using baited hooks and hand-held lines, these day fishermen caught nearly 10,000 metric tons of cod -- more than the entire modern U.S. fleet in the Gulf of Maine was able to land between 1996 and 1999 with their powerful engines, enormous bottom-trawling nets and high-tech fish finders. The researchers estimated the overall 1861 catch in the U.S. part of the gulf at 78,600 metric tons.
This year's fishing quota is just 386 metric tons because so few cod remain, the result of overfishing in the late 20th century and the failure of the stock to fully rebound -- a result, it is thought, of the temperature changes. "The warm water is absolutely not making things easy for the cod," Pershing says.
Because it has been fed regularly by frigid currents originating in the Arctic, the gulf is home to a range of northern and subarctic species that could not thrive south of Cape Cod, where the warm Gulf Stream holds sway: cod, salmon, herring, mackerel, lobsters and a protein-packed, rice-sized copepod called Calanus finmarchicus, on which many other species rely. The cold kept pathogens away, and was too hardy for annoying creatures such as green crabs and jellyfish to take hold.
All that has been changing over the past decade, starting with the incoming currents from Canada. "There's been a marked change in the deep water coming into the Northeast Channel," says John Hare, a biological oceanographer and director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northeast Fisheries Science laboratory in Narragansett, Rhode Island. "There's much less of the colder Labrador water and more of the warmer water coming in from the (continental) slope."
This is likely a result of the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and ice from the Arctic Ocean over the past two decades, which has dumped huge quantities of very cold freshwater into the Labrador Sea, changing the arrangement of ocean currents. David Townsend, a biological oceanographer at the University of Maine who studies the phenomenon, says the localized effect has been the shifting of the extremely cold Labrador Slope Current away from the Gulf of Maine, resulting in greater deep-water inflows of warmer water coming up from the Gulf Stream to the south.
Temperature variability always has been a characteristic of the Gulf of Maine, which always has experienced three or five years of warmer temperatures followed by a similar period of cooler ones. We're still seeing that today, Townsend notes, based on pulses of cold water that still come down the coast of Nova Scotia and inhibit deeper continental slope water from entering our region. The difference in recent years is that when the Scotia current lulls, the slope water that pours in is far warmer than it once was.
"For reasons that we do not understand, there is less Labrador Slope water sitting outside the entrance to the Northeast Channel than there used to be," he says, helping drive the past decade's temperature spike in the Gulf of Maine.
What happens next "upstream" from us in Canadian waters is anyone's guess. Annual reports on the state of the Atlantic Canadian marine ecosystem produced by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans indicate above-normal surface- and bottom-water temperatures for several years running and record-breaking levels in some areas in 2012, including the eastern half of the Gulf of Maine. Catherine Johnson, of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Halifax, said the reasons for the warming of the deep water were not entirely clear, nor was it well understood how these effects would work their way down the shelf.
A half-dozen other Canadian government scientists who worked on the marine ecosystem assessment and other research relevant to the warming of the Gulf of Maine either did not respond to interview requests or could not obtain permission to speak to a reporter about them, and obtaining permission to speak to Johnson about her work took two months.
Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, government scientists have long been prevented from discussing climate change-related research with journalists -- sometimes unable even to answer questions about their own scientific papers in the public domain -- prompting protests across Canada and hampering efforts to integrate information across the Gulf of Maine. But on Oct. 19, Harper's Conservative Party lost the nation's federal election to the Liberals, who have pledged to change the policy after they are sworn in Nov. 4.
Amid the 10-year warming trend, the 2012 "ocean heat wave" stood out. Researchers think they've figured out why that year was so unusual, providing some indications of how likely the conditions are to repeat themselves.
During the winter of 2011-12, an already warming gulf was subject to unusually warm air temperatures, courtesy of the unusual behavior of the jet stream, the shifting front between cold Arctic and temperate continental air masses. "What was so peculiar was that the jet stream just locked in place for weeks at a time in a pattern that had warm air up above Quebec City all winter, and people were going around in their T-shirts in January," says Glen Gawarkiewicz, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who helped unlock the puzzle. "Normally that warm air would have been south of Maryland."
As a result, the gulf never properly cooled down. In the first half of the year, water temperatures across the gulf and down to 150 feet or more were about 4 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they usually were; in some places there was an 8-degree spike. Things warmed further through the summer, sending shock waves throughout the ecosystem.
Unfortunately, Gawarkiewicz says, the jet stream is still behaving strangely, getting stuck in place for long stretches of winter instead of undulating along over Maine, providing deep chills and brief thaws. The difference is that in the past three winters the jet stream has stalled with the Northeastern United States stuck in the cold and the western United States in sustained warmth, whereas the opposite was true in 2011-12. "Fundamentally, the dynamics of the jet stream are changing, and we're not sure why," he says.
Meanwhile, climate models predict atmospheric temperatures will continue to increase in New England in the coming decades, with average surface temperatures reaching 4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit higher in 2050 then they are today, according to Massachusetts' Climate Change Adaptation Advisory Committee. Average summer sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine region will increase by about 5.5 degrees -- a rate of just over 0.1 degree a year -- between now and 2065, according to projections averaging the results of six independent models by a team led by John Loder, an ocean modeler at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, a Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans research institute in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.
That's less than the past decade's unusually steep average rate (0.4 degrees Fahrenheit a year) but twice as fast as the 30-year warming trend in the gulf (0.054 per year). If the projections are accurate, sea temperatures comparable to 2012's could be the "new normal" by 2050.
Preliminary modeling by Canadian scientists of the ecosystem effects of a 1.8-degree Fahrenheit increase in average sea surface temperatures in our region over the next 50 years predicted a reduction in the total mass of all creatures currently living in the region of 19 percent to 29 percent. The biggest factors, says co-author Sylvie Guenette, a fisheries biologist in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, were marked declines in phytoplankton and Calanus finmarchicus, which would trigger steep declines in cod, herring, lobster and other species. "This model is a first attempt, and there's a lot of uncertainty in this," she says, not least the fact that since it was created in 2009, predictions of how much the Gulf of Maine would heat up have more than tripled.
While nobody knows for sure what all this will mean for marine life and the coastal economy, 2012 provided a sobering glimpse into a warmer future.
That May, lobster fishermen were shocked to encounter strong runs of newly shedded lobsters, six weeks ahead of their usual schedule. "Nobody knew what was happening, just that there were lobsters to catch," says Islesford lobsterman David Thomas. "It kind of rattled everybody's cage and made a big economic problem."
Maine lobstermen were pulling up mountains of soft-shell lobsters, but dealers had nowhere to send them. The Maritimes processing plants that usually purchase the lion's share were still busy with the spring harvest from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The price plummeted until it got so low the processors reconsidered, buying up the glut of cheap Maine lobsters instead of local lobsters, prompting eastern New Brunswick lobstermen to blockade trucks of Maine lobsters to prevent them from unloading. Police tactical teams responded to calls for help from lobster plants that had been surrounded by hundreds of angry lobstermen.
Meanwhile, the warmer water triggered an explosion in the population of green crabs, which proceeded to devour most of the clams in Freeport, Brunswick, Penobscot and other towns. "Green crabs were literally boiling up out of the ocean," says Freeport clammer Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association. "They ate everything, all the sea grass, tearing up the shore."
Marissa McMahan, now a doctoral student at Northeastern University, was lobstering with her father off Georgetown that summer and was surprised to find a large, stout-bodied gray-and-black fish in a trap. "I had to ask him what it was -- a black sea bass -- and he'd only seen four or five in his 40-plus years on the water," she says. By the end of the summer they'd caught nearly 20 of the warm-water bottom fish, which normally live off New Jersey and Delaware. "Fishermen up and down the coast were seeing the same thing."
On Eastern Egg Rock, puffin chicks starved because their parents were unable to find appropriate food for them; while off Grand Manan Island, northern right whales failed to find swarms of Calanus finmarchicus to eat.
Cod, which fishermen had hoped were recovering from the overfishing of the late 20th century, were found to be in bad shape across the region, with very few young fish present in either the interior of the gulf or Georges Bank. Fishing quotas in the interior gulf were cut by 80 percent that year, and as bad news continued to roll in, the fishery was essentially closed in 2014, with federal regulators estimating the stock at less than 4 percent of the level deemed sustainable.
While 2012 was the warmest year on record, the ecosystem has been responding to the rapid warming of the past decade as well.
William Balch, of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, has documented a reduction in the growth of phytoplankton, the microscopic plants at the base of the food chain. Each month in the growing season since 1998, Balch and his colleagues have surveyed the tiny plants from the Nova Star and its predecessor ferries as they cross the gulf from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, to Portland. (When ferry service was interrupted, they used other vessels.) The readings were constant until 2007, when they saw phytoplankton concentrations fall by about three-quarters, where they've stayed ever since.
Why? Balch thinks it's because of increased precipitation, which has substantially increased river flows into the gulf. This water is laden with tea-colored dissolved organic matter that happens to absorb sunlight in the same wavelengths craved by the phytoplankton, essentially cutting off their energy supply. The reduced flow of deep, cold Labrador water into the gulf -- a key source of silicate, a nutrient needed by some types of phytoplankton -- may have compounded the problem.
"It's a double whammy when you lower a plant's light and its nutrients," he says. (Disclosure: This reporter is a Bigelow trustee.)
Maine and the region are poorly prepared for the challenges ahead, with critical scientific programs having been cut by Congress and the Canadian Parliament and climate change planning having been assigned a low priority under the administration of Maine Gov. Paul LePage.
"Changes are coming. It's inevitable," says Lou Van Guelpen, curator of fishes at the Huntsman Marine Science Center in St. Andrews, New Brunswick. "We don't really know what their effects will be, but they're happening faster and they're happening now."

Full text:   Dubois says business legit; DEP, town says farm emitting a 'nuisance odor', without permit
A putrid stench that has permeated parts of York County since Tuesday is coming from a farm and composting business in Arundel that is operating in violation of local and state rules, officials said.
However, a company official said the business owners are merely trying to keep their hay fields healthy by covering them with a combination of compost and chicken manure. He blamed adverse weather conditions for the smell and said the business is operating within its rights.
Dubois Livestock & Excavating Inc. at 2 Irving Road treated its hay fields with a material that created the odor, according to Mike Clark, an environmental specialist with the state Department of Environmental Protection, who visited the Dubois property Wednesday to follow up on numerous complaints.
"They refused to talk to me," Clark said. "They refused to let me on the premises."
Clark believes the material spread on the fields is mostly compost, which in itself is not a violation. However, DEP rules say compost must be sufficiently cured so it does not create a "nuisance odor."
Since Dubois refused to let him inspect the site, Clark said the DEP is determining what its next step will be toward getting the business to comply with state rules.
"We prefer voluntary compliance," he said, "but voluntary compliance starts with communication."
Sol Fedder, an officer and director of Dubois, said the compost has been cured to reduce the odor, and that easterly winds and a lack of rain are what caused the smell to spread and linger.
"We have to use something to make the grass grow," he said. "If we had something that smelled nicer, we'd use that."
Dubois also is in violation of a town ordinance for operating its composting business on an expired conditional use permit, Arundel Town Planner Tad Redway said.
The town decided not to renew the permit in 2011 after Dubois refused to comply with certain required conditions, according to documents filed in Maine Supreme Judicial Court. When Dubois did not cease its composting operations, the town sued and won in York County Superior Court.
The business appealed the decision to the supreme court, arguing that the town did not have proper jurisdiction to bar it from operating, but the court again ruled in favor of Arundel.
Still, Dubois has not stopped making compost. Its website touts the business as "Maine's largest agricultural compost facility" and promotes the fact that its compost includes shellfish. The company also raises pigs and rabbits, sells firewood and offers excavation and demolition services. Customer testimonials on the site praise the quality of Dubois' compost and topsoil.
But neighbors say the periodic stench has been getting worse in recent months, and that they have had enough. One group of nearby residents, who asked not to be named, has been distributing fliers encouraging others to file complaints with local and state officials.
"We encourage you to call these folks whenever you have had enough of the stink and make your concerns known," the fliers say. "Call, and keep calling every time you are offended by the smell until the town and state authorities take a stand and hold Dubois accountable."
Arundel Town Manager Keith Trefethen said the town is not giving up. It has filed a second lawsuit against Dubois and Randrick Trust, the legal entity that owns the business, in an effort to enforce the previous court order.
"Right now they have no permit," Trefethen said. "The remedy we have is to go back to court."
Fedder said a new amendment to the Maine Agriculture Protection Act that takes effect Monday should exempt Dubois from town ordinances, which is what the business plans to argue in court.
"There's nothing wrong with what we're doing, and it's exactly right what we're doing," he said.
He said Dubois did not allow DEP to inspect its fields Wednesday because its owners have a long-standing "personal dispute" with Clark, the environmental specialist.
"We've had a history with the DEP guy," he said.
But Clark said there is nothing personal about it, and that it is merely a case of one company refusing to comply with state rules.
"They don't like being regulated -- they've made that clear," he said.

Full text:   REAL MAINE FOOD: 100 PLATES FROM FISHERMEN, FARMERS, PIE CHAMPS AND CLAM SHACKS
By Ben Conniff and Luke Holden
Rizzoli, 2015
223 pages, $35
When I first learned to cook, even the dogs left town. But then, I didn't have Ben Conniff and Luke Holden's new cookbook to help me.
These two young restaurateurs (Holden is from Maine; Conniff is not) own Luke's Lobster Shacks, which feature Maine recipes and Maine-sourced products. "Real Maine Foods" is their well-packaged and fun effort to proudly promote "Maine's edible bounty."
The book has four chapters emphasizing shellfish, fin fish, farm products (meats, vegetables, fruits) and Maine-grown grains. "From the Shell" offers recipes for lobster, crab, shrimp, clams, scallops, oysters and mussels. This chapter also includes fascinating information and recipes using kelp, "a nutritional goldmine." Learn here how to make a rich, flavorful lobster broth for lobster stew.
"From the Line" showcases recipes for sea bass, bluefish, haddock, mackerel, salmon and smelt, and includes a wonderful recipe for Portuguese fish stew and a handy sidebar, "How to Clean a Whole Fish."
The chapter on farm products highlights pork, corned beef and lamb, as well as potatoes, beans, kale, butternut squash, apples and blueberries. Sidebars tell of the 24 varieties of potatoes grown at the Wood Prairie Farm in Bridgewater, and of the Heritage apples at Palermo's Super Chilly Apple Farm.
The chapter on grains describes Maine-grown grains milled at the Somerset Grist Mill in Skowhegan -- such as wheat, buckwheat, rye and rolled oats -- and used in recipes for Johnny cakes, ployes, pancakes, pie crusts, doughnuts, scones and tarts.
Short essays also tell of obscure Maine food product producers such as the aquaculture efforts of True North Salmon, North Haven Oysters and Bands Island Mussels, as well as Stonington Seafood's smoked finnan haddie and the Abenaki flint corn grown at the Songbird Farm in Starks.
The recipes are elegantly simple and are uniquely Maine, and that equals good eating.
THE FISHERMAN
By Vaughn Hardacker
Skyhorse Publishing, 2015
336 pages, $16.99

Maine has some excellent crime-thriller writers and Vaughn Hardacker is turning out to be one of them.
"The Fisherman" is his fifth thriller, following "Sniper" (Skyhorse, 2014). Hardacker lives in Stockholm, Maine, where he puts together interesting plots with cop crime action and colorful characters.
This is not really a mystery; rather, it is a crime-thriller. Early on the reader knows all the players and their motives, so the story then follows a violent collision course between the good guys and the bad guys, with the reader watching all the fast-paced moves to see how high the body count will be at the end. And it's got a terrific, exciting ending.
Hardacker has a good ear for dialogue and a good eye for action, weaving a creepy plot with a serial killer's diabolical plans and the detectives' desperate investigative moves.
Dozens of women have disappeared from Boston's streets and nobody seems to care. After all, prostitutes, drug addicts and the homeless are disposable, hardly missed. They are the perfect targets of a determined killer called the Fisherman.
Retired Boston homicide cops Mike Houston and Anne Bouchard are now private detectives living in Maine. They find themselves searching for a missing Boston hooker, revealing a much larger and more deadly case than they ever dreamed.
Their investigation is complicated, so they ask an old Boston mobster pal, Jimmy O'Leary, for his unique brand of help. Jimmy is resourceful, efficient and brutal, but he does get results. Now, however, Mike and Anne are locked in a life-or-death struggle with the Fisherman, and Jimmy is in a war with the Russian mafia.
Clever detective work, surprising twists, miraculous escapes and a coolly proficient sniper make this a fun, lethal read.
Hardacker's next thriller will be "Black Orchid" in 2016.

Full text:   OUR ROUTINES DON'T take us down to the fresh ruffles of the surf very often these days, but somehow, the sea is always with me. When I was a kid I lived whole summers digging and scattering sand on beaches in Casco Bay. And more often I poked around in low-tide pools and algaes baking on damp ledges, and malingered under wharves funky with kelp and bait smells.
Down in that gloomy intertidal no-man's-land, periwinkles were everywhere. They dotted the rocks and pilings, inhabited the seaweed. To a kid they were as motionless as stones and practically inanimate, even though you knew they were alive. Six or eight of them might be arrayed in a trapezoidal shape on a flat spur of ledge, then if you wandered away and later returned, the trapezoid had turned into a U. How did they do that, and when?
Barnacles don't move at all. They cement their heads directly onto the rock and stay there, but periwinkles suction themselves to flat surfaces at their shell aperture, and shove one foot out to push around, typical of gastropods -- a class of mollusks with spiral shells. Periwinkles have soft bodies and a head inside the permanent univalve shell (as opposed to bivalves like clams, scallops and mussels). South of New England there are tremendous varieties of periwinkle kin, from whelks, cowries, conchs and murexes, to wentletraps, tritons and augers. Don't ask me to identify these creatures I've mostly only read about and have no karmic links to. That I know of.
The three main periwinkle species I had a firsthand relationship with as a kid look a lot alike: the common periwinkle (Littorina littorea); the rough periwinkle (L. saxatilis); and the smooth periwinkle (L. obtusata). The common periwinkle has a purple-brown shell, with fewer color variations than the others. The rough periwinkle has deeper ridges in its shell. And the smooth periwinkle tends to look shinier and is often banded and brighter-colored in green and yellow.
The common periwinkles, believe it or not, are an invasive species. The first report of their presence in North America was near Pictou, Nova Scotia, in the 1840s.
They appear to have come from Ireland and Scotland, according to a study led by University of Maine marine biologist Susan Brawley, probably on ballast rock picked up in Britain and discharged in the Maritimes. Or possibly they were deliberately transplanted for food. They expanded their new range rapidly, and are now found from Labrador to Delaware, in addition to their original digs on Northern Europe's coasts.
They scrape algae off rocks and seaweed with a tooth-riddled contraption called a radula, which sticks out of the same aperture as the foot. There are so many of them off our coast that they sometimes devour all the competitors of Irish moss, which takes over in places, disrupting the ecosystem. Life is hazardous in the intertidal zone, and even nastier as you cross the line into the deeper water where their larger cousins the whelks are outright carnivorous.
Periwinkles have sensory organs for feel, smell and taste, and there's a legend that humming a tune can induce it to open its operculum, or aperture cover, though I've never tried this and couldn't find a scientific website that mentions it. It seems too civilized to be true, but some of my co-workers say they've seen it happen.
In Europe and Asia, periwinkles, aka snails, are still commonly eaten, and they've been harvested for those markets by Down East "wrinklers" in considerable quantities since about the late 1980s. One year nearly 4 million pounds were taken. More recently the harvest has approached about 1 million pounds a year, according to state figures.
Unless you crush a periwinkle or bore a hole in its shell, the tight-sealed aperture is the only way into it. Years ago, a friend who studied nutritional self-sufficiency experimented with collecting periwinkles on the shore in Portland and boiling them. They're easier to gather than clams, but eating them turns out to be labor-intensive. The cooked periwinkle meat is hard to dig out without breaking the shell and getting bites full of shards. Unless you're a green crab, which crushes them in its claw and discards the pieces.
I relate all this gathered-up information from one sort of distance or another. For as I say, we don't make many voyages to the shore nowadays and I don't have the same consanguinities with periwinkles that I have with, say, chickadees. So the fascination goes back to chthonic memories, bleached by time and the elements, of shell shucks under low-tide wharves, when it barely registered to me that they were even alive. They were small creeping stones with trap doors.
Back across the line in the daylight world of sun-beaten waves it might have occurred to me you could gather them up and eat them, the way they were eating algae, and algae were eating sunlight. But regretfully I did not contrive that kind of conquest. They were just more bait. It takes some distance to clear up what it means to say the bottom of the sea is cruel.

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it -- their favorite inns, restaurants, trips, activities, experiences, travel books and websites -- in their own personal style. They offer anecdotes, tips and the details you need. Join them in exploring the great state of Maine.
I had no idea just how big Pineland Farms is until I read that it encompassed 5,000 acres of land. Trust us, it is big enough to get lost in. It became much clearer once we found a large model of Pineland's layout on display at the market. This diverse business campus and educational and recreational venue is impressive.
We visited Pineland for one of their Graze dinners, and had arrived early to explore. I insisted on finding the garden I'd read about. The perennial, herb and vegetable garden at Pineland Farms has wonderful paths winding artfully around the plantings. Seeing artichokes happily growing in Maine was a sight. Vegetables grown here are sold at the market and gardening seminars are offered in the summer.
Once you enter the market at Pineland Farms, you'll be drawn in by the amazing smell of great food. Fresh soups, sandwiches and salads are prepared at the cafe using ingredients sourced right from the farm. Pineland Farms natural meats, Pineland cheese and grocery items from many Maine companies fill the store.
Olivia's Garden is also a business located at Pineland Farms. They grow top-quality lettuce, micro-greens, basil and tomatoes hydroponically all year. They were the first to grow hydroponic vegetables on such a massive scale, supplying many of Maine's markets and restaurants. They were also featured at the Graze dinner.
The Graze dinners are outdoors in a massive events tent. A bluegrass band, Gather Rounders, set the upbeat mood and one could enjoy a drink during the social hour. But it was the center table loaded with amazing amounts of Pineland cheese, dips, crostini and salsas that was the hot spot. I could have made my entire meal from this table. But this was a meal of abundance, and soon the more substantial appetizers were being circulated by servers. Items like lobster salad on fried green tomatoes and crab and corn fritters came -- and the main dinner was still to come.
The chilled horseradish beet soup sip was the star of the first course offerings for me. People sitting all around us concurred.
Dinner itself was served family-style. We were surprised to see seven dishes being served. My favorites were the Panzanella Salad with their fresh tomatoes, the braised pork ribs with a peach and rum barbecue sauce, and the root vegetable hash.
And just when I thought I would not eat another bite, out came cookies with a decadent warm chocolate dipping sauce. One might think it's just women who adore chocolate, but I witnessed grown men fighting over the rest of that sauce even when the cookies were gone. Yes, my husband was one of them.
OK, guilty as charged, although the guy across the table from me got most of the chocolate sauce because he was using a spoon.
I enjoyed a talk before dinner with Jason Burnham, of Maine Shellfish Company, about their effort to promote the use of under-utilized fish species, including "shark bites" (bits of dogfish), and was delighted to find staff members of the wonderful Bridgewater Winery in Owls Head at our table. Their wine was featured at the dinner, along with Allagash microbrews. Yes, I was a very happy man.
Pineland Farms' mission is "to provide a productive and educational venue that enriches the community by demonstrating responsible farming techniques, offering educational opportunities and encouraging a healthy lifestyle through recreation." Well, I learned a lot at this dinner.
For example, confused by the first course, I asked Linda, "How do you eat this?" Turns out you were supposed to drink the beet soup. It was awesome. I also learned it is OK to enjoy a muffin as a first course -- but it's doubtful I'll be allowed to do this at home. For the record, I liked every single thing we tried. Black Tie Catering prepared the meal and it was memorable.
You still have time to get to a Graze dinner before they shut down for the winter, and each dinner is unique. On Sept. 23 they'll offer "The American Dinner" and on Oct. 7 "Autumn's Bounty." You can buy tickets on their website and also read about many of the farm's other events. Family Farmyard Fun, scheduled in the Education Barn on Sept. 17 and 22 and Oct. 8, in which you "meet the animals close up," sounded like a great event for kids.

Full text:   SEARSPORT -- The BBC Amber is at the dock on an early August afternoon, unloading wind turbine tower segments bound for the Passadumkeag Mountain wind project in Grand Falls Township, 70 miles to the north.
At 14,000 tons, it is a relatively small vessel, drawing just 24 feet on arrival, and was able to transit the channel to Searsport, at the head of Penobscot Bay, without concern for the 10-foot tides or high spots, where as much as 4 feet of silt has fallen into the channel since it was last dredged a half century ago. But on both the day before and the day that followed, two 23,000-ton oil tankers had been forced to wait for a rising tide to proceed into the port, where oil, gasoline, road salt, wood pulp and other cargo are offloaded, much of it bound for the landlocked interior.
However, an extensive dredging project proposed to improve and upgrade Maine's second-busiest port has raised alarm bells up and down Penobscot Bay, where fishermen, shellfish farmers, owners of tourism-dependent businesses, and environmentalists fear it will trigger an ecological and economic catastrophe.
"If you sat down and tried to find a way to guarantee you would contaminate the entire food web with methyl mercury, they've come up with it," said Kim Ervin Tucker, the Lincolnville attorney representing many of the opponents, including local lobstermen, businesspeople and the Sierra Club. "You can accomplish the project's goals in a smarter, cheaper way that doesn't put existing lobstering and tourism and other industries at risk."
The port, created in 1964 when ships were smaller and safety requirements laxer, is long overdue for an upgrade, said David Gelinas, president of the local pilots' association, who is thrilled that the Army Corps of Engineers has proposed to improve the approaches to the port, deepening the design depth from 35 to 40 feet and substantially widening the turning basin.
Anything less, Gelinas says, will compromise the port's long-term survival. "Economically, it's a slow strangulation," he says. "If you're stuck back in the '60s, you won't be a very competitive port very long in the future."
John Henshaw, director of the Maine Port Authority, predicts the upgrades would help attract new business to the port and the vast tracts of central and northern Maine it serves via railroad connections that run right to the bulk cargo dock. Look to the proposed wood chip plant in Prospect, he said, which would employ dozens and export its product to Europe from Searsport.
Opponents of the project -- which has to obtain permits from the state Department of Environmental Protection to proceed -- question whether it needs to be as extensive as the Army Corps of Engineers has proposed, especially given the environmental risks.
At issue are the waste products: nearly a million cubic yards of material to be dredged from the port area, at least some of which is contaminated with mercury and other toxins released by polluters along the Penobscot River, the mouth of which is next to the port.
The area to be dredged is 3 miles west of the mouth of the Penobscot River, where state authorities have banned lobster and crab fishing since February 2014 after crustaceans in the area were found to have high levels of mercury in their flesh.
The lobsters and crabs had been tested as a result of a court order in a federal suit against the former owners of the HoltraChem plant in Orrington, a bleach-making facility that released large quantities of mercury directly into the river between 1967 and 1982. On Wednesday, a judge ordered the firm that owned the plant at that time, Mallinckrodt, to pay for an engineering study on how to remove the toxic heavy metal from the lower 20 miles of the river, a project estimated to cost $130 million.
Kevin Yeager, the University of Kentucky geologist who served as the court-appointed sedimentation expert in the HoltraChem case, issued a report in July 2014 taking the Corps to task for relying on faulty testing of the sediments in the Searsport dredge area.
According to project documents, the Corps wants to remove the most contaminated material -- surface material with high levels of heavy metals and polycyclic hydrocarbons -- and dump them into a series of deep, cone-shaped pockmarks in the bay's floor halfway between Islesboro and the Northport shore. They would then cover them with cleaner dredge material, sealing it away from the environment.
The Corps has argued that the sediments are suitable for disposal at the western Penobscot Bay site. Officials at the Corps' New England regional office said they could not respond to critics' comments at this time.
Given the contamination, many around Penobscot Bay fear the proposed disposal site is not an appropriate place for it.
Joe Kelley, of the University of Maine, a former state geologist who has mapped the bay's bottom, has said the pockmarks are geologically unstable and formed by the venting of methane gas. Scouring by ocean currents probably would resuspend any material stored in them. At a June 9 hearing, he testified that the Corps in fact knew this, and in the 1990s had rejected them as a suitable place to dump dredge spoils in the 1990s.
"I was surprised by this (new) proposal in light of the prior rejection of this area ... and the known risks of using this area for this purpose," he stated. "The possibility of resuspension of buried contaminants, including HoltraChem-contaminated material, makes the use of pockmarks in this area even more dangerous, and threatens the reputation for wholesomeness of all Penobscot Bay fishing resources."
Armindy McFadden, who manages a Lincolnville Beach restaurant and co-owns a Northport mussel farm located just 5,000 feet from the proposed disposal site, said it's an outrageous idea. "Generations of people have been dumping stuff in that harbor and now they want to put it in a 400-foot methane hole that geologists have said for 20 years is too terrible to use," she said.
"People aren't going to come here if the think the bay is polluted, and if the brand name of Maine lobster is tainted in any way, shape or form, then our entire economy in Maine as we know it is going to be affected," she added. "This is the first time the Sierra Club and the lobstermen and all these businesses have been on the same page. This is one central issue that this entire area feels strongly about."
Steve Miller, executive director of the Islesboro Islands Trust - which is intervening against the project before the DEP - agrees. "The science is telling us the material would probably be redistributed in the water column and carried south over lobster feeding areas and so forth," he said. "It's an experiment, and we don't want to be treated like a guinea pig up here."
Belfast lobster fisherman David Black, who fishes the area around the proposed disposal site, said area lobsterman fear the destruction of the fishery. "We understand that dredging is an important part of keeping working waterfronts open on the coast of Maine," Black said. "However, we don't like the idea of dropping a million cubic yards of dredge spoils right in the middle of upper Penobscot Bay.
"There is an alternative which is much less environmentally damaging than the one they are propoising," he added.
Black and the other opponents want the DEP to reject the plan, arguing the port's needs can be met under an alternate scheme that would dredge about one-10th as much material, reducing the danger of contamination. This proposal would deepen the berth at the Searsport dock but would not expand the turning basin or deepen the channel beyond 35 feet.
They have been urging the DEP to consider the plan - created by Dawson & Associates, a Washington, D.C., consultancy focusing on Corps projects - which they say would be cheaper and would allow the port to meet current traffic needs, even if some vessels have to play the tides. "We're not objecting to bringing in deeper-draft vessels; we say you can bring them in in a smarter, cheaper way without stirring up the mercury everyone knows is there," attorney Tucker said.
Port interests are unimpressed with the "Dawson alternative." Henshaw, the state's ports director, called it "a recipe for the status quo."
"Essentially, you're saying that you don't even want to accommodate the existing traffic, and we'd see declines of traffic over time," he added.
The project requires DEP permits to proceed, and outgoing DEP Commissioner Patricia Aho has said for months that she intends to hold adjudicatory hearing on the project, but has yet to announced a date. Department spokesperson David Madore said the department couldn't discuss the project because it would "compromise the integrity of the hearing process."
An official at the state Department of Marine Resources said staff members there were compiling a report for DEP on how the project would affect area fisheries, and that it would be completed in several weeks.
The Searsport project manager at the Army Corps of Engineer's New England District Office in Concord, Massachusetts, Barbabra Blumeris, also said she couldn't comment, apart from describing the process. Even if the project receives DEP approval, she said, it still had a number of hurdles to cross: approval from an internal review board and the agency's chief of engineers, authorization from Congress, appropriation of congressional funds, the design of the detailed engineering plan, and sending the project out to bid.
Even in the best case scenario, she said, the project is unlikely to start earlier than November 2018. "We have lots of work to do," she noted.

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it -- their favorite inns, restaurants, trips, activities, experiences, travel books and websites -- in their own personal style. They offer anecdotes, tips and the details you need. Join them in exploring the great state of Maine.
A new executive chef at The Looking Glass Restaurant in Bar Harbor was our excuse to return to one of our favorite restaurants in July, with family in tow. But really, you don't need an excuse to dine here. Both the outside deck and the inside dining room, surrounded by full-length windows, provide an amazing ocean view from high on the hill behind the Blue Nose Inn, where son Joshua, daughter-in-law Kelly, and 16-month-old granddaughter Ada were spending the week.
Our daughter Rebekah drove up from Union to spend the day with us. An afternoon at the spectacular Thuya Gardens in Northeast Harbor put us in the best of moods, as we eagerly anticipated a great dinner. New chef Matt McPherson has cooked all over the country, from Alaska to the Florida Keys, and he's made the menu here his own.
We enjoyed a brief visit with Matt, talking mostly about Alaska, where he cooked at a restaurant right outside Denali National Park. Linda and I enjoyed a wonderful trip to Denali and shared some of our memories with Matt.
Matt is focused on local food and has created his own impressive garden just outside the restaurant. Jim Ash, co-owner and general manager of the restaurant and inn, told us how pleased he's been with Matt's menu and food. By the time we were finished eating here, we fully agreed.
While some of the menu items are typical, Matt has added his own creative flare to each and every one. With five adults and Ada at our table, we got to try a lot of things, and honestly, we enjoyed every single one. For the record, our appetizers were Oyster Rockefeller, crab cakes, lobster fritters, wild mushroom tart and roasted beet salad. Yum!
I had the Oyster Rockefeller, six local Taunton Bay oysters stuffed and baked with smoked bacon, watercress, garlic, onion, pernod and bechamel, with a gruyere cheese and herb crumb topping. It was really, really good.
Our entrees included halibut, lobster mac and cheese, scallops, pistachio herb falafel and wild mushroom risotto. What a feast. I had the scallops, locally caught and pan-seared over fava bean sauce, with applewood smoked bacon, grilled corn, green onion, fennel, radish and citrus zest. Like most of the entrees, this was gluten-free. I savored it while sampling all the other dishes. I was quite surprised to find that I really loved Rebekah's wild mushroom risotto, and Kelly's halibut was spectacular.
We were neglectful parents, never having taken our kids to Bar Harbor when they were growing up. I didn't realize this until Josh said he'd never been, reminding me that we'd always avoided busy places when it was time for a vacation, many of which we spent at our camp in the north woods.
Josh and Kelly don't have that aversion to crowds, so they planned a week in Bar Harbor this summer, staying at the Blue Nose Inn. Josh and Kelly especially liked the fact that the inn has both indoor and outdoor pools to keep our little granddaughter busy. And they looked forward to exploring Mount Desert Island and Acadia National Park, beautiful places for sure.
At Thuya Gardens in Northeast Harbor, we oohed and aahed over the vibrant colors of the gardens while Ada toddled around. And then we headed to our favorite local restaurant, The Looking Glass. The view is spectacular and so was our dinner. It was fun to have so many people at the table, because we could order many different appetizers and entrees and share them all. Not only is the new chef's menu varied, but his preparations are artfully prepared and beautifully presented.
Ada waited patiently and was very excited to get her kid's mac and cheese, exclaiming "Ooooh" when it arrived. Kelly noted that there was a good variety of dishes for kids beyond the usual fare. Ada's dinner was made with smoked gouda, which she happily enjoyed.
I had to order the pistachio herb falafel because it had all my favorites in it: quinoa tabbouleh, baby Brussels sprouts, tahini yogurt sauce, and incredible pan-fried falafel. This offering, like many others on the menu, was gluten-free.
After dinner, Rebekah had to head home, but the rest of us strolled down the hill to the Blue Nose, where Bill Trowell was playing the piano in the lounge, something he's been doing for a remarkable 25 years. His music is magical and always a highlight of our trips here. George purchased more of Bill's CDs for us and for Josh and Kelly, so we all took a little bit of Bar Harbor home with us.
The next day, to help Josh and Kelly enjoy some kayaking and exploring with a lunch on their own, George and I baby-sat Ada. Well, it turns out that Ada is happiest with us when we put her in the stroller and walk (and walk and walk). We walked Bar Harbor's spectacular 1-mile shoreline trail, turned around and walked back. By the end of the day, we'd covered over 5 miles because, whenever she woke up and we took her out of the carriage, she let us know that she wasn't going to be happy unless we were moving along.
Whether you are moving along, or sitting in the pool at the Blue Nose or dining at The Looking Glass, you'll enjoy a trip here, too.

Full text:   Former King adviser to head federal agency
PORTLAND -- A former adviser to Angus King when he served as Maine's governor has been selected to lead the Federal Highway Administration.
Greg Nadeau has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate to the post. The announcement was made Thursday by King and fellow Sen. Susan Collins.
Nadeau, a native of Lewiston, served as senior policy adviser to then-Gov. King from 1992 to 2002. He has served as the Federal Highway Administration's deputy administrator since 2009.
Nadeau also served as the Maine Department of Transportation's deputy commissioner for policy, planning and communications until 2009. He previously represented Lewiston in the Maine House of Representatives from 1978-1990.
He was nominated by President Barack Obama for the position of administrator on May 11.
Pingree in delegation touring Ukraine
KIEV, Ukraine -- U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is continuing her overseas meeting in Ukraine.
The Maine Democrat is part of a congressional delegation that met Thursday with President Petro Poroshenko, the prime minister, members of parliament and others.
A day earlier, Pingree put flowers at a memorial at Maidan Square to honor demonstrators killed during political protests leading to the Ukrainian revolution of 2014. Pingree said it's important that the U.S. retains a strong relationship "at this critical time for national security and in light of Russia's increasing aggression."
Ukrainian security officials renewed their request for U.S. weapons while meeting with the delegation. The U.S. has provided training and non-lethal aid, but has stopped short of supplying weapons to the Ukraine for its fight against Russian-backed separatists.
Authorities search for Long Island man
LONG ISLAND -- Authorities are asking for the public's help in their search for a Long Island man who has been missing since Sunday.
Cumberland County Lt. Donald Foss said 31-year-old Dana Moy left messages for his family and friends indicating that they would not find him alive.
Moy was last seen riding his bike Sunday on Long Island. Police say his boat, a white 2005 Carolina Skiff, was missing from its marina slip.
Foss said Moy stands 5 feet, 10 inches tall, weighs 185 pounds and has brown hair and blue eyes.
The Coast Guard and the Marine Patrol are assisting Cumberland County authorities in their search.
Coastal communities get funds for projects
AUGUSTA -- Officials are giving out close to $250,000 for projects on Maine's coast that will support shellfish harvesting, increased public access and revitalizing downtowns.
The state is awarding grants to 11 projects. The largest grant is going to the town of Brunswick, which is receiving $47,925 for an assessment of the Mare Brook watershed.
The grant money comes from an award by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

Full text:   A dry spring has made for an itchy, scratchy summer along Maine's coast, the result of a bumper crop of browntail moths. And a state entomologist said Thursday that the worst conditions in a decade could last well into next year.
The culprit for the itchy, oozy rashes is the microscopic hairs left behind by the browntail moth caterpillars that hatched this spring. They have since turned into moths, but their noxious hairs are still swirling through the midcoast and southern coastal Maine region, the only part of the country where the invasive species is found.
Winter web counts for browntail moths were high this year in some parts of Cumberland and Sagadahoc counties, and pockets of infestation also were reported in three other counties, according to the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. Browntail moths build their webs in oak and apple trees.
Charlene Donahue, a forest entomologist with the Maine Forest Service, said the number of browntail moths might be the largest in the state in the past 10 years. A dry spring might have contributed to the large population because a fungus that kills the invasive species did not take hold. That means there are more adults laying more eggs, she said.
"The concern is we're going to have a lot more browntail moths next spring," Donahue said. "I would prepare for a bad year next year."
Browntail moth caterpillar hairs can cause a blistery, oozy rash or respiratory distress for people who come into contact with them.
Web surveys conducted by the Maine Forest Service found extremely high levels of overwintering in the tops of oak trees. Those counts were highest in Bowdoinham, Bath, Topsham, West Bath, Brunswick, Freeport and Harpswell.
Browntail moth webs also showed up in more southerly locations, including Cape Elizabeth, Scarborough, Westbrook, Windham, New Gloucester and Yarmouth.
Pockets of infestation were found in the Kennebec County communities of Augusta, China, Vassalboro and Waterville; Lewiston and Turner in Androscoggin County; and Whitefield in Lincoln County. An infestation was found this year at Gardiner High School.
Browntail moth caterpillar hairs break off the caterpillar and circulate in the air. The dried skin the caterpillars release when molting also contains the hairs and can cause irritation for people.
"It's just really unpleasant," Donahue said.
Donahue said those hairs are problematic because they have fishhooks that stick into the skin and contain an irritating chemical that does not break down for years.
"If you're mowing any time this summer or you're raking leaves this fall, you can get a rash," she said. "You could get rash next year."
The invasive browntail moth arrived in the United States in the 1880s in a shipment of roses from Europe. They spread through Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Nova Scotia before the population collapsed, according to the Agriculture Department. It is now found in North America only on the coast of Maine.
A 1904 report written by the University of Maine's Edith Patch described the elaborate -- if somewhat unusual -- lengths the City Improvement Society of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, went to get rid of moths the previous winter. The society gave $50 to the superintendent of schools, who paid children 5 cents a dozen for winter nests. Hundreds of nests were collected by the children and burned in the school furnace.
"In March, groups of Portsmouth newsboys were to be seen scanning the branches overhead and darting off eagerly for browntail nests," Patch wrote. "About the same time a Kittery urchin was heard to remark somewhat wistfully, 'The Portsmouth kids are makin' their fortune pickin' brown-tails.'"
In the 1980s, an infestation of browntail moths took hold on Casco Bay's islands, then spread to the mainland. Islands -- and later towns on the mainland -- used crop dusters to spray pesticides, but that practice was met with resistance from people concerned about the harm it could cause to lobsters and other shellfish.
Jackie Sartoris, of Brunswick, knows all too well the aggravation and irritation that comes along with browntail moths. She first saw browntail caterpillars about a decade ago when, all of a sudden, the side of her house was covered with them. She grabbed her vacuum and sucked them up, then later made the mistake of touching the vacuum bag. She soon found herself covered in a rash.
"I was lucky it just got on my arms and chest, because if you inhale (the hair) it can be much more serious," she said. "The itching is enough to drive you crazy. If you do scratch it, it gets worse."
Most people who come in contact with the toxins develop a rash that will last for a few hours to several days. A smaller number may be more sensitive to the toxins and get a severe rash that lasts for several weeks. One health survey has found that the toxins can cause respiratory distress in 11 percent of the population, according to the state Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
Sartoris said her husband, Steve Walker, a wildlife biologist, is attentive to their property and removes browntail moth nests from their trees every year.
"That's really critical," Sartois said, adding that they no longer have problems with the moths on their property.
Browntail moth infestations can be difficult to deal with because of restrictions on using pesticides in certain coastal areas. Also, because the moths are isolated to a small section of Maine, there is no funding for research into how to control the problem better, Donahue said.
Donahue recommends that people check their oak and apple trees for moth webs in the fall. They should clip out any webs they can reach, then burn them or submerge them in water. If the webs are too high to reach, a licensed pesticide applicator can treat them in the spring, she said.
In the meantime, Donahue suggests people who live in the areas affected by the moths take extra precautions to protect themselves, especially during dry weather when the microscopic hairs are more likely to be circulating.
People can protect themselves by wearing long pants and sleeves when they mow their laws -- or mow when the grass is wet -- and by avoiding sitting under apple and oak trees that show damage from the moths.
"There aren't a lot of options for people," Donahue said. "It's a really tough problem."
The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry has more information about browntail moths on its website, along with a list of licensed pesticide applicators willing to treat browntail infestations.

Abstract: Share Our Strength, based in Washington, D.C., organizes Taste of the Nation events around the country to raise money for its hunger programs, including education and helping children get better access to school and other food programs. Because of the cancellation, chefs who were bringing food to the event took some losses.

Full text:   Items to be auctioned under a tent at Fort Williams Park in Cape Elizabeth on Sunday will instead be auctioned online this week.
Maine anti-hunger programs that count on funding from the Taste of the Nation culinary fundraiser won't get as much this year as they normally do, after pouring rain and howling winds washed out the outdoor event Sunday.
But organizers said Monday that the cancellation won't result in a total financial loss for the local nonprofits.
Many of the items donated by chefs and food businesses to be auctioned under a tent at Fort Williams Park in Cape Elizabeth on Sunday will instead be auctioned this week online, through Friday. The event usually raises between $150,000 and $200,000 for the national Share Our Strength hunger program and for four local hunger prevention programs.
Ticket sales were low last week, when the storm was predicted. Even if an online auction and advance ticket sales add up to half of what the event normally raises, the groups involved could see a significant decrease in needed funding.
At Portland's Preble Street Teen Center, the event typically has raised $11,000 to $19,000 for meals, said Elena Schmidt, chief development officer for Preble Street. The total budget for the teen center's soup kitchen is about $97,000, she said.
At Good Shepherd Food-Bank, an Auburn-based group that collects food and distributes it to food pantries all over the state, the event typically has provided $20,000 to $30,000 for the Cooking Matters nutrition and cooking education program for low-income families, said Clara Whitney, communications manager for the food bank. The program's budget is $140,000.
"We're hopeful (Share Our Strength) can still raise funds this year through the auction and other events. We know we'll still get some money, just a smaller amount this year," said Whitney. "But we nonprofits are used to that. We know, often, we have to go out and find other ways to raise the money."
The other local groups slated to benefit from the Taste of the Nation event in Maine this year are Cultivating Community, whose programs include farmer training and gardening education, and The Opportunity Alliance, a family advocacy group.
On Monday, more than 40 items were listed as part of the Taste of the Nation Maine online auction. One was a four-course meal for 12, with wine pairings, provided in the bidder's home from Rosemont Market Bakery, with a value of $3,000. Another was a six-course tasting dinner for 10 people at Zapoteca in Portland, valued at $1,500. The auction is online at 32auctions.com/totnmaine.
Plus, about 175 Taste of the Nation tickets, priced at $100 to $150, were sold beforehand, said Emily Ryan, who coordinates Taste of the Nation fundraisers in New England for Share Our Strength. Ryan said some 400 people were expected at the event, but advance ticket sales were slowed because Sunday's storm was predicted by weather forecasters many days in advance.
Ryan said Share Our Strength may try to do other events this year in Maine to make up for the money that would have gone to its local partners. She also said the organizers, which include the national group and local volunteers, may consider having an indoor Taste of the Nation next year, or prepare an indoor back-up plan.
"It was definitely a hit for us. The live auction (at the event) is usually very robust, and it will be hard to make up those funds," said Ryan, who is based in Boston. "We will still give grants (to local groups) but less. We'll try to figure out other fundraising we can do to make up that money. We haven't regrouped yet, but we'll figure it out."
Share Our Strength, based in Washington, D.C., organizes Taste of the Nation events around the country to raise money for its hunger programs, including education and helping children get better access to school and other food programs. The group has been organizing an event in Greater Portland for at least nine years, Ryan said.
During that time, she and local organizers could not remember another one canceled. They said it rained very hard during an event in Freeport a couple of years ago, but without the heavy winds that blew Sunday. That event continued, and the rain eventually stopped.
Because of the cancellation, chefs who were bringing food to the event took some losses. But those contacted Monday said they didn't mind, noting no one can control the weather and they were glad their auction items would still be used.
Zapoteca in Portland had prepared 400 oysters for the event, and ended up giving many of them away at the restaurant Sunday night, said co-owner Tom Bard. Walter's in Portland had prepped ingredients for a fried green tomato dish, which chef and owner Jeff Buerhaus said he'll use at his restaurant this week.
"It's all for a great cause," said Buerhaus. "I'm glad to be a part of it."

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS) have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it in their own personal style.
The new owners of the Village Inn and Tavern in Belgrade Lakes are vivacious, ambitious and eager to please their customers. Throughout our dinner there, they were both all over the dining room, visiting with customers and assisting the staff.
Kate Beals and Heather Pena are determined to improve on what was already a good restaurant. They have renovated the upstairs dining room and downstairs tavern, brought in two experienced chefs, Dave Jordan and Sam Nutting, and added outstanding items to the menu that was already famous for its duck dishes.
But that's just the start of their ambitious plans which include Sunday brunch and outside dining this summer, when they'll expand to seven days a week. They've bought custom picnic tables, made by Mainely Woodcrafts, with umbrellas. I wouldn't wait for those though, because this place is likely to be packed this summer.
Rene, our server, worked at a Portland restaurant before starting at the Village Inn five years ago. Her experience and advice really made our meal special. For starters, she talked me into a wine I'd never had, a pinot noir from Monterey, California. It paired very well with my duck. The inn offers a good selection of wine and Maine microbrews, including Belgrade Lakes Pale Ale, brewed for them by Shipyard Brewing Co.
I will be forever grateful to Rene for recommending the Oysters Rock ($11) -- Maine Spinney Creek oysters, spinach, bacon, butter and breadcrumbs. She said some guests have a glass of wine and two orders of these for dinner. I can believe it. The three oysters were tart and tasty, with a bit of crunch. The bacon added saltiness.
A creature of habit, I wanted to see if the new chefs could match the delicious duck that made the Village Inn famous, so I ordered the 12-Hour Roast Duck with whipped potatoes and roasted vegetables. You get a choice of one half ($26) or one quarter ($18) duck. I had the half, but a quarter would have been plenty. There are lots choices of sauces, and I recommend the Madagascar.
Halfway through the duck, I discovered stuffing. "It's your lucky day," exclaimed Linda. And she was right. That's when she asked me how I was going to describe the sauce. "I like it," is about all I could come up with. "Where does it hit you in the mouth," she asked? When I explained, she told me the sauce was acidy, spicy and included chilies. Good to know!
A lady at the next table told her server, "That was the best duck I've ever had." Me too!
Kate and Heather are the young and enthusiastic new owners who have come with new ideas to make The Village Inn even better. They want the place to be comfortable yet fun. Picture big, comfy chairs and couches, big-screen TV and table and bar seating at the tavern. The calming wall colors and new chairs and rugs show how busy the new owners have been this winter creating a lovely atmosphere in the big open dining room as well.
There's an array of soups, salads, table snacks and appetizers to begin your meal. Kate mentioned that the spring fennel and orange salad with avocado is pretty awesome. Since it had already sounded like an interesting combination to me, I ordered that as my starter. It was love at first bite. All my favorites were here in a fresh herb vinaigrette. The combination of textures, (creamy avocado to crunchy fennel) and flavors (anise of fennel and tart blood oranges) was superb!
George was drooling over the duck, so there was an unmentioned hint that I shouldn't order that as my entree. With a choice of everything from butternut squash ravioli to scallops to braised short ribs, the entree choice wasn't easy. I ended up ordering the Statler Chicken (a boneless breast of chicken with the small wing bone attached.) I still think the true test of a restaurant is if they can cook chicken well.
Well, the Village Inn certainly can. My roasted chicken was served with a garlic pan gravy, whipped potatoes and minted spring peas. Truthfully, when I saw the words "minted spring peas" I thought: anything to convince me spring really is here! But this was indeed spring on a plate. The chicken was nicely seasoned with crispy skin and great gravy. Add mashed potatoes and peas and I have my perfect comfort food. I would order it again in a heartbeat.
This is a relaxed setting where you don't feel rushed. Diners came and went, but we lingered. The dining room really is lovely. The view from the window-side tables is still great, and I always look forward to the peaceful stream meandering nearby.
It was the Meyer Lemon Tart that jumped out at us for dessert. The desserts are made right here. That flaky crust was so good, and the lemon custard had the perfect balance of sweet and tart. It was a light ending to our meal. Even lighter because we split the dessert, much to George's disappointment. You won't be disappointed if you dine here soon.

Full text:   It was a great night out in Portland. We were stunned by the presentation of "Papermaker" at Portland Stage, impressed with supper at Po' Boys & Pickles and very pleased with our room at the Best Western Merry Manor Inn.
We don't usually insist that you do something in this column, but please don't miss Monica Wood's extraordinary and powerful play, "Papermaker," at the Portland Stage through Thursday, May 14. Wood is a Mainer with four wonderful novels and her autobiography. "When We Were The Kennedys," about growing up in Rumford, is the best autobiography Linda and I ever read. And now, it turns out she is a great playwright, too.
"Papermaker" is about a strike at the paper mill in Abbott Falls (yes, could be Rumford, could be Jay) and the tension, hardship and anger -- on both sides -- is very real. But Wood has added a very touching human element, taking us inside the families of the mill owner and a striker, and bringing us to a surprising finish. It's a play and performance you will never forget.
The Merry Manor, in South Portland, is a Lafayette Hotel property so it was no surprise to find a friendly staff and high level of attention to the comfort of guests. What did surprise us was the huge size of the inn, which includes a spa, exercise room, pool, restaurant and more. Our Captain Lafayette's Suite included a double jacuzzi, massage chair, high ceilings with a chandelier, gas fireplace, executive desk and a huge and very comfortable bed. The convenient location on U.S. Route 1, with easy access to Interstate 295, makes this an ideal spot for a stay in the Portland/South Portland area.
As lovers of all-things "N'awlins," it was not surprising that we loved Po' Boys. The restaurant is unpretentious and inexpensive, out at the far northern end of Portland's Forest Avenue, with outside seating on the street-side deck in the summer. Chef Brian Gastin, a friendly and engaging guy who has been cooking here for five years, took us through the impressive menu, noted the most popular items and helped us with our order.
Our food was every bit as good as any we enjoyed in New Orleans -- even better in some regards. The Louisiana Gumbo ($6) was loaded with chicken, shrimp and andouille sausage. It was very spicy, making me thankful that I had a Shipyard Summer Ale to put out the fire in my mouth.
My blackened fish sandwich, made with Maine pollack, included a wonderful Cajun coleslaw, tomatoes and a red pepper mayo. I ordered the small ($8), and it was plenty of sandwich for me. It was also very good.
The fried pickles (just $4) is a dish that will bring me back here many times. Featuring those sour pickles we love from Morse's Sauerkraut in Waldoboro, with a thick crunchy corneal crust and accompanied by a red pepper dip, this dish is unique and addicting. From the large array of sandwiches including the pulled pork, the Creole sausage, and the debris po' boy -- a traditional New Orleans sandwich of slow-cooked roast beef and gravy -- to the golden fried oyster salad and Cajun fish nuggets, it's going to take a lot of visits to try everything of interest on their menu.
While we had no room for dessert, Brian sent us home with one of their "World Famous coconut macaroons" which you can buy in markets throughout the area, marketed as "Choomy Cookies." Of course, I had to get the cookie out while writing this column, in order to tell you that it is really good. Linda raced over to the desk to make sure she got her half!
During February break we were watching the Fox News morning show when I recognized somebody. In a cooking segment, chef Brian Gastin from Po' Boys & Pickles was cooking with his daughter, Mya, who is a student at Mount Vernon Elementary School where I teach. Mya was a natural on TV, as was her father. I knew we had to get to Po' Boys.
The restaurant's sandwich board boasts salads, their famous sandwiches, sides and baskets. As chef Brian was going over the most popular items my heart was sinking, because I'd already spotted my favorite, the muffaletta. And then he announced his favorite sandwich, the Muffaletta Po' Boy. When I think of New Orleans, I think of delicious muffalettas.
The secret to authentic po' boys has to be the bread, and theirs comes from Leidenheimer Baking Company in Louisana. Started in 1896, this is a bakery with staying power. A framed cartoon on the wall says, "Sink ya teeth into a piece of New Orleans cultcha -- a Leidenheimer Po' Boy."
I am so glad we tried the sweet potato fries as well -- they were hands down the best I have had. Thinly sliced sweet potatoes were nice and crispy (both sides were not greasy at all) and topped with sea salt. Any establishment with pickles in its name had better have great pickles. Those that come with all the sandwiches fit the bill.
My muffaletta was as good as I dreamed. That crusty bread held three kinds of meat, prolovone, lettuce, tomatoes and olive relish to deliver that classic taste. They've perfected the ratio of ingredients-to-bread perfectly. Brian told us that a lady from New Orleans always buys some of the housemade olive relish to take home for her husband. This was a classic muffaletta for sure, and I didn't leave a crumb.

Abstract: Employees are having a difficult time keeping up with the work at current staffing levels, said Albert, who was neutral on the bill. "Since 2011, the current staffing levels do not support the volume and complexity of the work," Albert said, noting that there's a backlog of 1,400 overdue inspections.

Full text:   The Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee on Monday heard testimony about whether to beef up the state's restaurant inspection program, which a state official says has a backlog of 1,400 overdue inspections.
The public hearing comes after the state last week announced that it would put restaurant inspections online, joining most states that already post reports online. Portland, which has its own restaurant inspection program, began posting food inspections online in 2013, after the Portland Press Herald reported on the lack of transparency and infrequency of restaurant inspections.
Since then, Portland has also increased the number of inspectors from one to 2.5 and added food safety training programs.
The bill to increase state inspectors by Rep. Janice Cooper, D-Yarmouth, does not indicate how many inspectors would be needed beyond the 11 currently employed by the state, but the goal is to have annual inspections rather than the current average of once every two years. The 11 inspectors also investigate summer camps, hotels, public pools and tattoo parlors.
Ken Albert, Maine Center for Disease Control director, testified that the state would need 20 more inspectors, which would cost an additional $2 million, to complete annual inspections. Employees are having a difficult time keeping up with the work at current staffing levels, said Albert, who was neutral on the bill.
"Since 2011, the current staffing levels do not support the volume and complexity of the work," Albert said, noting that there's a backlog of 1,400 overdue inspections.
The state currently inspects 5,700 facilities per year, he said. Unable to meet a previous state requirement to inspect establishments annually, the Legislature in 2011 voted to reduce the frequency of inspections from annually to every two years.
Greg Dugal, president and chief executive officer of the Maine Restaurant Association, told the Press Herald after Monday's hearing that he could see a potential compromise on the issue, rather than hiring 20 more inspectors.
Dugal said he doesn't object to having more inspections, especially for restaurants that handle food that's more tricky to prepare, such as shellfish.
"If you're a bed and breakfast and all you're making is quiche and scrambled eggs, there's not much risk and you probably don't need to be inspected every year," Dugal said.
But if more inspections are funded by licensing fee increases, that would be difficult for small business owners to afford.
Dugal said the increases could cause the fees, which typically range from $100 to $500 per year, to double. Dugal said additional inspections should be paid for out of the General Fund, rather than licensing fees. Typically, about 4 percent to 6 percent of restaurants fail their inspections, according to the state.

BENTON -- A tractor-trailer carrying 30,000 pounds of live lobsters from Nova Scotia overturned early Wednesday morning on Interstate 95 southbound during whiteout conditions, according to the driver and state police.
The driver, Horst Puff, 55, of Greenfield, Nova Scotia, and his dog, Banjo, 10, were not injured in the crash, which occurred around midnight Tuesday as Puff tried to avoid striking a vehicle that had spun out in front of him, both he and state police Trooper Joseph Chretien said at the scene later Wednesday.
"I'm OK," Puff said, as he stood on I-95, his back against the wind. "There were dry roads from Bangor down to here. Everything was OK."
He said then there was blowing snow, whiteout conditions and a car in front of him. "The car hit the brakes. I hit the brakes," he said. "I saw nothing and came too far left and tipped over and Banjo went on top of me. He was on my chest."
The car that was in front of the truck never stopped, and the driver's identity is not known, police said.
The truck came to rest in the median about two miles north of exit 133 and near the Fairfield town line. There it stayed all day Wednesday, before it was finally removed around 7 p.m. The truck had to be righted with a crane, and the difficulty as well as the strong wind that blew all day delayed the move. Both southbound lanes were briefly closed for the removal.
Puff was driving the 2007 International truck owned by Gerhardt Trucking of Nova Scotia, taking the lobsters to wholesalers in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Rhode Island.
The lobsters, in 300 crates that weighed about 100 pounds each, survived the wreck and were being taken out of state following inspection by a state agriculture official, Chretien said.
At 11:15 a.m., before the lobsters were removed from the trailer, Chretien sat in the closed lane of I-95 as 42 mph winds whipped across the area known as Benton Flats, blowing snow into the road. Employees of Boulet's Truck Service worked to clear snow from around the overturned truck.
The southbound passing lane was closed to traffic as police awaited a flatbed truck that would carry the 300 crates of lobsters to Boulet's on U.S. Route 201 in Fairfield, Chretien said.
"The gusts are incredible right now," Chretien said after calling Waterville's LaFleur Municipal Airport to ascertain the wind speed.
Chretien said he got a call about the crash at 12:05 a.m. and arrived around 12:15 a.m.
He and Puff also had trouble getting Banjo out of the truck's cab.
"We were not able to get him through the door so we had to knock the windshield out," Chretien said. "It's a nice dog -- a very nice dog. He is fine." Puff said he got Banjo, a husky-Australian shepherd mix, from the humane society.
Chretien took Puff and Banjo to the Comfort Inn in Waterville, where they spent the rest of the night. He brought Puff back to the crash scene later Wednesday morning.
Chretien said traffic was moving fairly smoothly later in the day, but motorists were stopping on I-95 to take pictures, causing a dangerous situation.
"That's what my main concern right now is," he said during the afternoon.
The southbound passing lane of I-95 was closed for most the day, according to Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
At mid-afternoon, McCausland reported Chretien deemed the cab and trailer were likely damaged beyond repair. No charges are expected to be filed against Puff, according to McCausland.
Officials with the state Department of Transportation arrived after the crash and helped close the lane off to traffic and placed a large truck in the lane to protect the area.
"The DOT has just been fabulous," Chretien said.
Meanwhile, Banjo was being cared for Wednesday at the Boulet office in Fairfield, where Chris Michaud, who runs the parts department, was feeding him and taking him outside for walks.
"He's my surrogate son for the day," Michaud said.
The friendly brown and black dog with one brown eye and one blue eye was tied to Michaud's desk leg with an orange rope, but had plenty of room to move around. As employees walked to and from the shop through Michaud's office, they patted the dog.
"When they start a truck in the shop, he whimpers," Michaud said. "He thinks that his daddy is starting his truck."
Brian and Paul Boulet, owners of the business, said they have taken dogs in before that have been in accidents.
Brian Boulet said Gerhardt's, which owns the Nova Scotia truck, brought another trailer to load the lobsters into from Boulet's.
Gerhardt Trucking officials couldn't be reached by phone Wednesday.
Before the lobsters were taken to safety, they were worried about them freezing, Brian Boulet said. "They have to be between 35 and 40 degrees to live. That's what we were told by Gerhardt's."

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it -- their favorite inns, restaurants, trips, activities, experiences, travel books and websites -- in their own personal style. They offer anecdotes, tips and the details you need. Join them in exploring the great state of Maine.
Linda and I think dining out should be fun, so we eagerly anticipated Taco 2's Day at Rockland's 3Crow restaurant. And fun it was.
Part of the fun was that our daughter Rebekah and son-in-law Patrick joined us. But the friendly staff, beautiful interior and tasty food made this a particularly memorable evening.
The owners, chef Josh Hixson and his wife, Tara Barker, are front and center here. Josh cooks New Orleans-inspired food, another thing that drew our attention to this relatively new restaurant on Rockland's Main Street. New Orleans food draws us often to our favorite Portland restaurant, Hot Suppa.
Given his focus on Southern cooking, you could imagine that Josh's tacos would be awesome -- and you would be right. Josh offers nine traditional and unique tacos. The tacos are small, so you can try a variety. Our table was covered in tacos when our server Brystle delivered them.
It would be hard to pick favorites, but I found the fish taco nice and spicy, and the steak taco unusual with feta cheese. But my favorite was the pork taco. Interestingly, we each had a different favorite. We all agreed that the smoky thin onion rings were exceptional.
Pat and I had a long discussion on the impressive offerings of beer, having a hard time making our choices. So I ordered a beer flight of three five-ounce servings with a light beer, a sweet beer and a stout. We both loved the Pemaquid Oyster Stout by Marshall Wharf in Belfast and ordered glasses of it.
Tara makes the desserts, and they are all gluten-free. And boy, are they delicious. The doughnut was just amazing. I sighed and said "ahhh," when Linda responded "You couldn't possibly have tasted that before you said 'ahh.' " But she was wrong. Or I may have been ahhing in anticipation of that treat, given that Lin would never ever allow me to have a doughnut for dinner.
The mousse got a "wow" from me, featuring two of my favorites: peanut butter and chocolate. While I did like the doughnut, the mousse was my favorite dessert.
3Crow is a family place, with Josh and Tara's two kids roaming around. Their kids have their own room downstairs and often have friends there. It is certainly a kid-friendly place. And it is a beautiful place. I especially loved the lighting and the water tank filled with plants on the wall beside us. There's a variety of seating, including a bar. The building was once a bank, and I peaked into the old vault where they now store their wine. Neat!
I first took note of 3Crow when John Golden, at that time the restaurant critic for the Maine Sunday Telegram, wrote a very favorable review. And now, having enjoyed Taco 2's Day, we hope to return for the regular menu, which is really intriguing. Justin and Tara also own 40 Paper, an Italian restaurant in Camden. And yes, that is now on our list for a visit, too.
Walking into the 3Crow restaurant for the first time, I was hit by the sheer beauty of the space. High tin ceilings make this space seem large. They are using the first floor for serving -- both the bar and all the seating is found here. The kitchen is actually downstairs, so the servers are in good shape given all the travel up and down those stairs.
Paintings, flowers and mirrors are carefully placed and the openness of the room gave me the feel of an art gallery, and a beautiful one at that. A Louisiana influence in the flavors here is because John spent a lot of time there. Tara's influence is on the sweet side of the menu, and she knows her way around delicious gluten-free desserts.
Lots of customers showed up for Taco 2's Day the night we visited. We began with a few appetizers and their addictive guacamole. "It's nice and limey," remarked Rebekah. I was drawn to the hush puppies -- crispy cornmeal cakes that came with a New Orleans remoulade.
Winner of the most unusual appetizer, and an absolute hit with all of us, was the Tobacco Onions. Thinly shaved onions are cold-smoked then fried to crispiness. The smokiness of the onions was a surprise and combined well with their housemade ketchup.
Lest you think tacos are boring, their offerings were very creative. We pondered over the choices of fish, pork carnitas, frijoles, steak, chorizo and Brussels sprouts. Lucky for us, Rebekah and Patrick were along, so we ordered two of each of them. The girls voted the Brussels sprouts with bacon as our favorite. So good.
I must say, unlike the rest of the Smiths, I am not a huge doughnut fan, but Tara's warm, freshly prepared gingerbread doughnuts were, hands down, the best I ever tasted. The doughnut holes came in a funnel-shaped serving dish with a side of white chocolate dipping sauce. I dare anyone to guess these were gluten-free. She explained the types of ingredients she uses to substitute for the wheat, and some of them were completely unfamiliar to me. I just know one thing -- that was an extraordinary dessert.
Visit George's website -- georgesmithmaine.com -- for book reviews, outdoor news and all Travelin' Maine(rs) columns, found listed in the "Best of Maine" section.
Our end-of-January weekend in Rockland was lots of fun, highlighted by a stay in a luxurious suite overlooking the ocean at the Samoset Inn, where the ice bar was a big draw. And the annual Pies on Parade fundraiser for the local Interfaith Outreach Food Pantry and Fuel Assistance Program was, well, very filling.
It was great to see so many readers of this column at Pies on Parade, which sold all of its 650 tickets. I did fall far short of my goal of getting to all 25 places serving sweet and savory pies. My brother, Gordon Smith, sister-in-law Janet Smith and friend Katharine Ayer joined us. We were able to get to only nine places before we were stuffed. And it took us two hours to do that, because we spent a lot of time visiting with the hosts and guests at each place.
Anticipating this problem, I had prepared a map and list of our favorite places not to be missed. For the record, here are the nine we got to: Berry Manor Inn, LimeRock Inn, Captain Lindsey House, Breakwater Vineyards, Fiore Olive Oils, Terra Optima, Rustica, Fog Bar & Cafe and the Lighthouse Museum. Alas, two favorite restaurants, Cafe Miranda and In Good Company, were unable to participate that day.
This year's event was record-setting, raising $25,695, and 11,000 pieces of pie were consumed -- not all by me, thankfully.
We drove down to the Samoset early on that Saturday, to avoid the approaching storm, and chose to stay there right through the blizzard -- thanks in part to a Maine Medical Association conference, led by Gordon. He invited us to their evening social hour, where the food was so good and plentiful that we didn't need to have dinner. I have got to say the food at the Samoset, even for large groups, is exceptional.
That Saturday they were hosting their first-ever family winter festival, with lots of indoor and outdoor activities including a sleigh ride. Unfortunately, the snow storm put a damper on that event.
But our grandsons, Addison and Vishal, arrived on Sunday morning to enjoy the outdoor ice rink and the indoor fun palace, a huge room where the Samoset has set up everything from ping pong to tumbling mats and structures.
A few weeks ago, someone told Linda she noticed we write about Rockland a lot. Yes indeed. Guilty as charged.

Full text:   for 'Oscars of the food world'
Ten Maine restaurants and food professionals, the highest number ever, were named semifinalists Wednesday for James Beard Awards.
Often called "the Oscars of the food world," the prestigious annual restaurant and chef awards cover 21 categories with 20 semifinalists in each chosen from more than 34,000 online entries.
The New York-based James Beard Foundation also bestows awards for food- and drink-related books, journalism, broadcast and new media, and restaurant design, although finalists in those categories won't be announced until next month. The restaurant and chef semifinalists will be whittled down to five finalists in each category and announced on March 24 at the James Beard House in New York City. The black-tie awards ceremony is scheduled for May 4 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago -- the first time that the event will be held outside New York.
Last year there were four semifinalists from Maine, but no finalists.
The 2015 Maine semifinalists:
[bullet] Central Provisions in Portland is a semifinalist for Best New Restaurant.
[bullet] Alison Pray, proprietor of Portland's Standard Baking Co., has been nominated in a new category for 2015, Outstanding Baker.
[bullet] Cara Stadler, the chef at Tao Yuan in Brunswick and Bao Bao in Portland, is a semifinalist for Rising Star Chef of the Year.
The annual awards also recognize excellence in beverage service.
[bullet] Andrew and Briana Volk changed Portland's drinking landscape when they opened their craft cocktail bar, Portland Hunt & Alpine Club, in September 2013. The Nordic-themed bar is a semifinalist for Outstanding Bar Program.
[bullet] Rob Tod, founder of Portland's Allagash Brewing Co., is nominated for Outstanding Wine, Beer or Spirits Professional.
[bullet] Portland's Fore Street makes a regular appearance on the annual awards list. This is the seventh year it has been nominated for Outstanding Restaurant.
This year, five Maine chefs are semifinalists for Best Chef, Northeast. This is the sixth nomination for Brian Hill, chef of Francine Bistro and Seabright in Camden, and Shepherd's Pie in Rockport. Another Camden chef, Ravin "Bas" Nakjaroen, of Long Grain, is a semifinalist for the second time, as is chef Masa Miyake, of Miyake and Pai Men Miyake, both in Portland.
Chefs Andrew Taylor and Mike Wiley, of Portland's Eventide Oyster Co. and Hugo's received a first-time nomination for the award as a duo.
In 2014, Eventide was named to both Bon Appetit's and Food & Wine's lists of America's top oyster bars.

Portland bar closing after a 62-year run

Abstract: The closure comes 10 months after the Portland City Council recommended against renewing its state liquor license based on the number of times police had been called to the area, including for a shooting outside the bar in January 2014. "There's plenty of yuppie bars," said Howard, who sipped on a can of PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon beer) while his wife drank a white Russian.

Full text:   The bar had run out of its popular Jell-O shots an hour earlier, when doorman Emerson Boxill was sweeping up broken glass on the floor and found a small plastic medicine cup filled with blue gelatin.
The lid on top was still sealed and that was enough for Chris Buerkle to pop it open, dig in with his pinky and lay claim to taking the last Jell-O shot Sangillo's Tavern ever served.
"Desperate times call for desperate measures," said his friend, Joe Watts.
After 62 years in operation and three generations of owners, the beloved neighborhood bar rang the brass bell mounted on the wall for its final "last call" just before 1 a.m. Sunday.
The jukebox, strong drinks, friendly people - and the alcohol-laced Jell-O cups - were hailed by the wall-to-wall crowd in the tiny wood-paneled bar tucked away on Hampshire Street in Portland.
The closure comes 10 months after the Portland City Council recommended against renewing its state liquor license based on the number of times police had been called to the area, including for a shooting outside the bar in January 2014.
The state's liquor board upheld the city's decision last month and the bar's owner decided not to appeal, meaning it would have to close in 30 days.
The time came early Sunday morning.
The Hampshire Street bar had been busy all week as the end approached, and it was busy as soon as it opened for the last time Saturday morning, said third-generation owner Dana Sangillo.
They came from all corners of the bar's eclectic clientele, which includes retirement-age regulars from the neighborhood, lobstermen coming off the ocean in the morning and servers who had just finished their work shifts at trendy restaurants nearby.
Some parked themselves at bar stools, savoring the final hours. Others came in for a drink or two to commemorate the closing.
Ashlee McLaughlin, 28, of Brunswick, said Sangillo's is usually where she ends a night of drinking in the Old Port. On Saturday, it was her first stop.
"Maybe it will be the last," she said.
McLaughlin said she likes the small bar because "it lacks a lot of the pretension that other bars have."
John Howard, 65, of South Portland agreed.
He and his wife had to cut their weekend in Bethel short because of the snowstorm, but he was glad it gave him the chance to visit the bar he's enjoyed over the years one more time. They kept their coats zipped up, sitting at a small counter by the door.
"There's plenty of yuppie bars," said Howard, who sipped on a can of PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon beer) while his wife drank a white Russian.
"I can go have a martini somewhere else," he said.
One of those places might be Eventide Oyster Co., a seafood and cocktails hot spot across the street - and the workplace of some of the most devoted Sangillo's customers.
Eventide owner Arlin Smith said Sangillo's has been more than a bar where cooks and servers go after work. It's where they have birthday parties, hatch out business plans and say goodbye to parting employees.
"We cherish this. This is our safe haven," he said. "I don't know what we're going to do."
Jeff Crane, 51, who lives in the neighborhood, has also been at a loss. He comes into Sangillo's three times a week for rum and cokes.
"It's almost the only bar in Portland that's just a bar," he said.
It's not about watching sports or eating food here - unless, he said, "you count the Hot Pockets," an offering from the sparse snack menu.
"This is part of the community," said Crane.
As the end of the night approached, there was barely room to squeeze through the crowd to get to the bathroom or the bar. Two young women found extra space by standing on a bench that had been holding coats. They danced and chanted, "One more night."
Throughout the evening, glasses were raised and cellphones captured selfies to document the end of an era. The jukebox blasted everything from high-energy pop to sentimental country songs.
The hugs and tears didn't come until after last call.
For Mark Lee, the night was all about his mother, Andrea, a Sangillo's bartender for 37 years who died in November.
"If she was alive today, it would have killed her," he said about seeing the place close. "It was basically her life."
Dana Sangillo, the third generation owner, didn't know what to say, other than to offer his thanks for the support he's gotten.
"You see how much this means to so many people. It's humbling," he said.
Bartender Janessa Emmerton handed two handfuls of beer bottles to a customer over the bar when the clock struck 1 a.m.
She looked out to the crowd and swiped her hand across her neck.
"Done and done," she said.

Full text:   You may be able to hear them howling from the Capitol today. It's Dog Day at the Maine Legislature.
No, dogs are not allowed in the Capitol building. But the place will be full of dog lovers attending a public hearing on a bill to name the Labrador retriever our state dog. The bill is sponsored Sen. David Dutremble, D-Biddeford, at the request of a constituent, Stacy Gile of Wells.
"I certainly don't blame people for thinking, 'What do we need a state dog for?' Well, why don't we have one? We have all kinds of state symbols," Gile told Samantha Edwards of WLBZ TV. "We have the ones we all know about. We have the chickadee. We have the moose. We have the Maine coon cat. The cat gets their day, why can't the dog have theirs?"
This reminds me of my all-time-favorite legislative public hearing, on a bill sponsored by Sen. Paul Davis, R-Sangerville, to make the whoopie pie our state dessert.
The queen of whoopies, Amy Bouchard of Gardiner, creator of Isomax Wicked Whoopies, came up with the idea and filled the hearing room with whoopie pies. Certainly was the tastiest hearing ever.
Just like Dutremble with his dog bill, Davis was roundly criticized for "wasting the Legislature's time." Beth Quimby's Feb. 2 story in this newspaper quoted a woman from Arundel who said the Labrador bill "is stupid. There are so many other issues."
That woman misunderstands the legislative process. There is a lot of down time at the Legislature, for one thing, so legislators have plenty of opportunity for fun bills like this one. And the public gets most engaged in issues like this. We'll never fully understand tax reform bills, but boy, we can fire up on dogs.
Whoopie pies provide an important lesson for Dutremble and Gile. Maine's blueberry industry vigorously opposed naming the whoopie pie the state dessert. Legislators managed a compromise, naming the blueberry pie our state dessert and the whoopie pie our state treat. Brilliant. Now you have a good excuse to indulge in both.
And there is an economic benefit here. I don't know how many blueberry pies have been sold, but Bouchard has sold more than 30 million of her decadent and delicious Wicked Whoopies. That's not a typo -- 30 million.
Of course, there are more dogs than desserts in the running for state designation, so Giles will draw a whole lot of opposition. Support is growing for the Irish setter, the bull terrier, the Newfoundland, and even the bowser (part basenji, an African hunting breed, and Mexican chihuahua). Quimby reported that Andrew Parker of South Portland suggested a rescue dog, to "show how kind-hearted Mainers are."
If Parker attends the public hearing on the dog bill, kind-heartedness may not be in evidence. It is sure to be a howling good debate, but in my experience, nothing stirs up people like arguments about pets.
I can help Gile with one argument being made against her bill -- that the Lab has no strong connection to the state. Well, Moxie is our state drink, and it is produced in South Carolina.
In 2011, during the wicked good whoopie debate, I wrote a column proposing other state designations including the state sport (complaining) and the state liquor store (Portsmouth). And can you believe our state shellfish is not the lobster? OK, I'm complaining.
I proposed Stephen King as our state author. I sat next to Steve in freshman creative writing class at the University of Maine. At my book talks, I like to say we both became writers, and we've sold 300 million books.
If you insist that state designations should be created here, let's go with these. State mustard: Raye's, still made with the old grindstone in Eastport. State flour: Maine Grains from the Somerset Grist Mill.
State boot: I'll bet I don't have to tell you what this is, especially if you tried to buy a pair of L.L. Bean boots for Christmas and were told you couldn't get a pair until April.
And wouldn't it be fun to launch a discussion (OK, an argument) about a state vegetable? Are goose tongue greens a vegetable? They would be my choice. I am certain the fiddlehead folks will disagree. Tomatoes, anyone?
Alabama has a state nut. Now wouldn't that debate be interesting.
Finally, let's designate our state's favorite fun activity. I am pretty sure it will not be debating issues before the Legislature. Woof! Woof! Woof!

Full text:   A bill that would ban soaps, shampoos and other consumer products containing tiny plastic "microbeads" in Maine sailed through a legislative committee Wednesday after manufacturers and environmentalists made a rare alignment behind the measure.
Maine is one of roughly two dozen states where lawmakers are considering banning microbeads in personal care products, responding to concerns that the minuscule plastic pellets accumulate in lakes, rivers and oceans after passing through wastewater treatment filters. The synthetic microbeads pick up potentially toxic contaminants along the way before entering the food chain.
"There is too much at stake for us in Maine to wait for industry to decide this issue one company at a time, which is what is currently happening, and it is also very confusing for the entire retail industry," said Kathy Ramsdell, of the nonprofit organization Friends of Casco Bay. "Microbeads are clearly a threat to the health of the bay, and viable alternatives do exist."
Microbeads are plastic beads often measuring a fraction the size of a grain of sand that are marketed as exfoliants in hygiene products and cosmetics. Wastewater treatment plant operators say installing filters capable of capturing the tiny beads would be excessively costly and would necessitate increased maintenance.
The bill unanimously endorsed by the Legislature's Environment and Natural Resources Committee would prohibit manufacturers in Maine from using microbeads in personal care products -- such as body wash, toothpaste, facial scrubs and soap -- as of Dec. 31, 2017.
That is likely a small group, given the types of manufacturing done in Maine. But one year later, Maine stores would be prohibited from accepting for sale any personal care products containing microbeads.
The legislation defines synthetic plastic microbeads as "any intentionally added non-biodegradable solid plastic particle measuring less than 5 millimeters in size and used to exfoliate or cleanse in a product intended to be rinsed off."
Maine's legislation is modeled after bills that already have been signed into law in Illinois and New York. Many manufacturers already are removing or replacing synthetic microbeads with natural, biodegradable alternatives -- such as salt and flecks of crushed fruit pits or nuts -- in response to the environmental concerns and consumer demand.
The two leading industry trade groups representing manufacturers, the Personal Care Products Council and the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, testified in support of the bill on Wednesday.
Chris Jackson, a lobbyist representing both organizations, said federal legislation would be preferable to state-by-state laws but that consistency across states would help manufacturers and retailers.
"The Personal Care Products Council wanted to communicate that they are in support and they take questions and concerns around environmental impacts of their products extremely seriously," Jackson said. "In fact, many of their leading companies have already voluntarily begun the process of fading out the use of these microbeads."
The Retailers Association of Maine, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce and several environmental organizations also supported the bill.
Abigail Barrows, coastal monitoring coordinator with the Marine & Environmental Research Institute in Blue Hill, said microbeads and the other types of micro-plastics affect all levels of the food chain from zooplankton to large marine mammals.
Barrows' organization found "very high concentrations" of micro-plastics in some mussels and oysters collected in Maine and in water samples from Blue Hill and Penobscot bays, particularly near discharge sites of treated wastewater.
"Passage of L.D. 85 would go a long way to tackling the serious and growing pollution problem in the Gulf of Maine," Barrows said. "Why would we not want to immediately stop toxic plastics entering the food chain and ending up on our dinner plates?"
No one testified in opposition to the bill, prompting sponsor and committee chairman Sen. Tom Saviello, R-Wilton, to move to rush the bill through committee in a single day. Saviello said a unanimous committee vote also could help the bill win support of the full Legislature and pass muster with Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican who has opposed past efforts to ban products or product ingredients based on environmental concerns.
"It is a little bit unusual to have people on both sides of anything to agree with each other" in this committee, said Rep. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake, who has served more than 40 years in the Legislature, including a long stint as House speaker. "In this instance, it is one of those times where if you have unanimity, take it and run."

Full text:   In just a year, chef David Levi opened the avant-garde, 100 percent Maine-sourced Vinland, riding a wave of ups and downs that ended with Levi - visionary or kook or however he's perceived - headed to New York to cook dinner at the legendary James Beard House.
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the last of a four-part series on Vinland chef David Levi. Find the full series on centralmaine.com.
hree overhead cameras were trained on Vinland chef David Levi, streaming live footage of him cooking dinner at one of the most vaunted culinaryaddresses in America, the James Beard House at 167 West 12th St. in Manhattan. Just off camera, someone informed him of the final head count for dinner. "57?" Levi asked, leaning forward, his tone polite, inquisitive. If he were nervous, the only sign of it was in the way he smoothed down an already smooth kitchen towel at his hip before going back to the dinner he was preparing for those 57 people.
All businesses are ruled by numbers, but nowhere are they quite as naked as in a chef's world, where the number of people being served on any given night counts as validation, stagnation or an outright rebuke. Capacity at the Beard House is 80. Izabela Wojcik, the director of house programming for the James Beard Foundation, said 50 is an average number of diners, who pay between $130 and $170 to taste the food of notable chefs from around the country (and the world).
This then was a good turnout, solid while not earth shattering. But for Levi, merely being asked to cook at the Beard House, the former residence of the famed cookbook author and teacher - a sort of Carnegie Hall for chefs as the foundation often describes itself- was huge, especially in his first year of business. "I'm honored," he'd said the week before. "Grateful."
There are other numbers worth talking about. Number of restaurants Levi ran before Vinland: 0. Number of years Vinland has been in operation on Congress Street in Portland: 1. The percentage of his food on his "Winter's Expression of Maine" dinner for the Beard House (including charred beets, monkfish cheeks, lobster with fried nori) that was from Maine: 100. How long it took him and his staff, including sous chef Kate Whittemore, to trudge through the snow and wedge all that food - the Maine food had to come from Maine after all - into his Jetta station wagon for the 323-mile drive to Manhattan: two hours.
Finally there's the number of times out of 26 pay periods in 2014 that Levi felt able to cut himself a check. That corresponds to the number of cameras trained on him that Tuesday evening in New York: 3.
There has to be, Wojcik said, some "alchemy at play" that allows a chef to be considered to cook at the Beard House. It's uncommon but not unheard of for a chef in his or her first year of business to be invited. "I kept hearing about David," Wojcik said. Then Christopher Papagni weighed in last fall. The former executive vice president at the International Culinary Center (formerly the French Culinary Institute in New York City) relocated to Portland not long after Levi, a native New Yorker. Papagni had been eating at Vinland since it opened and was captivated. "He was the last person to remind me that this name was kicking around in my brain," Wojcik added.
Levi said the foundation offered him dates in January through March, but worried whether he could pull it off when nearly everything in Maine, even the bays, tend to freeze. He relished the challenge. "If we're going to showcase what Maine cuisine is all about, it is much more compelling to do it in the winter than the summer," he said. "In the summer, we have many of the same things that you'd find in any part of the country." In the winter, Maine's famed resiliency materializes in its foods, and he was eager to put any concerns to rest.
She sees Levi's Vinland as a genuine signifier of Portland's place in the food world, which is not inconsiderable. "Now we have to say Portland, Maine," Wojcik said. "You can't assume you're talking about Portland, Oregon anymore." And she added, "The thing about David and Vinland is, it puts an ambitious, modern, interesting and intellectual restaurant in your midst in Portland. And you kind of need one if you are going to claim to have a real food scene."
Arriving at Vinland five days before the James Beard House dinner, you'd have found Levi making himself a late breakfast of sunny side up eggs, goat cheese, saukerkraut and warm tortillas, which he generously shared. The night before, in honor of the restaurant's one-year anniversary, Vinland had treated its suppliers, from farmers to foragers, to dinner. Levi went table by table, pointing out where everyone had sat.
"We decided we were going to celebrate our anniversary by making no money," he said with a big smile.
Speaking of money, while skeptics in the Portland restaurant community might be surprised that Vinland is still open - the same people who thought Levi was crazy for removing non-native ingredients like olive oil, pepper, lemon and chocolate from its flavor arsenal - he is not. He said Vinland turned a profit in its first year, most of which went to paying back investors, though he did not share details of the finances. He's proud of how the restaurant has kept its costs down with the help of minimal investors (the largest investors gave $10,000 "of which there were only a few") and an opening budget of less than $250,000, while maintaining quality. He indicated the locally made furniture - clean, modern lines, blond wood. "These stools were expensive. But I couldn't open a restaurant where we would be buying stuff made with slave wages."
Monetarily, he's in "kind of the predictable place of being a new business owner in a bootstrap business." He waves off his own lack of pay. Asked when was the last time he got, say, a new coat, he pointed to the shearling coat his girlfriend Liz Trice gave him for Christmas. Secondhand at Material Objects. But what about the electricity bill? "I'm not sure I want to get into too many details," he added. "I've just taken a vow of temporary poverty."
Levi believes that is only temporary, because he is full of ideas of how to build the business. Most immediately, he'd make better use of outdoor seating in the warmer months. He mused about a complementary side business featuring something less labor intensive yet still 100 percent local. Piccolo has Blue Rooster, Hugo's has Eventide - maybe Vinland could have its own little brother or sister.
Then there's getting more customers in the door. Levi, whose sincerity is matched only by his savvy, is also aware that the James Beard honor pays dividends in resumé and reputation building.
January was a perfect month for Levi to take on a James Beard House dinner. "We were not only willing but happy to take a midweek night in January," Levi said. "For us it is ideal." Business is slow, as it is for virtually all Maine restaurants in winter. He could close the restaurant and not miss much.
But an invitation to the Beard House is an honor that costs chefs money. The Beard House hosts about 220 dinners a year, and Wojcik said the chefs who take part spend anywhere from $7,500 to $30,000, between transportation, food costs (she has a "modest" budget to help offset those) and hotel. Levi is used to cutting corners where he can. They'd drive, not fly, and instead of hotels, he and his crew could stay with his parents.
On that Friday before the dinner, Levi and Whittemore were plotting the prep work they'd need to do. The menu had been set for weeks. He'd be picking up the lobster - donated by Maine Lobster Direct - the next day and on the Sunday before, they'd process them. Brooklyn-based Zev Rovine Selections would be donating all the wine, Allison Lakin of Lakin's Gorges in Rockport the hard cheeses for the cheese course. Harbor Fish in Portland was giving them the monkfish. But when and how to cook it on unfamilar equipment - gas ovens, not induction - down in New York?
"I wonder if we should butter poach it?" Whittemore offered. Levi suggested a good sear and holding the fish in butter.
He said he was a little nervous. "I'm not nervous," Whittemore said. "The best way to approach this kind of thing is to think of it as another night that demands our highest performance, which is every night."
They joked about the cameras that would be watching them at the Beard House. Whittemore, who has been with Levi since the beginning, along with bartender Alex Winthrop (her partner in life and fine dining), tends to stay away from the limelight. "I'll sous-vide the cameras," Whittemore joked, referring to a method of cooking things almost agonizingly slowly.
TAKE A BOW
As the first guests began arriving on Tuesday evening, Levi was putting the finishing touches on what the Beard House classifies as hors d'ouevres but which he'd told the wait staff he preferred to call "snacks." ("We don't call them hors d'ouevres," he said. "We're not a French restaurant.") Up walked Maralyn Salvas, a native of Biddeford who has lived in Connecticut for more than 40 years and who, along with her
husband, Jeff Goldwasser, has been a member of the James Beard House for nearly as long as the foundation has existed (it opened in 1986, the year after James Beard died; they joined in 1990). The Salvas-Goldwassers had been up to Maine over New Year's and ate at Vinland on New Year's Day. (No one can say Levi doesn't work hard; he stays open when almost everyone is closed). They're foodies. When they come to Maine they seek out the new and fashionable, but as Goldwasser ut it, "Don't get me wrong, every trip we go to J's Oysters."
Salvas asked if Levi remembered her. He did. "We were talking about Italy," Levi said as his fingers busily worked over an appetizer of raw beef with cranberries, horseradish, pickled shallots and micro cress.
Goldwasser joined his wife and told Levi that he'd canceled a business trip to Los Angeles which would have had him away on the night of the Beard House dinner; that's how eager he was to eat Levi's food again. "Are you having fun?" he asked Levi, who had already been asked that question a number of times that evening. "It's an honor," Levi answered.
The morning after the dinner, Goldwasser said those charred beets were so good, "I was eating it with my fingers." He attends 10 to 12 dinners a year at the Beard House, which puts him in the frequent diner category (and is more than 250 dinners total). The Vinland dinner "was way up there," he said. "What we really loved is the idea that it is all sustainable and all from Maine. It's simple but very complex as far as the flavors."
Shelley Menaged, special projects manager for the Beard House, declared the dinner "lovely." "And I enjoyed everything I ate tremendously."
Her companions said they'd never had better-tasting turnips than the ones in Levi's soup, and puzzled over the source of the bright, appealing acid taste since they knew it wasn't from citrus (answer: Levi uses yogurt whey to poach the turnips and adds strained yogurt to the soup before it's served).
The all-local aspect was striking, Menaged said. But with it came a certain hard-to-define eating experience, particularly around some of the unusual accompaniments. "The very tasty pork dish could have used some mustard," she said. A fig jam to go with the very tasty cheese would also have been nice. The lack of these things "didn't make the food taste any less," she said. "But it was a definite, conscious lack of something."
She paused, thought about it and said, "I'm going to say it is conscious-effort eating," she said. "But if I was up in Maine, would I go back to the restaurant? In a heartbeat, yes."

Full text:   If one of your New Year's resolutions is to eat shellfish at Cook's Lobster House, better get cracking.
The iconic Maine seafood restaurant in Harpswell closes for the season today, and while the restaurant promises to open again in spring for its 60th year, the business is being sold.
The restaurant and real estate are on the market for $1.79 million, according to the website of Malone Commercial Brokers in Portland. The sale includes a 5,320-square-foot, single-story wood frame building on 1.37 acres, the listing says. The restaurant seats 190 people and includes a large commercial kitchen, two dining rooms, a bar and lounge, a gift shop and outside deck that seats an additional 50. The decor is decidedly Maine-centric: knotty pine, lobster traps and lots of nautical memorabilia.
And then there are those views. Generations of Mainers have journeyed down the peninsula and over the historic cribstone bridge to feast on lobster while enjoying views of Merriconeag Sound and Garrison Cove, and of lobstermen bringing in their daily catch.
For at least the past three years, the restaurant's fans have included Jackie and Terry Tiner, of Belgrade, who make an annual pilgrimage to Cook's celebrate their wedding anniversary. They always order the Point Shore Dinner, which includes a lobster, steamers, corn on the cob and potato. If anything changes, Jackie Tiner said, they would miss it.
"It's my favorite place to go," she said. "You're right there on the ocean, and I love the ambience."
Cook's Lobster House has had only two owners since 1955. The current owner, Curt Parent, started working there as a dishwasher when he was in high school in the late 1970s. After graduation, he became a full-time employee and nine years later purchased the restaurant. Parent did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the sale.
Managing a long-running restaurant such as Cook's can be a challenge, the culinary equivalent of running a marathon, says Greg Dugal, president of the Maine Restaurant Association, which gave Parent a lifetime achievement award in 2012. It's exhausting, and there are a lot of expectations from generations of devoted fans that management won't drop the ball
"With iconic properties like that, all you can be is the steward of that property while you own it and try to make it better and more appealing for the next owner, the next generation of visitors," Dugal said. "I think, really, that is what Curt has done with the property. When we recognized him in 2012, we were certainly recognizing him, but we were also recognizing the iconic nature of the restaurant itself."
In 1997, Cook's was one of only seven businesses in the nation to be featured in a commercial for Visa, which attracted even more visitors to its out-of-the-way location.
Cook's employs about 100 people during a typical year. It's known for sponsoring fishing tournaments and an annual July Fourth fireworks display, and as a venue for weddings and lobster bakes. Nature cruises and charter boats sail right from its dock, and every day Casco Bay Lines stops there to drop off passengers to eat lunch at the restaurant or picnic. The restaurant's wharf operation, which includes 850 feet of dockage and utility sheds, is not part of the deal.
According to the property summary on the broker's website, if the wharf is ever sold, Casco Bay Lines will retain the right of way to continue to provide ferry service. The real estate agent declined to comment last week.
If Cook's sells, will it continue to be a restaurant?
"That's what it's designed to be, obviously," Dugal said. "In that area there are some lodgings already, so there's a need for places for people to go. I kind of struggle with what else it could be."
Dugal, who grew up in Brunswick, has his own fond memories of eating at Cook's with his family.
"My mother had limited mobility and it was a place she could get into," he recalled. "We were able to go down there and spend the afternoon looking out over the water and have a good old-fashioned lobster feed."
Despite the hard work involved in running a seasonal restaurant on Maine's coast, Dugal said places such as Cook's appear to be flourishing up and down the coast, thanks to tourists' taste for lobster. Many of them are still owned by the families who founded them.
"These places are still out there, and still doing well," he said.

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- Maine should increase research and monitoring into how rising acidity levels in oceans could harm the state's valuable commercial fisheries while taking additional steps to reduce local pollution that can affect water chemistry.
Those are two major recommendations of a state commission charged with assessing the potential effects of ocean acidification on lobster, clams and other shellfish. The Legislature created the commission this year in response to concerns that, as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have risen, the oceans have become 30 percent more acidic because oceans absorb the gas.
Researchers fear that organisms which form shells -- everything from Maine's iconic lobster to shrimp and the tiny plankton that are key links in the food chain -- could find it more difficult to produce calcium carbonate in more acidic seawater. They worry that the acidification could intensify as carbon levels rise and the climate warms.
Although research on Maine-specific species is limited, the commission of scientists, fishermen, lawmakers and LePage administration officials said the findings are "already compelling" enough to warrant action at the state and local level.
"While scientific research on the effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems and individual organisms is still in its infancy, Maine's coastal communities need not wait for a global solution to address a locally exacerbated problem that is compromising their marine environment," according to an unofficial version of the report unanimously endorsed by commission members Monday.
The panel's report will be presented to the Legislature after Monday's final edits are incorporated. Those recommendations include:
[bullet] Work with the federal government, fishermen, environmental groups and trained citizens to actively monitor acidity changes in the water or sediments and organisms' response to those changes.
[bullet] Conduct more research across various species and age groups to get a better sense of how acidification is affecting the ecosystem.
[bullet] Identify ways to further reduce local and regional emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, and to reduce runoff of nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients that can contribute to acidification.
[bullet] Reduce the impact of acidification through natural methods, such as increasing the amount of photosynthesizing marine vegetation like eelgrass and kelp, promoting production of filter-feeding shellfish operations, and spreading pulverized shells in mudflats with high acidity.
[bullet] Create an ongoing ocean acidification council to monitor the situation, recommend additional steps and educate the public. This recommendation is the only concrete legislative proposal contained within the report.
Commission member Joe Payne of the nonprofit group Friends of Casco Bay said he is "absolutely" confident that acidification is affecting shellfish in the Portland area. In its own research, Friends of Casco Bay has shown a potential link between acidity levels and shellfish development as well as documented high acidity levels in mudflats that no longer support profitable clamming.
"I'm very positive about the outcome" of the commission, Payne said. "Now there is at least a road map for Maine and it deals with some things we can do locally. And that's what I'm excited about because you lose some people when you talk globally."
Bill Mook with Mook Sea Farm, an oyster aquaculture operation on the Damariscotta River in Walpole, said he has serious concerns about the impact of ocean acidification on Maine's shellfish industry. After serving on the panel, Mook said his next mission will be to fight to make sure ocean acidification research programs are fully funded at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
"What I hope people get out of this is we don't know what is coming at us," said Mook, one of three representatives of the commercial fishing industry on the panel. "The big take-home message is how woefully inadequate the information is."
Susie Arnold, a marine scientist with the Island Institute, said she hopes some Maine researchers will receive a share of soon-to-be-announced NOAA funding for ocean acidification projects so scientists can begin filling in the gaps about potential impacts on lobster or other Maine shellfish. But Arnold was also pleased that the commission report contains several proposals that could be pursued without regulations.
Rep. Mick Devin, the House chairman of the panel, said ocean acidification "is a real threat to Maine's marine environment and the thousands of jobs that rely on its health."
"Maine has too much at stake to simply wait on others to come up with a global solution. We must take steps at the state and local levels to protect our marine resources and our coastal economy," Devin, D-Newcastle, said in a statement.

Full text:   Shipyard Brewery's Export Ale is one of my favorite brews, and it was brewed first at Federal Jack's, in Kennebunk, in 1992. That history drew us to Federal Jack's Restaurant and Brew Pub for dinner in April 2013 and Linda and I loved it so much we returned the very next day for lunch.
So it wasn't a hard sell when I suggested that we host some of our kids and grandkids here during our August visit to Ram's Head Farm in nearby York. Joining us for lunch at Jack's were son Josh, daughter-in-law Kelly and new granddaughter Ada, along with daughter Rebekah and grandsons Addison and Vishal.
Josh brews his own tasty beer down in Bridgewater, Mass., and once wrote a popular beer blog. So I felt like we were bringing along a real beer expert!
They say that, for a business, location is critical, and you couldn't get a better location for a restaurant. Federal Jack's, on the second story above the brewery, sits along the Kennebunk River looking across to Kennebunkport. You can walk back and forth between the towns over the nearby bridge, with lots of shops on both sides of the river. Linda would want me to tell you that she purchased two items of clothing in one shop for just $15!
The view from the outside deck is stunning, which is why there was a 45-minute wait for a table there when we arrived. So we opted to sit inside where a large table was available. And actually, the views of the river from inside Jack's are just as good as those outside and the air conditioning made our visit more comfortable on this very hot summer day.
Normally you wouldn't find us on the southern Maine coast in the summer. Parking was tough and the places we visited were packed with "summer people" and tourists. We heard a lot of different languages being spoken. We were happy, of course, that they were all here. And we were even happier when our server, Neil, delivered ice-cold beers. The Goat Island Light was a table favorite.
I went with Old Thumper, another favorite brewed by Shipyard. But in the restaurant, explained Josh, you get a different Thumper than I've been drinking at home. After his elaborate explanation, I gathered that this Thumper was brewed and served the "way English brews are supposed to be." It was actually quite different than my usual Thumper. Josh says that Shipyard's stouts and bitters -- as well as many other Maine microbrews -- are English style beers. Made we want to visit England!
Because Linda is wicked busy right now with her 1st grade class, I agreed to write this column myself with a bit of guidance from her about the food. So forgive me if this seems to be all about beer! Here comes the food part.
For our first two meals here, last year, we tried Buffalo-style chicken wings, a Mediterranean sampler, beef and bean chili, a grilled antipasto sandwich (Linda, of course), a fabulous grilled crab and Havarti sandwich (me) and a black and blue burger, my favorite at all Shipyard and Sea Dog pubs. The creative menu surprised us.
For our August lunch, the array of food on the table was impressive. It was summer in Maine, and I still remembered that grilled crab and Havarti sandwich. So I had it again, as did Kelly. Served on sourdough bread, it was chock full of crabmeat and the Havarti added a lot of flavor. The coleslaw was excellent. too.
Rebekah said her Fish Tacos ($11.99) were great. The pan-blackened cod was wrapped in flour tortillas with house salsa, fresh avocado, cherry pepper-lime aioli and shredded lettuce. It was served with a side of black beans and rice. "I don't like tartar sauce," she told me, "but I like this."
Linda enjoyed a Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich ($12.99) with roasted red peppers, goat cheese, artichokes and greens on a Stirato roll. I got a couple of bites and loved it.
Josh went with the Tavern Steak and Cheese ($11.99) -- locally raised beef with American cheese and Thumpin' onions on a soft sub roll -- and said it was very good.
Addison and Vishal selected from an extensive kids' menu that offered everything from "Ants on a Log" to clam chowder, with lots of sandwiches ($5 to $10) and even butter pasta, which Vishal had with meatballs ("They know kids," said Linda). Addi had fish and chips, and I noticed that he put ketchup on his fish!
The variety of seating here is nice, as is the entertainment. While the adults enjoyed the river views, Vishal colored and Addi watched the Red Sox game.
Josh, Kelly and Ada live in Massachusetts. We took a ton of photos of Ada, imprinting our 4-month-old granddaughter with the Maine coast. Earlier in the summer, Josh and Kelly took Ada to our North Woods camp, so she got a great dose of Maine this year!
The bill for five adults and two children totaled just $118, parking was free and there was no charge for the amazing view. We love Federal Jack's! Especially in the fall, winter, and spring.

A few summers ago, we spent a couple of enjoyable afternoon hours at the Maine Brewers' Guild annual event. That year it was "Craft Beer Comes To Boothbay." The proceeds support the guild and its mission to promote the craft brewing industry in Maine.
Maine brewers have won an international reputation for their craft, and all of the of state's brewing-industry leaders were there, including Shipyard's Fred Forsley. Dan Kleban, guild president and co-owner of the Maine Beer Company, predicted, "It's going to be tough to find a better place to be on a July afternoon in Maine." Dan got that right!
Maine now boasts 50 breweries that produce more than 200 different brands, many of them exceptional. We've enjoyed stops along the Maine Beer Trail (www.mainebrewersguild.org). Free tastings are featured, and many sell their brews in take-home growlers which can be returned and refilled.
But what has really surprised us is that the food at our favorite brew pubs is so good and creative. Here's a rundown of our favorites. Some produce their own beer, and all of them offer a remarkable list of Maine brews.
[bullet] Liberal Cup, Hallowell: If someone wants to meet with me in the Augusta area, I insist on lunch at the Cup. I rarely divert from their Cubano sandwich, but everything here is really delicious. And of course, the brews are good, too -- my favorite being Alewife Ale. A couple of years ago, the Cup's owner, Geoff Houghton, opened the Run of the Mill Pub on Saco Island with the same great brews and food.
[bullet] King Eider's, Damariscotta: "Give me oysters and beer every day of the year and I'll be fine," Jimmy Buffett.
From the small oyster bar upstairs to the larger and lively tavern downstairs, King Eider's many-awards-winning pub in Damariscotta is a splendid place to spend an evening -- or even an afternoon. The menu is huge, the selection of beer and other beverages not much smaller, and the friendly hi-neighbor, how-ya-doin' atmosphere makes regulars out of all first-time patrons -- including us!
[bullet] Sea Dog, Topsham: We've probably written more about this tavern than any restaurant in Maine -- partly because we eat here a lot, even when we're not writing travel columns! Favorite brews here are Old East India Pale Ale for me and Owls Head Light Ale for Linda. The Sea Dog's menu is unusually long and creative for a tavern. They include suggested pairings of beer and list the farms where they got the ingredients. There are lots of seafood dishes, steaks, salads, burgers (of course) and an entire section of Italian choices. And, surprisingly, this Sea Dog offers one of the best Sunday brunches in the state.
[bullet] Geaghan's, Bangor: While Portland grabs the headlines for foodies nationwide, Bangor's our kind of place, with savvy civic leaders, a great waterfront on the Penobscot River, awesome events like the American Folk Festival, a new Convention Center -- and the fabulous Geaghan's Pub. We rarely drive by Geaghan's, no matter where we are headed in northern and eastern Maine. Their Boneless Buffalo Wings have become famous. They actually aren't wings at all. They're chicken tenders served with a choice of sauces (honey BBQ, honey mustard or three levels of buffalo wing sauce). They account for 60 to 70 percent of Geaghan's takeout orders. And they sold 50,000 pounds of them last year!
[bullet] Mainely Brews, Waterville: If Luke Duplessis could turn every Post Office location that is closing into a Mainely Brews, people would happily forget about the mail. This is a fun place with a great pub atmosphere, superb microbrews and a surprising (and enticing) menu. One of our favorite dishes here is the Southwestern Chicken Rollups. These are tiny burritos filled with corn, black beans and chicken and then fried. The spicy ranch sauce makes these spectacular. Our daughter Hilary, who works in a high-end Washington, D.C. restaurant, joined us for a visit here and described it this way: "Incredibly delicious food, for surprisingly low prices, with some pretty spectacular locally brewed Maine beer." She got that right!

Full text:   Democratic state Sen. Chris Johnson and Republican Les Fossel are squaring off for the second time in two years in a swing district that has been heavily targeted by outside interests.
Second time in 2 years Johnson, Fossel battle for District 13's state senate seat
A sitting state senator faces a former legislator on the November ballot in a crucial race that's become familiar to voters in and around Lincoln County.
For the second time in two years, Sen. Chris Johnson, a Democrat from Somerville, is defending the seat against Les Fossel, a Republican from Alna, who lost to Johnson in 2012 after a recount.
It's expected to be close again in Senate District 13, a coastal, rural and Republican-leaning district made up of all of Lincoln County but Dresden, along with the towns of Windsor and Washington.
Fossel, a 68-year-old restoration contractor, was a moderate state representative from 2008 to 2012. Johnson, a 57-year-old information technology director, is co-chairman of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee and has been a leader on fishery issues, including the effect of ocean acidification on the shellfish industry.
Health care costs will be a large factor in the race. Both see pathways to expanding MaineCare, the federal-state health care program for the poor, under the Affordable Care Act. Republican Gov. Paul LePage repeatedly has vetoed plans to do that.
However, Johnson wants it done quickly, while Fossel said it should be done as part of a larger plan to contain high costs of care.
In 2013, Lincoln County had the oldest population among Maine counties, the nation's oldest state.
Maine is ranked 28th in median household income, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data, but spends $8,500 annually on health care per person, the fourth-highest total among U.S. states. In 2012, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services accounted for 45 percent of all state spending.
Fossel wants to establish a panel that would craft a bill to cut health care costs by 5 percent in Maine that could be followed by MaineCare expansion and perhaps a hike in Maine's minimum wage, at least for companies that contract with the state.
"To find the money, you've got to cut health care costs," Fossel said. "There's nothing else out there."
Johnson said expansion would help contain costs by focusing on preventive care, "because it's easier to keep people healthy instead of treating them when they get sick or injured." He said that, coupled with the economic benefit to Maine's health care industry, makes it necessary to expand soon.
"I just don't see the merit of his argument," Johnson said of Fossel's plan. "It makes much more sense to be proactive on health care."
The district in which the candidates are competing is a top swing area, where Republicans outnumber Democrats by about 1,500, but independents outnumber voters in any one party. David Trahan, a Republican who resigned from the Senate when he took a job as executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, held the seat before Johnson won an upset over Rep. Dana Dow, R-Waldoboro, in a February 2012 special election.
That November, Fossel lost to Johnson by less than 200 votes after a recount in a race that drew $169,000 in spending from outside groups, largely on ads and mail pieces. Again this year, it has been a top priority for outside Democratic groups looking to defend their narrow four-seat majority over Republicans in the Maine Senate. They have poured in more than $37,000 so far to boost Johnson, according to Maine ethics commission data, while Republicans have spent about $1,600.
As he did two years ago, Fossel is attacking Johnson as a partisan, calling him "the most liberal senator" in Maine. However, by the Sunlight Foundation's measure, Johnson was the fourth-most partisan Democrat in the Senate from 2013 to 2014.
"You have to expect those trends to continue," Fossel said. "He is, quite simply, not a moderate."
Johnson said he won't label his opponent, calling his style "pragmatic" and saying he has helped lots of farmers and small businesspeople in the district.
"If Les chooses to label that as liberal or not, that's up to him," Johnson said. "I'm working to try and find the best policy for Maine people."

Full text:   A sitting state senator faces a former legislator on the November ballot in a crucial race that's become familiar to voters in and around Lincoln County.
For the second time in two years, Sen. Chris Johnson, a Democrat from Somerville, is defending the seat against Les Fossel, a Republican from Alna, who lost to Johnson in 2012 after a recount.
It's expected to be close again in Senate District 13, a coastal, rural and Republican-leaning district made up of all of Lincoln County but Dresden, along with the towns of Windsor and Washington.
Fossel, a 68-year-old restoration contractor, was a moderate state representative from 2008 to 2012. Johnson, a 57-year-old information technology director, is co-chairman of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee and has been a leader on fishery issues, including the effect of ocean acidification on the shellfish industry.
Health care costs will be a large factor in the race. Both see pathways to expanding MaineCare, the federal-state health care program for the poor, under the Affordable Care Act. Republican Gov. Paul LePage repeatedly has vetoed plans to do that.
However, Johnson wants it done quickly, while Fossel said it should be done as part of a larger plan to contain high costs of care.
In 2013, Lincoln County had the oldest population among Maine counties, the nation's oldest state.
Maine is ranked 28th in median household income, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data, but spends $8,500 annually on health care per person, the fourth-highest total among U.S. states. In 2012, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services accounted for 45 percent of all state spending.
Fossel wants to establish a panel that would craft a bill to cut health care costs by 5 percent in Maine that could be followed by MaineCare expansion and perhaps a hike in Maine's minimum wage, at least for companies that contract with the state.
"To find the money, you've got to cut health care costs," Fossel said. "There's nothing else out there."
Johnson said expansion would help contain costs by focusing on preventive care, "because it's easier to keep people healthy instead of treating them when they get sick or injured." He said that, coupled with the economic benefit to Maine's health care industry, makes it necessary to expand soon.
"I just don't see the merit of his argument," Johnson said of Fossel's plan. "It makes much more sense to be proactive on health care."
The district in which the candidates are competing is a top swing area, where Republicans outnumber Democrats by about 1,500, but independents outnumber voters in any one party. David Trahan, a Republican who resigned from the Senate when he took a job as executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine, held the seat before Johnson won an upset over Rep. Dana Dow, R-Waldoboro, in a February 2012 special election.
That November, Fossel lost to Johnson by less than 200 votes after a recount in a race that drew $169,000 in spending from outside groups, largely on ads and mail pieces. Again this year, it has been a top priority for outside Democratic groups looking to defend their narrow four-seat majority over Republicans in the Maine Senate. They have poured in more than $37,000 so far to boost Johnson, according to Maine ethics commission data, while Republicans have spent about $1,600.
As he did two years ago, Fossel is attacking Johnson as a partisan, calling him "the most liberal senator" in Maine. However, by the Sunlight Foundation's measure, Johnson was the fourth-most partisan Democrat in the Senate from 2013 to 2014.
"You have to expect those trends to continue," Fossel said. "He is, quite simply, not a moderate."
Johnson said he won't label his opponent, calling his style "pragmatic" and saying he has helped lots of farmers and small businesspeople in the district.
"If Les chooses to label that as liberal or not, that's up to him," Johnson said. "I'm working to try and find the best policy for Maine people."

Full text:   The Slipway Restaurant in Thomaston is THE place where locals and visitors go for seafood, but we discovered lots of other menu choices there for those who don't like to dine from the sea. Joining us for dinner were our daughter Rebekah with her in-laws, Noreen and Randy, along with our youngest grandson Vishal.
Chef/owner Scott Yakovenko, who grew up in this area and once had a very popular restaurant in Port Clyde, has a stellar reputation for seafood, so I chose the grilled scallops ($9.50) appetizer with arugula, spinach, lemon and EVOO -- which Rebekah explained was extra virgin olive oil. Boy, I am learning a lot with these travel columns!
The portion was generous so I shared the scallops with Randy and Noreen. The scallops were prepared just the way I like them, charred on the outside but nearly raw inside. I also asked our server, Emily (a very friendly Thomaston native and mother working here for the third summer) to bring me a taste of the clam chowder -- and afterward, really wished I'd ordered more. Lots of clams, nicely salted creamy broth.
For an entree, Noreen talked me into the Bouillabaisse ($24), which she enjoyed on her last visit here. It wasn't a hard sell. The Bouillabaisse included local lobster, crab, fish, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters and scallops in a tomato and saffron broth. Delivered in a large bowl, with a lobster claw on top, this was a memorable seafood feast.
Noreen enjoyed a linguini special ($24.50) with mahogany clams, hake, scallops, leeks and chorizo sausage. Randy went with the fish and chips ($12.50), often my choice, while Vishal made short shrift of his chicken fingers ($8.50). Everything on the table looked good and tasted even better.
Rebekah, like Linda (a person who doesn't eat fish), was very pleased by her selection, so I asked her to tell you about it. Here's what she wrote:
"The Summer Vegetarian Plate ($14.50) provided a panoply of colors. Served on a rectangular plate, it began with a green salad bright with multicolored peppers, and also included coleslaw, beets, potatoes, fried tofu, corn on the cob and rice. The corn, from a local farm, was particularly delicious. I'm not usually a coleslaw fan, but this was scrumptious. For those who don't prefer fish, the vegetarian plate offered a wonderful option that was both beautifully presented and tasty."
It was also huge -- so, good Dad that I am, I helped her with it.

We were greeted at the entrance by Nora, the summer hostess here, who teaches at the Riley School, in Rockport, where our grandsons Addison and Vishal have been students. It was so good to see her and she made us feel very welcome, giving us a choice of rooms and tables. It was a rainy night so we couldn't choose the tables out on the dock, but I'll bet they are very popular in nice weather.
If you don't eat fish, like me, you will still find some nice choices at the Slipway. My entree of Chicken Milanese, a crispy chicken cutlet served with a lemon and caper butter sauce, was sooo good. The seasoned coating made the cutlet crispy on the outside, while still being moist on the inside. A medley of five kinds of fresh vegetables and the best rice I have had in a very long time rounded out my dinner.
Vishal is a kid who needs to be always busy, so while the adults were talking, he got out his pad of paper and began drawing things he noticed around the room and asking us, after he completed each one, to guess what he'd drawn. Then he moved on to drawing fish. When Emily stopped by and noticed one of this fish drawings, she returned to the kitchen and brought Vishal a dish with a fish painted on it for his French fries. I wish we had captured his smile when he saw that dish!
When I looked around at the end of our meal, I noticed that everyone had cleaned their plates. That speaks volumes.
I ordered the chocolate torte for dessert, thankful that I didn't have an appetizer because it would have been a shame to miss this dessert. The torte was chocolaty and bittersweet, and paired perfectly with a raspberry sauce drizzle and dollop of whipped cream. All of the dessert portions were large.
Vishal is all about ice cream and dove into his sundae with Grampy sneaking his spoon over when he could.
Scott's mom, Sandy, makes all the desserts here and we tried four of them, all of which were superb. So when Emily told us Scott's mom was in the restaurant that night, we sought her out to say hi and let her know we loved her desserts. Coconut cream pie is one of George's favorites, and he told Sandy hers was the best he'd ever had.
What a great place to enjoy a summer or fall meal, with a nice view of the St. George River and wonderful food. This is Maine, through and through. And now we know why it is so popular.
You better go soon because this seasonal restaurant closes in mid-October. And if you don't make it this year, we'll remind you again when the Slipway opens next summer!

I was reading Dad's newspaper the other day, in his room at the Togus VA Hospice Unit, when a full-page ad grabbed my attention. Sponsored by individual board members of the Poland Spring Preservation Society, the ad was a very big thank you to Poland Spring Bottling Company for "being a great neighbor."
"The Poland Spring Preservation Society was formed in 1976," noted the ad, "to maintain the Maine State Building and All Soul Chapel. Without the support of Poland Spring Bottling and other generous sponsors, these buildings would not be here today."
The ad reminded me of the time we visited the Bottling Museum, Maine State Building and All Souls Chapel next to the Poland Spring Resort. These are fascinating places you should put on your bucket list.
In the ad, I learned that Hiram Ricker began selling bottled water in 1845. By 1907 a state-of-the-art bottling facility and springhouse were constructed using Spanish architecture. Poland Spring Water won the "Best Water Award" at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago. Linda and I really enjoyed seeing the museum, which also has recreational trails throughout the property.
All three buildings are stunning. Ten Maine quarries donated granite for the Maine State Building, and the slate shingles came from Monson. As the Preservation Society noted in the ad, the building, "is our symbol of Maine Pride."
If you are a golfer, you will particularly enjoy the Maine Golf Hall of Fame in this building which also houses the Nettie Ricker art gallery, a museum and a gift shop.
The All Souls Chapel was opened in 1912 as a place of worship. Today it's used mostly for weddings and musical concerts, but it is also a very spiritual place. The Chapel's nine stained glass windows are beautiful, and the great pipes of the 1926 Skinner Pipe Organ still make wonderful music. My mom, a church organist, would have loved this organ.
The Bottling Museum is open mid-May until mid-October, Thursday - Saturday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Maine State Building is also open mid-May until mid-October, Tuesday -- Saturday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sundays 9-11 a.m. For more information call 998-4142 or check out their website at www.polandspringps.org.
And while you are in the area, don't miss the nearby Shaker Village in New Gloucester. It's open year-round. -- George

Full text:   We'd drive all the way to Deer Isle to eat at the Whale's Rib Tavern, but it's helpful that the restaurant is in a gorgeous and historic inn because we wouldn't want to drive all the way home after dinner!
Last June, with our friends Rusty and Sue Atwood, Linda and I enjoyed a wonderful getaway weekend on Deer Isle at the Pilgrim's Inn. Deer Isle, Stonington and Blue Hill are full of interesting art galleries, book stores, gift shops and stunning scenery. We spent a morning hiking to Barred Island and a beautiful isolated beach.
At the end of June we told you all about that trip. But we saved the best for last -- the food!
The inn has a very nice cozy bar with two sitting rooms nearby. Arriving late on Friday night, we quickly moved into our cottages and headed to the bar where we ordered up drinks and sat in one of the rooms, admiring the amazing fireplace and beautiful works of art. I studied the tavern's dinner menu, anticipating a great feast.
Tina Oddleifson and Tony Lawless purchased the inn nine years ago. They are very hospitable hosts, focused on the details that make your stay comfortable and enjoyable, but it's in the restaurant that their experience really shines through. Tina attended Cambridge Culinary School when Tony taught there, before they married and purchased the inn.
While there are several great places to eat in the area, the Whale's Rib Tavern offers the finest dining. We got a taste of the place with breakfast in the tavern on Saturday morning -- scrumptious blueberry pancakes, fruit, juice and coffee, and, of course, real maple syrup. We loved the room, decorated with historic artifacts, with lots of windows and nicely spaced tables -- a place to linger. No rush to turn over tables here.
Dinner was, well, I have to say spectacular. A lengthy list of house cocktails, good selection of Maine brews (including several gluten free) and a very special wine list made our first dinner decision difficult. We opted for our tried and true, a Chianti from La Striscia in Italy, priced very reasonably at $30.
But the decisions only got tougher. Because Linda doesn't like (or cook) fish, I often order seafood on our travel column visits to restaurants. Two appetizers jumped out at me: local mussels steamed in white wine, garlic and butter, for $11; and smoked haddock clam chowder for $7. Concerned that the mussels might fill me up, I ordered the clam chowder.
Good choice. The chowder included large chunks of potato and haddock, was thick, nicely salted and arrived in a beautiful bowl. I took our food to another table, with better sunlight, for photos, amusing the couple sitting at the next table. They were from Iowa and have visited the Pilgrim's Inn several times.
Presentation matters when you are writing travel columns, and Tony and Tina really know how to present their dishes. But even I was surprised, the next day, to discover that I'd taken more than 75 dinner photos.
Perusing the list of entrees, I knew I was in trouble. I wanted them all! Thankfully, with four of us at the table and only six choices, I got to try four of them. Rusty saved the day by ordering the grilled ribeye ($26). It would have been my choice, but I would have missed out on the amazing sea scallops ($26).
That dish featured four huge seared fennel-dusted sea scallops with a very tasty rosemary white-bean puree. The dark and salty olive tapenade and fried capers added flavor. I loved this dish.
Rusty's ribeye was so good that I asked how it was prepared. The one and a half-inch thick steak was grilled in a cast iron fry pan in canola oil for 2 minutes a side with pepper and spices added, then placed in a 400-degree oven for eight minutes. It was a good thing he was seated opposite me at the table, out of reach, or I'd have eaten more of it!
At some point in the evening, Tina told us that Chef Max, who lives right down the street, worked with the local school on healthy eating initiatives. Thank goodness he didn't insist on those that night! I ate gluttonously, with the excuse that many of the ingredients in our dishes came from the area's well-known organic farms.
I returned to our cottage stuffed and satisfied. But regular readers won't be surprised that I mustered the next morning for another great breakfast in the tavern: an omelet with red pepper, chive, cheddar and sausage, served with sourdough bread. I am certain, given Max's reputation, that it was a healthy start for another wonderful day in Deer Isle.
Dinner at the Whale's Rib Tavern is not to be missed. The dining space, once a former barn, features barn-board walls and a top shelf full of wonderful antiques that circle the room. Wooden floors and small-paned windows add to the cozy atmosphere. During our leisurely early summer dinner, a rainstorm passed through. Servers closed up the double screen doors and patrons happily relaxed into their meals wishing to linger there as long as possible.
Sue and I quickly settled on the Arugula, Fennel, Grapefruit and Apple Salad to begin our meal. It was a refreshingly light combination that went well with their Dijon champagne vinaigrette.
Sue thoroughly enjoyed her entree of duck breast with wild rice, water chestnuts and wilted greens. Beautifully presented, she commented that it had a great balance of textures.
Tina told us how lucky they are to be located within a "local farm mecca." She named two cheese makers, a farm raising organic chicken and the presence of three local farmers markets. "We have very fresh local ingredients readily available," she reported. We could tell they take full advantage of that and the chef really shines.
When my eyes landed on the porchetta entree, I was transported back to a great day in Italy at a farmers market in the town square. George got hungry while we made our way through the stalls with everything from hardware and clothing to vegetables and cheese. Spotting a cart serving something on a bun that everyone seemed to be eating, we found out it was a porchetta sandwich. They must have roasted the whole suckling pig, as its head was on display on the counter! We split one sandwich and it was heavenly. I barely got two bites, but its memory still lingers.
Porchetta is pork shoulder and pork loin rolled together, filled with fennel, sage and rosemary and slowly roasted. The tavern's version was moist and tender on the inside, had a crispy outside crust, and held a deep flavor from the herbs. The dish was finished with creamy rosemary polenta and Swiss chard. What an amazing meal! It is an entree I have never noticed on a menu before, but will certainly be looking out for.
I'd never heard of Boca Negra cake before, but it turns out it was made famous by Julia Child. Heads up all chocolate cravers: This one is intensely chocolate, made even more decadent by being served with a white chocolate ganache. Both couples at our table ordered one to split, and we all left with big grins on our faces.

One of the volunteers at the Lubec Library during our visit handed me a brochure of a Sculpture Tour located throughout Down East Maine. The Schoodic International Symposium is a self-guided tour of public stone sculptures created by artists from all over the world. Lubec will be getting one, but there are already 19 on the current list.
I was pretty excited to get started since we pass through many towns that are on the list. First off, I recognized one I had seen in Southwest Harbor a few weeks earlier. Easy directions to each sculpture led us to the ones in Machias and Roque Bluffs on our way to Jonesboro. We knocked off five more the next day on our regular route home.
The scale of these creations will make you appreciate all the artistry and logistics involved. It is impressive art that it's right out in the open in some beautiful Maine towns. It's kind of like our own personal treasure hunt. If I hadn't had the brochure handed to me, we'd have kept right on driving by them without stopping to notice!
Put this activity on your list for whenever you find yourself Down East. Info can be found at www.schoodicsculpture.org. Try to see them all before we do! -- Linda

Full text:   There's a great big target on the backs of predator green crabs now, thanks to rule changes by the Maine Department of Marine Resources that went into effect this week.
As of Aug. 10, commercial fishermen no longer will need a special license to harvest and sell green crabs, and they won't have to report their green crab harvests to the DMR. Lobstermen will be allowed to take them as bycatch. And when the Sheepscot, Damariscotta and Medomak rivers are closed for fishing other species of crabs between Dec. 1 and April 30, fishermen still will be able to harvest green crabs from those waters.
The efforts to increase the harvest of green crabs are part of a raft of public and private efforts underway to rid Maine's coastal waters of the invasive species, which prey on the state's valuable shellfish population and wreak havoc on eel grass. Although the critters, which can be anywhere from two-and-a-half to 5 inches long, have been reported in Maine for more than a century, scientists speculate that warming ocean temperatures have allowed the crabs to multiply. The crabs feast on bivalves such as softshell clams, which are Maine's third-most-lucrative fishery. In 2013, 10.6 million pounds of softshell clams were valued at $16.9 million. But that was down from 11.1 million landed in 2012, according to the DMR, a decline partly attributable to damage from green crabs. In December, hundreds of researchers gathered at the University of Maine in Orono to discuss the issue at a Green Crab Summit. In February, Gov. Paul LePage ordered the creation of a task force to study their effect and potential solutions. As a result, Brunswick, Freeport, West Bath and Harpswell are studying the most effective ways to trap green crabs.
As awareness about the problem has grown, so has the effort to harvest crabs. In 2013, there were 52 licenses to fish green crabs, and 10,596 pounds were harvested, according to preliminary data from the DMR. The year before, 36 licenses were issued and 3,762 pounds landed.
Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are exploring opportunities to turn the predators into profits by marketing green crabs for everything from fish food to gourmet meals.
"The rule changes certainly makes things easier," said Dan Devereaux, a Marine Resources Officer in Brunswick.
Since 2012, he's seen a decline in softshell clams that he directly attributes to the increase in green crabs. As a result, he reduced the town's number of commercial shellfish licenses from 57 to 50, and anticipates more reductions going forward. He told state officials during public hearings about the rule changes that Brunswick has scrambled to purchase traps to harvest green crabs, describing their predation as "a serious threat to the shellfish resource, marine ecosystem and economic environment not only for Brunswick but for all other coastal communities."
In the last year, researchers have been working at monitoring the green crab population with an eye toward managing it.
Marine biologist Darcie Couture, who is studying the green crabs in Brunswick and Harpswell, said that her team saw the population of green crabs peak in July. The catch now is starting to taper off closer to shore, but in deep waters off of Harpswell, the harvests are still large.
"We're still pulling out hundreds of pounds each week," said Couture, a signal to her that there's a sustainable population in deep water. Last year they didn't see green crab catch numbers fall until winter.
The hope is that the pattern that's emerging this year will repeat itself next year so researchers can identify a distinct "green crab season." That would allow fishermen and towns to prepare for it by putting traps in strategic places to protect their shellfish resources in the spring, and keep traps there until the end of the season.
"Once we identify a pattern, towns can make this an ingrained part of their management strategy," she said. "We don't have a complete understanding of what the season is yet. We're just starting to build that data set."
Brian Beal, a marine ecology researcher at the University of Maine at Machias, has been doing a series of studies in Freeport, tracking crabs and assessing how they're affecting clams in the area. In Freeport, the green crab catch is below levels they saw last year, and the weight of average catch per trap is less than 1 pound.
Couture said the attention has spawned a stream of calls from entrepreneurs who are looking at potential new markets for the pesky creatures. Some are looking for new ways to process the crabs to capture their meat and others are looking at new uses for their shells and other components.
"We haven't seen any leaps in progress, but that's a path that remains open," Couture said. "We'll continue to work with anyone who is interested in trying to find a commercial use."
Margaret Harrington, manager of Harrington Bait in Woolwich, hopes that one of those commercial uses will be bait. Her store sells bloodworms and sandworms, and she sees a steady demand from fishermen who want green crab as bait. If there's a viable market, she said, she would consider building a processing operation.
"We're always interested in expanding what we're able to sell," she said.

Full text:   Market-based approach has led to 20 percent reduction while region's GDP up 22 percent
The regional head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said New England's market-based approach to reducing carbon dioxide emissions shows that states can fight climate change while still improving the economy.
Curt Spalding, EPA administrator for New England, suggested that Maine and most other Northeastern states already had compiled a "toolbox of tools" to meet proposed EPA rules for slashing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants nationwide. The goal now, Spalding said, is to put in place a national framework flexible enough to work in all states.
"What this rule tries to do ... is to take advantage of the building blocks that have been put in place in places like New England," Spalding told several dozen people in a University of Southern Maine lecture hall.
Spalding spoke about the EPA's proposed carbon standards for power plants during an unofficial "listening session" in Portland organized by the Natural Resources Council of Maine, the Island Institute and the Voter Education Brigade. "The first goal is to get the framework in place so that the kinds of continuous improvement experience we've had here in New England can happen everywhere," Spalding said.
Spalding noted that New England's gross domestic product has increased 22 percent since 1999, while carbon emissions have declined 20 percent.
In June, the EPA unveiled proposed rules that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 as part of the Obama administration's effort to reduce greenhouse gas pollution linked to climate change. Each state was given a different target, with Maine expected to reduce emissions by 13.5 percent by 2030.
The EPA is still discussing technical details of how New England's existing carbon emission reduction system -- the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI -- will mesh with the proposed state-by-state emissions reductions slated to take effect in 2020. However, Spalding said the proposed rules were designed to be flexible and should enhance existing programs such as RGGI.
Spalding was in Maine days after a dozen other states filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA proposal and roughly one week after several thousand people attended public hearings held in four cities around the country. Speakers at those public hearings were deeply divided with the strongest opposition coming from coal country and areas where coal is the dominant source of fuel for power plants.
The crowd at Portland's unofficial "listening session" was decidedly friendly. Speakers warned that a warming climate was already affecting Maine's commercial fisheries and could have dramatic effects on lobsters, clams and other shellfish as higher carbon levels lead to more acidic oceans.
"If we do not cut carbon emissions now, particularly from power plants, it becomes much more difficult if not impossible to protect ourselves from the worst ravages of climate change," said Tom Tietenberg, a professor emeritus of economics at Colby College who has researched climate policies. "The window of opportunity is closing. The time to act is now."
Dr. Tony Owens, an emergency physician at Maine Medical Center, said he admitted three people Tuesday who attributed their breathing problems to poorer air quality. "I see the effects everyday," Owens said.
The EPA's carbon reduction plans have been noncontroversial so far in Maine, largely because the six major power plants in the state already have been operating under a carbon-reduction plan for five years. Additionally, there are no coal-fired power plants in the state.
RGGI is a nine-state program that imposes a cap on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-burning power plants and then requires those facilities to buy credits for each ton they emit. Credits are traded on a carbon market like other commodities, generating revenue for energy conservation or home weatherization in Maine while giving regulated facilities a financial incentive to reduce emissions below their caps.
Emissions from power plants in the nine states have fallen 40 percent, although market trends toward cleaner-burning natural gas and away from coal and oil are also major factors.
Spalding said it was too early to tell whether Maine and other RGGI states would be required to go beyond their current emissions reductions under the EPA proposal. The EPA and participating states must reconcile the different methods that the two systems use to calculate emissions.
"The thought around the rule is that these kinds of market-based approaches, under RGGI or other types around the country, are good things, and we hope this rule will encourage their success in time," Spalding said after the meeting.
Marc Cone, director of the air quality program at the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, said the states and the EPA are "working our way through" what he described as one of the most complicated air regulations ever proposed. Cone said his department wants more data on how the EPA calculated its baseline emissions levels and goals to ensure that the state is given credit for its high reliance on renewable energy and successful carbon reduction to date.
Cone said the DEP is "certainly hopeful" that Maine will get credit for its progress under RGGI. "But sometimes the details need to be fleshed out ... and some of the details are still fuzzy," Cone said.
The EPA is accepting public comment on the carbon dioxide reduction proposal through Oct. 16. To submit a comment, go to http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards;http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards.

Full text:   The only disappointing thing about the Maine State Music Theater is that Linda and I only manage to get there once each season. Every musical we've seen there over the years has been exceptional.
This summer, I chose the musical without consulting Linda. I love history and wanted to see "Chamberlain, a Civil War Romance." OK, it would not have been Linda's first choice, particularly after she heard from friends that the first musical of the season, "The Buddy Holly Story," was so fantastic.
I sweetened the evening by suggesting dinner at the Sea Dog Brewing Company in Topsham, one of our favorite pubs. We've probably written about the Sea Dog more than any other place -- including their amazing Sunday brunches. Last year, arriving in Portland following two weeks in Italy, we bee-lined it to Topsham for one of the Dog's great burgers. No burgers in Italy!
While a bit disappointed that every table on the outside deck (overlooking the Androscoggin River) was taken, we took an inside table by a window, enjoying the air conditioning on a very hot day. We had just one hour to spend at dinner and were pleased by the fast, attentive service.
Not long after we ordered, we spotted long-time manager, Seth, clearing tables. He also delivers food. Seth does it all here!
Given that Sea Dog brews many fine beers, we didn't need an excuse to start with two of our favorites, Old East India Pale Ale for me, Owls Head Light Ale for Linda. Very refreshing.
The Sea Dog's menu is unusually long and creative for a pub. They include suggested food/beer pairings and list the farms where they got the ingredients. There are lots of seafood dishes, steaks, salads, burgers (of course) and an entire section of Italian choices (Littlenecks and Linguine for $16 looked good, as did the Pistachio-Basil Pesto Pasta for the same price). My eyes lingered for a while over the Baked Fisherman's Pie for $15.
There were 10 items just on the specials menu and they all sounded delicious, from the Fried Oysters for $11 to the desserts that included fresh strawberries, vanilla waffles, peanut butter cup ice cream and chocolate sauce. Wow!
Linda and I focused on the specials because we like to encourage chefs to be creative. I ordered the Smokey Cuban ($14) -- smoked and pulled organic pork shoulder, mustard sauce, provolone cheese, fennel-dill slaw, Canadian ham and mustard pickles. The pork came from Dragonfly Farms in Durham.
I have eaten Cuban (Cubano) sandwiches from Maine to New Orleans. It's probably my favorite sandwich. The Sea Dog's was one of the best I've ever eaten. It was packed with meat and slaw, and really messy. Just the way I like it! The tart mustard sauce and pickles gave it a lot of pop. Even the bread was special. And the fries that came with the sandwich were nice and crispy.
Bob and Pat Morang saw us on their way out. Bob's a church organist and public school music teacher, so he really knows music. He and Pat had just seen the afternoon presentation of Chamberlain and raved about it. They were right. The show was fantastic.
We got to the theater in time to enjoy the outside Civil War "encampment" and a wonderful group of young people -- in period dress -- singing for us.
We're going to make a special effort to get to the theater Aug. 6-23 for "Footloose." I'm certain that one will be really great. And the special "Footlight Follies" on Aug. 11 sounds intriguing, described as "an evening of songs, skits and silliness combining the best of talents provided by community members, our own MSMT acting company, staff and Board of Trustees and surprise guests. It's nonstop FUN starting at 6:45 p.m. when our seven outside stages of entertainment come alive with an eclectic display of talent! FOOTLIGHT FOLLIES is an evening of "theatre" with virtually no rules, featuring skits, singing, dancing, music comedy and more."
In our press packet at the Music Theater was a paddle with Joshua Chamberlain's picture on it. The good news is that Linda enjoyed the musical so she didn't use the paddle on me!
Dinner and a musical -- what a great way to spend a Maine summer evening. Our dinner at Sea Dog with a view of the river was followed by a stroll on Bowdoin's beautiful campus. The show itself was great. Great costuming, sets and songs performed by wonderful actors are all things you can count on at the Maine State Music Theater. Every time I see a show here, it makes me regret that we are not season ticket holders.
For as many times as we have been to the Sea Dog in Topsham, I am still amazed by all the options on their menu and how many more I have yet to try! There are many choices of fish and seafood here. Interesting appetizers like fried pickles with pepper aioli would be a great way to start a meal. Hearty salads such as cashew quinoa, strawberry goat cheese and Brussels sprouts salad not only sounded good, but looked incredibly tempting as they went by. You would not go hungry ordering one of these. ($9-$11)
There are burgers galore here, including two kinds of veggie burgers. From past experience I can tell you that they are very good, but I witnessed their magic effect this visit. We were sitting near a dad and his little girl who was less than 2 years old. She was a very vocal baby and he was doing everything he could to entertain her. When her burger arrived, she went silent. Let's just say that she really focused and made short work of it! I wish I could have taped it. It certainly made me smile.
This trip I noticed the tempting specials menu and ordered the Brewers Tenderloin Tacos ($15). Soft corn tortillas held BBQ coffee-crusted pork tenderloin, sweet potatoes, cheese and fruit salsa. With tasty black bean rice and jalapeno sour cream on the side, I was a very happy diner. The fruit salsa makes this dish, but I loved the sweet potato in the taco as well. The pork was well-seasoned and very tender.
This was the most spectacular taco I ever remember eating! To top it all off, it was not messy. Now that's perfection. I sure hope they have this dish on the menu the next time we eat here.
At the theater afterwards, I spotted a lot of people we'd noticed at the Sea Dog. I swear everyone at the theater ate there, too! They are a perfect combination!
Jen Hazard knows tourism and travel. She lives it. Jen and her family are featured in a Maine tourism video this year, promoting family travel in our state. Jen noticed that the tourism website had nothing for young families, and reached out to them to fill that gap. You can see her video at vimeo.com/87023104.
She is also the social media staffer for Islandport Press in Yarmouth. And she's got her own website, www.cutepotato.com, a terrific source of information for parents. You can join her email list and access her family travel blog at www.jenhazard.com.
Jen originally focused on promoting events and places that appeal to kids and their parents. Today the website offers all kinds of helpful information from books to restaurants. In fact, when I stopped in last week at Islandport Press to pick up more copies of my book, Jen had a list of restaurant recommendations for the Travelin Maine(rs)! And they sure sound great!

Don't get me wrong. Given my choice of Portland or Stratton, for pretty much everything I enjoy in Maine, you'd find me in Stratton every time. And now, the only thing missing for me in some rural Maine areas is available there: fabulous food.
Plus it doesn't take us any longer to drive to Stratton than to Portland, and the views traveling north are outstanding. So get in your car sometime soon, enjoy the ride and dine at the Coplin Dinner House.
Heidi Donovan and Tony Rossi have turned an old farmhouse into an amazing restaurant. Sitting in their very comfortable chairs (secured from an old barn in New Hampshire), gazing out the window at Heidi's beautiful flowers, then turning my head to enjoy one of the stunning photos of John Orcutt on the wall and listening to Tony tell us about the food, I am in restaurant heaven.
Heidi and Tony are very personable, enthusiastic and welcoming, and have put a great deal of thought into every detail of their restaurant, from the silverware to the layout of tables (Heidi gives the staff credit for this). There is a nice variety of seating, from a private space for a dozen guests, to tucked-away tables for couples, to the very popular bar in the back, to outside seating in the summer and fall.
Last winter we wrote about brunch here and were pleased, when we arrived this time, to hear that four ladies who had read that column had driven up from Waterville to enjoy brunch the previous weekend, taking the scenic route through Rangeley on the way home. This would make a great day for anyone from central Maine.
Since our brunch there, we've been hankering to return for dinner, and that opportunity finally arrived on the Fourth of July. What a way to celebrate the Fourth!
Of the nine appetizers, I focused on the Grilled Asian Style Pork Belly ($11.99).
"That's too filling, too much fat," Linda proclaimed.
So I ended up with fried Brussels sprouts. With the first bite, I forgot all about the pork belly. Probably because the dish included pancetta, which Linda kindly informed me, "It's meat. Italian bacon." No wonder I loved it! Actually, the candied pecans provided a nice crunch and the sweet soy made this very tasty.
Because Linda whips up wonderful salads every night from her extensive gardens, we passed on the four choices of salads and focused on entrees. This was a very tough decision. The dozen entrees all sounded terrific, from the Rack of Lamb and Roast Duckling to the Red Thai Curry, Prosciutto Wrapped Cod and Hanger Steak.
As we discussed each entree with Tony, and got to the Pan-Seared North Atlantic Halibut, we got into an extensive discussion about this fish -- my favorite. And of course, I had to tell him about my Alaskan fishing trip in which we caught halibut up to 280 pounds.
Halfway down the list of entrees, my eyes settled on Grilled Meatloaf ($18.99). Tony said it's a very popular dish -- and indeed, we spied several plates of it going by our table to other guests. The pork comes from Tony and Heidi's own pigs. He adds some local ground beef and gorgonzola, and includes whipped potatoes and a mushroom demi-glace. Oh, oh, oh, I wanted it.
But I went with the advice of our server, Steve White, (a guy who started his career at Sugarloaf in 1965 and is a very entertaining story teller), and picked my second choice, Shrimp Putanesca. I now owe Steve big time for his advice. It was very tasty with capers, kalamata olives, aged parmesan and a red sauce over perfectly cooked fettuccini. Adding taste and crunch were lightly cooked snow peas and a carrot. When Lin tried it, she figured it out immediately, exclaiming, "It tastes like Italy. All the flavors of Italy."
And then she looked up at me and said, "I think you have a piece of food on your cheek. It looks like a mole and I know you don't have a mole there." It's helpful to have a wife who knows what you look like. And yes, the food was so delicious I was wearing it.
We enjoyed glasses of Renacer Punto Final Malbec, 2012, from Medoza, Argentina ($9/glass). Heidi recently toured several wineries in the Rockland area to add Maine wines to her already impressive list. Many diners were enjoying Heidi's special drinks ($8 each). And they had three of my favorite Maine beers on tap: Shipyard's Summer Ale, Baxter's IPA and Geary's Pale Ale -- all for just $4.
After a fantastic brunch last winter at the Coplin Dinner House, we could hardly wait to go back for dinner. The atmosphere is perfect -- an old farmhouse renovated into intimate dining rooms, each set with white tablecloths and fresh flowers.
Heidi has beautiful flower gardens out front which were visible from our table. She's also got some vegetable gardens growing, runs the bar at the restaurant and has a young daughter. How she balances everything I don't know, but her smile and ease with conversation puts her guests right at home.
We'd reread our first column about the restaurant before we visited this time. And that's when I remembered the incredible tomatillo soup we'd fallen in love with. "It would probably be wrong to have the tomatillo soup again," I stated on the drive up. "Well I'm having it if it's on the menu," was George's quick reply. We didn't have to repeat as it was not on the menu at this time of year.
But I figured if Tony could make soup like that I'd better try today's version. Two Cool Summer Soups were offered. One was Local Spring Pea and Mint soup. The chilled cup of fresh green pea puree held all kinds of flavor and was accented with fresh mint. What a great combination! It was eye-rolling good.
The other cup was Watermelon Tomato Basil. Now there is no way in my mind that watermelon and tomato should work together but believe me, it does. Tony had thickened the soup a bit with breadcrumbs to prevent it from being watery. The basil in this made it sing. I deem him a soup genius! The soups came with a nice green salad with strawberries and made a perfectly light starter.
Choosing an entree was a bit harder, but I settled on the Statler Chicken Breast. Steve told us it is a version of what used to be served on airlines. The moist chicken had a crispy exterior and was topped with an apricot glaze and goat cheese crumbles. The sweet of the fruit and the salty seasoning turned this into an outstanding chicken dish. With side servings of fluffy whipped potatoes and bright green snow peas, this entree was as pretty as it was yummy.
A couple with two young children were dining nearby. They were raising some very adventurous eaters. The kids tried the raw oysters and steamed edamame (fresh soy beans in the pod) just for the warm up. You've got to love seeing kids giving new foods a try and being able to talk about food. The little girl declared the Creme Brulee "the best thing I've ever eaten in my entire life!"
At one point, Heidi pointed out a deer walking toward us in the road. Coming to dine in Heidi's vegetable garden, I thought.
I knew George was counting on dessert, since I didn't allow him to order it with brunch last time. He wanted the heaviest thing on the menu -- a Chocolate Bailey's Brownie Bread Pudding with Chocolate Chip Ice Cream -- but I convinced him to split the Raspberry Peach Cobbler. It was plenty big enough to share and came with caramel swirl ice cream. The hot-cold of the fruit and the ice cream along with the sweet and tart of the crumble and the fruit made a perfect balance.
It took us an hour and ten minutes from our house to the Coplin Dinner House. It is one of those very special places that is well worth the drive.

suggesting conspiracy
Don Gellers and his supporters believed he was being framed in a conspiracy involving the police, the courts, the Attorney General's Office and the Indian whose estranged wife he had become involved with, all with the aim of retiring the Passamaquoddy's hated and effective defender.
The evidence suggests they were correct.
A prominent Boston trial lawyer, Harvey Silverglate, soon came forward with a remarkable story: On April 18, 1968 -- just a month after Gellers' arrest -- he had had cocktails in a Bangor restaurant with Assistant Attorney General John Kelly, who bragged to him that "the powers that be in this state" were going to take down Gellers with the marijuana charge because he was a "troublemaker" who was "stirring up the Indians" and they "wanted to get him off the Indian suit." They were using Danny Bassett, an Indian whose wife was romantically involved with the young attorney, to help them get their man.
Silverglate later testified that Kelly had told him the AG's office had been working with Danny so that he "would have his revenge" and that "ultimately, if they could convict Gellers of a marijuana charge or any drug charge, they would proceed to disbar him and get him out of the case."
"(Kelly) said Danny was going to be the instrumentality in getting to Gellers," Silverglate told the court. "I took it to mean it was a setup."
Silverglate, who became a prominent and highly respected civil liberties lawyer, still recalls the scene 46 years later. "The prosecutor was talking about getting Gellers, and it was obvious to me they were looking to win the Indian suit by disabling the lawyer," says Silverglate, who came to Maine to give testimony in Gellers' hearing for a new trial. "It's not unprecedented that prosecutors would go after the lawyer who was giving them aggravation."
Silverglate himself felt vulnerable coming to Maine to testify against the authorities. "I don't think they were very happy about having me testify, and I was sure Gellers wouldn't be the last to be retaliated against for taking on an unpopular cause," says Silverglate, whose clients have included Leona Helmsley, Michael Milken and the Church of Scientology. "That's why, as soon as I testified, I got the hell out of town."
A federal prisoner in Ohio, Scott Workman, later sent Gellers' former intern, Tom Tureen, a signed affidavit, saying he had been released from the Hancock County Jail in September 1967 after agreeing with a state trooper to play the role of the Patriarca gangster in the forthcoming sting.
"Sgt. Joe McCarthy came down into the basement and called me to the side and told me that an attorney by the name of Gellers was a troublemaker who was stirring up the Indians down there, and that they were going to get him," Workman wrote. If Workman would "pose as a runaway gunman" from the Patriarca family and help state police Detective W. Lawrence Hall "in planting marijuana in Gellers' home," then the charges against him would be dismissed with the help of Assistant Attorney General Kelly.
Workman said he agreed and his charges were dropped. He claimed he later received word that "the deal is off," the implication being that the authorities had allegedly decided to have one of their own detectives play the role instead.
[bullet] [bullet] [bullet]
Kelly testified in court that he remembered having cocktails with Silverglate in April 1968, but had no recollection of discussing the Gellers case with him. Today, Kelly says he has no memory of being involved in either the restaurant conversation or the alleged deal with Workman, but he admits the Attorney General's Office behavior should raise eyebrows. "I was a freshman attorney and more of a gofer man, so they weren't bringing me into any high-level conversations," says Kelly, who now practices law in Portland. "I do recall being taken aback at the police action and the prosecution level and their attitude toward marijuana, which when you look back from the perspective of today was laughable."
"Obviously they were very motivated (to get Gellers)," he adds. "The facts speak for themselves."
Further, in 1968, Ed Hinckley was sacked as commissioner of the state's new Indian Affairs Department for refusing to cut his expenditures. Gov. Kenneth Curtis -- an important ally of the Indians -- appointed former Passamaquoddy tribal Gov. John Stevens to replace him. Before starting work, Stevens recalls Curtis asking him if there was anything he wanted to know. "I said, 'Yes, I want to know: Did you plant that stuff on Don Gellers?'" Stevens recalls. "If they planted it, I can't trust the state police."
Thereafter, Stevens says, he was invited to the governor's office. There, Hall, the police detective who'd posed as the Mafioso, reluctantly admitted to having "put all those cigarettes all over the house and inside Don Gellers' suit pockets." Curtis, Stevens said, was apologetic. Hall was not. "They didn't want to be exposed how they operate."
Reached at his Florida home, former Gov. Curtis said he couldn't recall the meeting but didn't deny it might have occurred. Hall also didn't recall the meeting, but said it could have happened, as he had known Curtis, who was a fellow Maine Maritime Academy alumnus. Hall said he would never have planted evidence himself, but couldn't vouch for Danny Bassett and other Indians who had unsupervised access to Gellers' home for several days during the operation.
Years later, Bangor Daily News reporter John Day wrote that in the months before the sting "there were persistent rumors in law enforcement circles about a state police investigation of Gellers." On returning from a meeting in Augusta in February 1968, Old Town Police Chief Otis N. LaBree told Day that "the boys in the Attorney General's Office were busting their tails to nail a lawyer up in Eastport on drug charges because he was 'stirring up the Indians,'" according to one of Day's published accounts, which appeared in 1980.
"I felt at the time they were really gunning for (Gellers) because he was an unpopular guy," says retired attorney Cushman Anthony, one of the only lawyers in Maine who was willing to represent Gellers on appeal. "They were trying to get rid of a grain of sand in the oyster."
[bullet] [bullet] [bullet]
Gellers believes the conspiracy extended all the way to Curtis' office, because he says he overheard Assistant Attorney General Richard Cohen placing a phone call there immediately after Gellers' conviction.
This seems unlikely, however, as the governor and Attorney General James Erwin were political rivals. Indeed Erwin, a conservative "law and order" Republican, ran against Curtis in the next election.
"It was very questionable as to whether or not Gellers was guilty," former Gov. Curtis recalls, adding his own relationship with the Attorney General's Office was "basically uncooperative."
"I think Gellers was so controversial to certain segments of the population that they tried to entrap him," Curtis says.
In another strange incident a few days after the sting, Gellers' friend and co-defendant Al Cox -- free on bail -- stepped out of Gellers' house to allegedly discover Danny Bassett and his nephew Anthony "Pluto" Stanley slashing the upholstery in the attorney's car and pouring sugar into the gas tank. When Gellers tried to press charges, he says the Attorney General's Office sent Detective Hall -- who was based in York County -- to act as a "special investigator" on the complaint. Stanley admitted he and Bassett were guilty -- Gellers says -- but Hall refused to believe his signed affidavit and the court in Calais refused to issue a complaint. (Hall today says he doesn't recall the incident.)
That law enforcement was working to get rid of an unpopular attorney seemed clear. The events that followed would also put the courts in an unfavorable light.

Full text:   Don Gellers and his supporters believed he was being framed in a conspiracy involving the police, the courts, the Attorney General's Office and the Indian whose estranged wife he had become involved with, all with the aim of retiring the Passamaquoddy's hated and effective defender.
The evidence suggests they were correct.
A prominent Boston trial lawyer, Harvey Silverglate, soon came forward with a remarkable story: On April 18, 1968 -- just a month after Gellers' arrest -- he had had cocktails in a Bangor restaurant with Assistant Attorney General John Kelly, who bragged to him that "the powers that be in this state" were going to take down Gellers with the marijuana charge because he was a "troublemaker" who was "stirring up the Indians" and they "wanted to get him off the Indian suit." They were using Danny Bassett, an Indian whose wife was romantically involved with the young attorney, to help them get their man.
Silverglate later testified that Kelly had told him the AG's office had been working with Danny so that he "would have his revenge" and that "ultimately, if they could convict Gellers of a marijuana charge or any drug charge, they would proceed to disbar him and get him out of the case."
"(Kelly) said Danny was going to be the instrumentality in getting to Gellers," Silverglate told the court. "I took it to mean it was a setup."
Silverglate, who became a prominent and highly respected civil liberties lawyer, still recalls the scene 46 years later. "The prosecutor was talking about getting Gellers, and it was obvious to me they were looking to win the Indian suit by disabling the lawyer," says Silverglate, who came to Maine to give testimony in Gellers' hearing for a new trial. "It's not unprecedented that prosecutors would go after the lawyer who was giving them aggravation."
Silverglate himself felt vulnerable coming to Maine to testify against the authorities. "I don't think they were very happy about having me testify, and I was sure Gellers wouldn't be the last to be retaliated against for taking on an unpopular cause," says Silverglate, whose clients have included Leona Helmsley, Michael Milken and the Church of Scientology. "That's why, as soon as I testified, I got the hell out of town."
A federal prisoner in Ohio, Scott Workman, later sent Gellers' former intern, Tom Tureen, a signed affidavit, saying he had been released from the Hancock County Jail in September 1967 after agreeing with a state trooper to play the role of the Patriarca gangster in the forthcoming sting.
"Sgt. Joe McCarthy came down into the basement and called me to the side and told me that an attorney by the name of Gellers was a troublemaker who was stirring up the Indians down there, and that they were going to get him," Workman wrote. If Workman would "pose as a runaway gunman" from the Patriarca family and help state police Detective W. Lawrence Hall "in planting marijuana in Gellers' home," then the charges against him would be dismissed with the help of Assistant Attorney General Kelly.
Workman said he agreed and his charges were dropped. He claimed he later received word that "the deal is off," the implication being that the authorities had allegedly decided to have one of their own detectives play the role instead.

Kelly testified in court that he remembered having cocktails with Silverglate in April 1968, but had no recollection of discussing the Gellers case with him. Today, Kelly says he has no memory of being involved in either the restaurant conversation or the alleged deal with Workman, but he admits the Attorney General's Office behavior should raise eyebrows. "I was a freshman attorney and more of a gofer man, so they weren't bringing me into any high-level conversations," says Kelly, who now practices law in Portland. "I do recall being taken aback at the police action and the prosecution level and their attitude toward marijuana, which when you look back from the perspective of today was laughable."
"Obviously they were very motivated (to get Gellers)," he adds. "The facts speak for themselves."
Further, in 1968, Ed Hinckley was sacked as commissioner of the state's new Indian Affairs Department for refusing to cut his expenditures. Gov. Kenneth Curtis -- an important ally of the Indians -- appointed former Passamaquoddy tribal Gov. John Stevens to replace him. Before starting work, Stevens recalls Curtis asking him if there was anything he wanted to know. "I said, 'Yes, I want to know: Did you plant that stuff on Don Gellers?'" Stevens recalls. "If they planted it, I can't trust the state police."
Thereafter, Stevens says, he was invited to the governor's office. There, Hall, the police detective who'd posed as the Mafioso, reluctantly admitted to having "put all those cigarettes all over the house and inside Don Gellers' suit pockets." Curtis, Stevens said, was apologetic. Hall was not. "They didn't want to be exposed how they operate."
Reached at his Florida home, former Gov. Curtis said he couldn't recall the meeting but didn't deny it might have occurred. Hall also didn't recall the meeting, but said it could have happened, as he had known Curtis, who was a fellow Maine Maritime Academy alumnus. Hall said he would never have planted evidence himself, but couldn't vouch for Danny Bassett and other Indians who had unsupervised access to Gellers' home for several days during the operation.
Years later, Bangor Daily News reporter John Day wrote that in the months before the sting "there were persistent rumors in law enforcement circles about a state police investigation of Gellers." On returning from a meeting in Augusta in February 1968, Old Town Police Chief Otis N. LaBree told Day that "the boys in the Attorney General's Office were busting their tails to nail a lawyer up in Eastport on drug charges because he was 'stirring up the Indians,'" according to one of Day's published accounts, which appeared in 1980.
"I felt at the time they were really gunning for (Gellers) because he was an unpopular guy," says retired attorney Cushman Anthony, one of the only lawyers in Maine who was willing to represent Gellers on appeal. "They were trying to get rid of a grain of sand in the oyster."
[bullet] [bullet] [bullet]
Gellers believes the conspiracy extended all the way to Curtis' office, because he says he overheard Assistant Attorney General Richard Cohen placing a phone call there immediately after Gellers' conviction.
This seems unlikely, however, as the governor and Attorney General James Erwin were political rivals. Indeed Erwin, a conservative "law and order" Republican, ran against Curtis in the next election.
"It was very questionable as to whether or not Gellers was guilty," former Gov. Curtis recalls, adding his own relationship with the Attorney General's Office was "basically uncooperative."
"I think Gellers was so controversial to certain segments of the population that they tried to entrap him," Curtis says.
In another strange incident a few days after the sting, Gellers' friend and co-defendant Al Cox -- free on bail -- stepped out of Gellers' house to allegedly discover Danny Bassett and his nephew Anthony "Pluto" Stanley slashing the upholstery in the attorney's car and pouring sugar into the gas tank. When Gellers tried to press charges, he says the Attorney General's Office sent Detective Hall -- who was based in York County -- to act as a "special investigator" on the complaint. Stanley admitted he and Bassett were guilty -- Gellers says -- but Hall refused to believe his signed affidavit and the court in Calais refused to issue a complaint. (Hall today says he doesn't recall the incident.)
That law enforcement was working to get rid of an unpopular attorney seemed clear. The events that followed would also put the courts in an unfavorable light.

Full text:   Several areas of the Maine coast have been closed to shellfish harvesting because of a mild red tide bloom, but soft-shell clams in the state's most productive and lucrative areas are unaffected.
Some of the clam flats from South Berwick to Harpswell were shut down June 12 to soft-shell clam harvesting, but the Scarborough-Biddeford basin and Casco Bay, including the important Freeport and Brunswick flats, were not affected, said Kohl Kanwit, director of the Bureau of Health for the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Several Harpswell flats -- and the clam diggers who depend on them -- have been affected, she said.
A separate closure bars the harvesting of mussels, European oysters, and surf or hen clams all the way to Stockton Springs, Deer Isle and Stonington.
Red tide occurs when a particular species of phytoplankton blooms, resulting in a large release of a neurotoxin. Red tide does not discolor the water or affect people by itself, but it can become concentrated when ingested by shellfish, which are filter feeders.
Eating shellfish affected by red tide can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP.
Symptoms include numbness in the mouth, face and limbs and, in serious cases, hospitalization or death from respiratory failure.
That's why the state tests extensively for the toxin before allowing areas to be open for soft-shell clam harvesting, Kanwit said.
Some areas have been closed to fishing for other kinds of shellfish, such as mussels, because the state does not have resources to test all the areas where they can be found. Different shellfish also are affected differently by the presence of the toxins.
"Usually the first thing to close is mussels, then hard clams; then they close oysters," said Lt. Rene Cloutier, of the Maine Marine Patrol, which is in charge of enforcing the shellfish closures. "Soft-shell clams, they're the biggest part of the industry. They won't filter as much. They're out of the water eight hours of the day because of the tides."
Last year was a mild year for red tide, Kanwit said, and so far this year also has been relatively mild. Kanwit said she expects that the closure for soft-shell clams could be lifted by next week.
"We're gearing up to see if it impacts eastern Maine. If it hits Down East Maine, depending on how severe, that could be extensive," she said. "So far it's not extensive."
Biologists so far have been unable to predict the large algal blooms that cause red tide, Kanwit said.
Red tide is primarily a problem in New England.
It also occurs in Florida, where toxins become airborne and can irritate people's respiratory system, but it is a different kind of organism, Kanwit said.

Full text:   Every day, we hear more evidence that changes in the global climate are real and threatening: New examples of extreme weather, the alarming rate of species extinction, and the melting of the West Arctic Ice Sheet that could result in a sea level rise of 12 feet by 2100.
Some changes feel more immediate and close to home: Ocean acidification that threatens our shellfish industry (studies by the University of Maine suggest that the juvenile lobster population has fallen by more than half since 2007), an increase in ticks that suck the life blood from the state's moose and temperature spikes that increase the risk of asthma and stroke.
One has to be willfully blind to deny the evidence shown us by thousands of scientist across the globe, but we do not have to passively shrug our shoulders and let the worst happen.
There are two main culprits in the United States that emit the greenhouse gases driving these changes in our oceans and atmosphere: automobiles and power plants.
Fortunately, the Obama administration is more enlightened about environmental issues than is ours here in Maine. Obama already has issued orders to reduce auto emissions and has announced a major initiative to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants.
The rules are flexible regarding how the reduction can be achieved, such as reducing consumer demand, investing in carbon-free generation, and developing carbon capture and storage techniques. Even one of the worst polluters in the country admits that it can install equipment that will enable it to comply with environmental regulations without passing the cost on to consumers (newspaper, "Polluter survives coal war," May 29).
I urge others to join with me in urging Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King to support these carbon dioxide emission standards for existing power plants.

Abstract: The trial, expected to last four weeks in U.S. District Court, comes just a month after state officials issued an order banning lobster and crab harvesting for at least the next two years and two months after the state's high court ruled that the company, Mallinckrodt US, had to carry out an estimated $130 million cleanup on the site of the former HoltraChem Manufacturing Co. While the state case focused on the contaminated land where the plant once stood, the federal lawsuit that was first brought against Mallinckrodt in 2000 by the citizens group Maine People's Alliance and the environmental action group Natural Resources Defense Council focuses on cleaning up the contamination.

Full text:   A trial in federal court in Bangor beginning Tuesday will decide whether a chemical company responsible for dumping mercury from a now-closed plant in Orrington will be required to clean up the contamination that still remains decades later along the banks of the Penobscot River and the mouth of the Penobscot Bay.
The trial, expected to last four weeks in U.S. District Court, comes just a month after state officials issued an order banning lobster and crab harvesting for at least the next two years and two months after the state's high court ruled that the company, Mallinckrodt US, had to carry out an estimated $130 million cleanup on the site of the former HoltraChem Manufacturing Co.
While the state case focused on the contaminated land where the plant once stood, the federal lawsuit that was first brought against Mallinckrodt in 2000 by the citizens group Maine People's Alliance and the environmental action group Natural Resources Defense Council focuses on cleaning up the contamination.
Though the HoltraChem plant has been closed since 2000, a scientific study ordered by the federal court found last year that enough mercury contamination remains in the soil along the banks of the river and in fish and plants north of Fort Point in the bay that the state ordered the two-year ban on lobster and crab harvesting.
The contamination spread far enough into the estuaries along the river that scientists working for the federal court sought special permission to notify state officials in 2011 about dangerously high mercury levels found in black ducks, according to court records. The state responded by issuing a consumer warning and posting signs in Mendall Marsh telling women and children to avoid eating waterfowl from the area altogether and for all others to limit how much they eat.
The Natural Resources Defense Council said in a pre-trial brief submitted in federal court last week that scientific studies show that although the plant dumped the vast majority of the mercury when it first opened in 1967 and into the 1970s, it could still take another 60 or more years for the contamination to dissipate without intervention.
"Prior to the closure, unsuspecting commercial fishermen caught lobsters and crabs from the Upper Estuary and sold them to unwitting consumers every day of the fishing season. Some, like Kenneth Wyman, a 26-year veteran of Maine's lobster trade, fed their families -- including pregnant women and young children -- regular meals of tainted shellfish," the NRDC's lead attorney, Mitchell Bernard, argued in the 28-page pre-trial brief.
The NRDC is asking the judge to rule that the level of contamination is too harmful to remain untreated and order Mallinckrodt to pay for ongoing mercury studies, testing and future remediation that could include dredging, capping or introducing oxygen or nutrients to prevent harmful effects of mercury.
Tuesday's trial is the second in the federal case. A different judge, who is now retired, found in the first trial in 2002 that Mallinckrodt is liable for the mercury contamination and ordered a study panel of scientists to be formed to oversee an investigation from 2005 to 2013. Mallinckrodt was also ordered to pay for that investigation.
Mallinckrodt, a St. Louis-based pharmaceutical company that inherited responsibility for HoltraChem after HoltraChem went bankrupt and dissolved in 2001, contends that it will show at trial that the Penobscot River system is less contaminated and is recovering faster than the team of scientists suggest in their final 2013 report. The company also argued in its pre-trial court filing that some remediation options could cause "more harm than good."
"Mercury in the river is not posing an unacceptable risk to human health, nor is it causing significantly adverse effects on populations of organisms. In the absence of any actual harm, elaborate further studies and pilot tests on speculative remedies are unnecessary," Mallinckrodt's attorney, Jeffrey Talbert, wrote in his 27-page pre-trial brief.
Mallinckrodt is a subsidiary of global healthcare products company Covidien, which also said it believes smaller-scale remediation efforts may be more appropriate.
"It is premature to speculate on the outcome of the trial," Covidien's spokeswoman, Lisa Clemence, said in an email Friday. "The court will hear the evidence and make a ruling based on that evidence and the law governing this matter. Mallinckrodt does not believe large scale remediation is necessary; however, the company has developed a proposal for certain limited studies and a proposal for monitoring some wildlife species, including but not limited to, certain fish and birds."
The Maine People's Alliance, which has allowed the NRDC to take the lead role in litigating the case against Mallinckrodt, said on Friday that it plans to hold a rally on the steps of the federal courthouse in Bangor at 8 a.m. before the trial starts on Tuesday.
The MPA's executive director, Jesse Graham, said it "wants Mallinckrodt to make it right."
"We want the mercury contamination removed, we want our river restored and we want to once again feel safe fishing for and eating the lobster and other seafood in that region," Graham said. "And that means we need the corporation that has been found responsible for the pollution to be held accountable for cleaning it up. This shouldn't be the taxpayers' burden."
Bernard, the NRDC's lead attorney, declined to comment on the case beyond what he said in his pre-trial legal filings. But Nancy Marks, another member of the litigation team, issued a statement on the group's behalf.
"This case is about two things. On the most immediate level, it's about securing an effective and environmentally sound cleanup for this iconic River, which is saturated with toxic mercury. The cleanup is for the people who look to the River for healthy food, for their livelihood, for recreation, and for spiritual sustenance. The cleanup is also for the imperiled birds, fish, and wildlife that populate the River's shores and waters," Marks said in the written statement. "On another level, this case is about corporate responsibility. Mallinckrodt made a profit while poisoning the Penobscot with mercury, endangering public health and the environment. For over forty years, the burdens of that contamination have been borne by Maine communities. Both federal law and principles of fairness demand that Mallinckrodt shoulder the burden now for cleaning up its pollution."
Between 25 and 30 witnesses are expected to be called during the trial, and much of the evidence will likely focus on the eight-year investigation overseen by the panel of scientists.

Full text:   MY DAD WOULD absolutely kill me if he knew about this.
Unless you're my father, you're probably not reading this on the edge of your seat wondering what I'm about to confess -- in a newspaper, no less -- to doing last weekend.
It was Saturday night of Memorial Day weekend, and I was perched at a high-top table on the balcony of a bar/restaurant in Bar Harbor.
My buddy Todd and I had just been brought our food, which was intended less for nutritional value and more to provide something of a sturdy foundation onto which we could pour one or two (or five) more beers.
Todd, an Arizona native I've known for a few years, looked at me over the top of his plate quizzically.
"What would he kill you for?"
I gestured to my own meal.
"This. I've got Maine lobster on top of a burger, barely visible under a pile of American cheese. And I'm about to put ketchup on it. Dad would be disgusted."
Now don't get me wrong. It's not that my old man doesn't like a burger, or a beer. But he'd be drafting the papers to disown me if he knew I was treating lobster with such reckless abandon.
When I was growing up in Australia, in a middle-class family, seafood was definitely a rare luxury. December falls in the first month of our summer, so at the Crawford family Christmas lunch there was more likely to be a great big bowl of cold cooked prawns on ice, and an equally sized bowl for the shells and heads.
It took me until I was probably in my early teens to acquire the taste for seafood, but once I was there, I was hooked (no pun intended). But despite that, prawns, oysters, scallops and bug -- what we call flathead lobster -- were reserved for special occasions.
Even on vacations over the last few years, my intake of the red crustacean has been restricted to the first weekend in September, when I help two buddies run a seafood festival down in Providence, R.I., where I get paid for three days of backbreaking labor with all the Narragansett I can drink, and lobster rolls.
But here I am now, living in a corner of the world whose No. 1 export by value in 2013 was lobster (there's so much of it, y'all are sending it away!), and suddenly what was an extremely rare, expensive treat is something I can go out and get for lunch every day, if I felt the urge.
Not only that, I'm slapping a couple of slices of cheese on the stuff and eating it on a burger. I could literally have had it on anything I wanted that night: It said right there on the menu that you could add lobster to any dish for $9. Sounds like a challenge to me.
The variety of food from region to region in the United States has always been one of the things I've loved about this country, and certainly one of my thinly veiled excuses for coming back so many times on vacation, and wanting to travel to so many places.
I'm a bottomless pit when it comes to Mexican food, so California and even places in southern Colorado hold a place in my heart -- and stomach. The South and the Midwest each accommodate my beer-drinker's palate for deep-fried goodness, I can see the beauty in both New York- and Chicago-style pizza, and I've had barbecue in more different places than I can count.
Since food is such a universal thing, but also differs so greatly, one thing people inevitably ask me about when they're getting to know me is, "What's the food like Down Under? Is it different? Was it hard to get used to American food?" Amusingly, in 2008, the mother of a girl I ended up dating for a couple of years asked me whether we "have pizza in Australia." Her daughter, who had studied abroad in my country the year before, was absolutely mortified.
In case you were wondering, yes we do have pizza back home, and the cuisine isn't altogether that different. We have more Asian and English influences, through geographical location and heritage, respectively, but all in all it's reasonably similar. In my humble opinion, anyway.
I recently joined a Facebook group called "Australians in America," more out of sheer morbid curiosity than to connect with fellow expatriates. And while there are some interesting topics of conversation (and a considerable amount of complaining about how the U.S. isn't like Australia -- go figure), a lot of it seems to be about "foods you miss from home," and it's like an echo chamber. Beer brands, Cherry Ripe and Picnic ("Deliciously Ugly") candy bars, meat pies and sausage rolls.
Every few weeks I'll get a text from my mother or sister, asking whether there's anything I want in a care package from home. The latter relative sent me a huge box around Christmas that was brimming with Tim Tams -- Australia's most desired hybrid cookie/candy bar thing -- as well as chips and other odds and ends. But when I've received subsequent deliveries of Tim Tams, I squirrel away a couple for myself and take the rest to the office for my coworkers, under the premise that they're low in calories because of the metric system, or something. I'd wager, though, that if I brought in a jar of Vegemite, it would be consumed with a lot less fervor.
I don't know whether it's because I haven't been away from Australia for long -- I celebrated six months as an American permanent resident last Sunday, as a matter of fact -- but there's just not all that many consumables I miss that can't be replicated here.
There's a great Maine soda company that makes a non-alcoholic ginger beer very similar to an excellent one made in my home state of Queensland, and if I can get chips flavored like chicken and waffles, do I really yearn for a variety I can only get back home?
I know there'll come a time -- probably in the height of summer -- when I'll crave a cold beer and a sausage roll one Sunday afternoon. But until then, I'm perfectly content to make do with lobstah.

Full text:   MY DAD WOULD absolutely kill me if he knew about this.
Unless you're my father, you're probably not reading this on the edge of your seat wondering what I'm about to confess -- in a newspaper, no less -- to doing last weekend.
It was Saturday night of Memorial Day weekend, and I was perched at a high-top table on the balcony of a bar/restaurant in Bar Harbor.
My buddy Todd and I had just been brought our food, which was intended less for nutritional value and more to provide something of a sturdy foundation onto which we could pour one or two (or five) more beers.
Todd, an Arizona native I've known for a few years, looked at me over the top of his plate quizzically.
"What would he kill you for?"
I gestured to my own meal.
"This. I've got Maine lobster on top of a burger, barely visible under a pile of American cheese. And I'm about to put ketchup on it. Dad would be disgusted."
Now don't get me wrong. It's not that my old man doesn't like a burger, or a beer. But he'd be drafting the papers to disown me if he knew I was treating lobster with such reckless abandon.

Full text:   Consumers aim to support local economy, know history of food from farm stand to fish market
CAPE ELIZABETH -- Mainers have a hearty appetite for local food, but a new survey has found many barriers still prevent them from tossing Maine-grown items into their shopping baskets.
In a survey of food-buying habits, nearly 80 percent of Maine consumers said they prefer purchasing their produce, meat and fish locally, primarily because they want to support their farmers, fishermen and community businesses.
Despite a strong affinity for eating local, the survey found the local food movement still has plenty of room to grow -- and there are things producers can do to make it easier for shoppers to choose Maine foods, particularly when it comes to buying fish.
Marketing strategies such as labeling foods clearly as Maine-grown or -raised, telling the stories behind the products, and providing information on preparation and cooking would make local food more accessible to the public, according to Maine Food Strategy steering committee members who released the survey Monday in front of the Jordan's Farm produce stand.
"The primary reason people buy local foods is to help the local economy," said Mark Dvorozniak of Marketing Strategy Decisions, who is a member of the committee. "But it's the direct communication with farmers and fishermen that's really important."
Maine Food Strategy is a nonprofit organization that is trying to strengthen the food network in Maine. Their statewide telephone survey of nearly 600 households, conducted by the University of Southern Maine Muskie School of Public Service, found that 58 percent of Mainers spend more than $50 on local food in a typical month.
Overall, Mainers cited freshness, flavor and nutrition as top concerns when considering what goes on their shopping lists. Those were followed by cost and whether the animals providing meat for their tables were raised humanely. Consumers also showed a preference for food that is antibiotic and hormone-free.
Mainers overwhelmingly reported doing most of their shopping at chain grocery stores, but more than 56 percent said they also buy food at a farmers market or farm stand.
In a first for Maine, the survey asked people about their gardening, hunting, fishing and foraging habits.
"We found that a little more than a third of households produce some of their own food," said Tanya Swain, co-director of Maine Food Strategy, "and of the ones that are doing this, about 70 percent plan to do the same or more this year."
While two-thirds of the consumers surveyed said they had bought fish, seafood or shellfish in the last month, only 47 percent bought fish from Maine waters, said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association and a member of the Maine Food Strategy steering committee.
"Fishermen historically have been left out of this conversation, and it's time we start talking about seafood and putting it back on the table for our local consumers," he said. "While many consumers don't think about seafood when they're looking to buy local, the state of Maine has a fantastic fleet of boats that sustainably target a wide variety of fish and shellfish that are landed up and down the coast."
One of the reasons people gave for not buying more Maine fish is because it's not clear where the fish in the seafood case comes from, suggesting that labeling would be a good idea, Martens said.
"We need to do a better job of highlighting and labeling our products," he said. "We've not done a good enough job in answering the questions as to what to buy, where to get it and even how to cook it."
Overall, Dvorozniak said, the report "confirms the demand for local foods and provides insight for businesses to grow."
He said producers and retailers need to broaden the variety and availability of local food, offer quality at a reasonable price and educate consumers with recipes and serving suggestions. Businesses should emphasize the specific geographic source of foods and the environmental conditions in which they were raised, to reinforce the freshness factor.
"People in Maine and all across the globe want to know the source, and more importantly, the story behind their food," Dvorozniak said. "And boy, do we have stories here in Maine -- authentic stories, both old and new."
Hanne Tierney, who raises vegetables and pastured pork at Cornerstone Farm in Palmyra, said she often shares such stories with her customers.
"All through the farmers market, people come up to me and say, 'Tell me about your sausage,'" she said. "They aren't asking what types of sausage I have. They want to hear that the pig was bred, born and raised right on my farm and that I didn't use any antibiotics or growth hormones or animal byproducts or any of those things."
While she welcomes such interaction, she thinks they may be the equivalent of preaching to the choir.
"I'm not sure we're reaching the part of the population that isn't as concerned where their food comes from," she said.
John Bott, spokesman for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, said the results of the survey are "consistent with what we've found" when it comes to the need for building stronger connections between consumers and producers.
Working toward that goal, the state's getrealmaine.com website developed the first searchable database of farmers markets online.
Most recently, the department came up with a way for consumers to connect with farmers right in the grocery store. The project, now being developed further by the Maine Farm Bureau, allows consumers to scan the product code on a bunch of carrots and then see a brief description of the place the carrots were grown and hear their story straight from the farmer in a minutelong video.
"We're clearly optimistic that there's even more that can be done in Maine to link consumers with local Maine food and products," he said.
The Maine Food Strategy group will be sharing key findings of the survey in briefings held around the state throughout the summer.
The meetings will be held June 26 at the St. Mary's Nutrition Center in Lewiston and the Good Food Council of Lewiston-Auburn; July 8 on at Coastal Enterprises, Inc. in Portland; and July 16 at Aroostook Partnership for Progress in Caribou.
Registration details will be posted at mainefoodstrategy.org.

Full text:   diversity of vegetables
Maine farmers are diversifying their crops to meet the demands of customers who are passionate about eating locally and increasingly savvy in the kitchen. That's what the 2012 census data released Friday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture seem to show, according to state agriculture leaders.
Maine farmers are growing more trendy foods, sometimes responding to the menu requirements at farm-to-table restaurants and sometimes driving them. When the last census was completed, in 2007, kale was grown over a total of just two acres in Maine, on 10 farms, though the greens are well-suited to the Maine climate. Five years and a green smoothie craze later, 53 farms grew kale over 16 acres.
The number of pigs and hogs being raised in Maine more than doubled to 8,923, despite high grain prices.
"You get bragging rights in Portland if you can source your foods locally," said Agriculture Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. "So the value of those animals has gone up. There's an incentive now, and we certainly look to that to continue to grow."
Maine has bucked the broader trend in farming. The number of farms in the United States declined by 4 percent between 2007 and 2012. In Maine, the number increase slightly to 8,174. The market value of Maine's agricultural products increased 24 percent to more than $763 million in 2013.
The local food movement has helped, Whitcomb said. "I think it is kind of a push-pull with the exponential growth in farmers markets and the growth in the number of farms that participate in" community-supported agriculture programs, in which customers typically buy a share of the harvest directly from the farm.
In 2007, Maine had about 63 farmers markets. By 2012, that number was up to approximately 100. Today there are about 135 markets, although that number includes winter markets that might be considered duplicative.
For farmers like Stacy Brenner who has been farming for 13 years, eight of them at Broadturn Farm in Scarborough, diversification has always been key. She and her husband grow flowers and about 120 varieties of vegetables. "Anything we can get to grow in Maine," she said. "And people seem to be more open to leafy greens, more open generally to a variety of vegetables."
Her typical customer has a Vitamix blender at home and is looking for kale and spinach for the health-conscious smoothie. Broadturn has a farmstand in Scarborough, another at Aurora Provisions in Portland and runs a farm share program. She pushes her customers to try new things, but she also learns from their restaurant experiences.
"Brussel sprouts are all the rage now," she said.
Broadturn Farm also grows potatoes, another crop that has seen an interesting transition since the 2007 census, when there were 464 farms growing potatoes in Maine. In 2012, there were 741, but the total acreage didn't go up all that much. That's because competition with Western growers has cut into the Maine potato's marketability, Whitcomb said. As a result, some potato fields have been turned over to hayland, primarily for feeding horses.
But more growers are adding parcels of potatoes here and there for sale on the fresh market. And not just at farmers market stands.
"A lot of these mid-sized Maine growers are supplying the Hannafords and the Market Baskets and the Walmarts," Whitcomb said.
The census data marks other significant shifts on Maine farms. Farmers added irrigation systems on nearly 10,000 acres of farmland, an increase of 47 percent. In 2012, 386 farmers were growing greenhouses, up from 125 in 2007.
Whitcomb said he'll be mining the Farm Census for months to come as he makes his way from one speaking engagement to another. The positive trends he sees in the report include a big boost in aquaculture, with the value of sales increasing by 185 percent, up to $75 million, much of it in farmed oysters and mussels.
There are more maple producers in Maine now than in 2007, up 10 percent to 517, and 27 percent more trees are being tapped.
"It's kind of a fun thing to do of course, but there is also a growing level of sophistication to these operations," Whitcomb said. "It's not just putting out four buckets on the trees in the yard. It's 80,000 taps in one of the operations near the Canadian border."
Another area of growth, with still-untapped potential, Whitcomb said, is agri-tourism. That's a wide ranging category of farm activities, including apple picking, cheese tastings, hay rides and corn mazes. Income to Maine farms from agri-tourism was up 78 percent in the five year period, with $1.8 million in agri-tourism sales in 2012.
"We see positive trends around the state and it's nice when the numbers help us verify that it is true," Whitcomb said.

Full text:   The Sustain Mid Maine Coalition held its fifth annual meeting on Jan. 25, celebrating five years of work by volunteers trying to reduce consumption of fossil fuels and prevent the worst effects of global climate change because too much carbon dioxide is being put into the air.
We already have exceeded 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the air, which was the target that many scientists told us to try to avoid.
Many have been aware of global climate change for many years. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol, sponsored by the United Nations, recommended that all nations greatly reduce generation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In 2005, many of us viewed or read "An Inconvenient Truth," Al Gore's movie and book.
The ice caps and glaciers are melting, which will increase the level of the ocean several feet, flood the world's coastlines and make many structures unusable.
The ocean is also turning more acidic. As this continues, many kinds of fish, shellfish and underwater vegetation will no longer be able to survive.
Weather is changing, as evidenced by such vicious storms as Hurricane Katrina and superstorm Sandy that hit New York City and New Jersey last year. Rainstorms put more stormwater into our road drainage systems, causing severe damage to our public road systems, as happened recently in Vermont.
Much less rain is falling in the southwestern United States, where limits are set about how much water can be used in urban areas and to irrigate agricultural fields.
These changes are being observed in many parts of the world, although parts of the world farther from the equator should continue to have enough rain.
To open the Sustain Mid Maine annual meeting, I recited the following invocation.
"Let us pray for fairness.
"Let us remember that the most basic human instinct is for survival, as it is for other forms of life. For survival, we need to be able to breathe clean air, drink clean water, eat healthy food and live in a climate that is not too cold or too hot. All creatures need this. We need this not only for today, next week, next month and next year, but for ever and a day. Our children and our grandchildren need this.
"The world will be more fair if all people everywhere and forever are able to have this. Help us contribute to making the world a fair and healthy place for all people.
"Help us plan ahead for a strong economy in which all people have an opportunity to have clean air, drink clean water, eat healthy food and live in a climate that is not too cold or too hot.
"Help us plan together, and implement plans together, to avert the most terrible effects of global climate change before it is too late. It is already too late to prevent some of the effects of climate change from happening. Help us plan and adjust to the changes in our way of life that will be needed to survive.
"Help us find ways to obtain the energy we need without consumption of the fossil fuels that are causing global climate change. Help us to understand that the true cost of fossil fuel, when including the cost of the damage that fossil fuel does to our actual economy, including the environment, is really more expensive than alternative sources of energy.
"Please, help us to define and implement the best, most fair, ways to achieve a sustainable future for all people around the world."
We all need to work together, aggressively, in order to survive.
On April 22, we will observe Earth Day 2014, a day when we all should take time to consider and celebrate the good things about the environment in which we live.
We do have cleaner water and air than we had at the time of the first Earth Day in 1970. At that time, most people supported the need for laws to provide us with a more healthy environment. This year, let us all think about the things that still are needed to ensure that we and our children will have a healthy place to live here on Earth.

Full text:   "It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change."
-- Charles Darwin
This has to be an enormously frustrating time for scientists, particularly for those who work in climate, vaccinations and evolution. Despite hundreds of millions of hours of research and testing, large segments of the public continue to ignore their voices, encouraged by those who seem to gleefully embrace the virtues of ignorance over "elitist" science.
Scientists have been warning us about climate change since the 1970s, with articles, seminars and research papers signed by hundreds of top scientists. They have been as clear as scientific integrity allows: Without significant changes in our reliance on dirty fuels, we and our children will face incomprehensible consequences to our environment, weather, food, health and security.
Last week, 772 of the world's most accomplished climate scientists issued an SOS to the world, through the United Nations, warning about the spread of disease, extreme weather, sea level rise, property losses, threats to the food chain and increasing political instability.
The response to decades of these warnings has been multi-faceted. Industry-funded "movements" have sprung up to undermine science. Vest-pocket scientists have been hired to turn every small unknown into an indictment. Conservative activists and politicians, eager to embrace any argument against government, have been actively enlisted and duly rewarded. Meaningful action has ground to a halt.
But climate change doesn't care much about politics, and it is accelerating now at a rate that is faster than scientists projected a decade ago.
Today, public attitudes about climate change are shifting as more people see unusual events, around the world and here. USA Today and Stanford polling in December showed that 71 percent say that can see the effects of global warming.
Gallup this week reported that 57 percent of Americans now believe that climate change is caused by human behavior.
Meanwhile, an analysis of climate polling shows majority support in every state -- red or blue -- for offering incentives for solar, wind and water power and limiting greenhouse gases from businesses and power plants.
What is happening with public attitudes about climate change follows a familiar arc that other transformative debates have taken. First comes a long period of discussion, learning, reflection and resistance. Support grows slowly and then accelerates to a tipping point.
Examples abound, ranging from the end of apartheid in South Africa to the fall of the Soviet Union and in the sudden overthrow of dictatorships across the globe. We've seen that same progression in America with shifts in public attitudes about race, women, gays and the environment.
Each of those changes simmered quietly over a long period, then heated up and finally and suddenly boiled over. In the end, the rapidity of change after a tipping point was reached has invariably surprised people.
Who in the 20th century, for instance, anticipated a black president? Who imagined that the leading candidate for president today would be a woman? Who foresaw the sudden acceptance of gay marriage? All seemed impossible until they weren't.
When I was growing up along the banks of the Kennebec River in Waterville, some things were thought to be forever unchanging. Among them were a stinking, Technicolor river, ashtrays in every home, high rates of cancer in almost every family and roadsides littered with trash.
We had a big conversation about all of those things, not unlike the one we're having now about climate. People offered dire warnings, both for and against change. Groups formed to protect industry or the rest of us. Then change happened.
Today, people fish and swim in the river, returnable bottles are in our garages rather than on the roadsides and ashtrays are more common in antique stores than living rooms.
The tipping point on climate is approaching, not because scientists are becoming better communicators, but because people are seeing climate change both in their backyards and the daily news.
Growing seasons are changing. New birds and animals are at the feeders or in the garden. Cod and lobsters are migrating offshore and northward to cooler waters.
Increasing acidity and warming water are weakening shellfish and expanding the range of invasive species such as green crabs.
The climate change conversation is broadening from the educated elites to the people who work with their hands every day. And that, more than anything else, tells us that a tipping point is fast approaching.

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- Sable, an 8-year-old shepherd mix adopted from an animal shelter, has a nose for sniffing out trouble.
Sable's nose that knows has taken the dog and its handler, Scott Reynolds, co-owner of Environmental Canine Services, across the country, sniffing out human sewage in water where it doesn't belong. The dog is more efficient and effective than traditional, human-dependent methods, helping communities clean up their lakes, rivers and beaches.
On Tuesday, the pair were at the Maine Water and Sustainability Conference at the Augusta Civic Center. Reynolds explained the dog's sniffing skills and how they are used. Several hundred people who work with or are interested in water resources and environmental sustainability attended the conference.
"He's a human-sewage-detecting dog," said Reynolds, of Michigan, who is starting a branch of his business in the Portsmouth, N.H., area to serve the Northeast. "He's a lot faster than traditional methods."
When he's not working, Sable enjoys snuggling on the couch, howling with coyotes, sleeping and barking at cats, but he's always ready and excited to work. Reynolds said Sable loves sniffing out human waste so much he is disappointed when, as was the case Tuesday, his green work vest is placed on him but they go to a speaking engagement, not a sniffing assignment. Reynolds believes Environmental Canine Services is the only such service in the country.
Sable and his co-worker, Logan, a collie mix, track down human waste, which is helpful when human sources of bacteria are hurting water quality, but it's not known where the human waste is coming from. They search out human waste specifically and signal when they find it. Sable barks; Logan sits.
They help sniff out leaks from sewer systems into stormwater systems and from septic systems into water bodies.
Reynolds said more traditional methods of finding bacteria sources rely on sending potentially contaminated soils to a laboratory, which takes at least 24 hours to test the samples and even then can't always tell whether the waste that was the source of the bacteria was human or animal.
Reynolds said Sable has been working as a sniffer for five or six years. He said training him took about a year using methods similar to those used to train bomb- or drug-sniffing dogs.
In Maine, the dogs and Reynolds have worked in Portland and Kittery working with FB Environmental, which has offices in Portland and Portsmouth.
Reynolds and Sable were among the more popular vendors at Tuesday's conference, which organizers said has grown to become one of the largest environment-related conferences in Maine.
This year the conference, founded in 1994 by the Senator George J. Mitchell Center at the University of Maine as the Maine Water Conference, added "Sustainability" to its name and focus, reflecting its broader mission. "Water problems are never just water problems," Mitchell Center Director David Hart said in explaining why sustainability was added to the conference title and focus. "If we hope to solve these problems, you have to look at water and many other things."
Conference session topics included the effect of water withdrawals on water supply and quality, lake management strategies, Maine's energy future, climate-related trends, safe beaches and shellfish beds, and management approaches for sustainable urban streams.
Robert Kates, a senior research associate at Harvard University and professor of sustainability science at the University of Maine, described how the science of sustainability can lead to action that is good for both the environment and society. Kates, a winner of the National Medal of Science, said knowledge can result in action when those involved take four steps: identify a problem, create knowledge about the problem, find a solution and take action.
Kates, who is studying climate change and the vulnerability of culverts not designed to handle the amount of water flow from major storms testing them now, said a recent survey of town managers indicated culverts were at the top of the list of things they thought their towns would need help adapting to climate change.
He said large storms that historically occurred once every 100 years, the yardstick used between 1950 and 1979, now occur more often, at an interval of once every 60 years.
Kates said tools including rain mapping and other scientific data can be used to plan what size culverts could be needed in a spot for the next 50 years.
Mark Borsuk, associate professor in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, spoke on "Gambling with the Globe: The Role of Risk in Decision-Making for Sustainability."
Borsuk said scientists should include the risks associated with climate change as they report on the issue, so people, most of whom are naturally risk-averse, understand what's at stake if they decide to do nothing about a problem.
He said most people recognize the risks of climate change, yet policymakers are reluctant to take action to address climate change because of its complexity and uncertainty.
He said protecting against severe consequences is a basic principle of sustainability, and if there is a risk of such consequences, if people are aware of those risks, they will be more likely to take action or precautionary measures -- even in the face of uncertainty about those consequences. Borsuk noted there will always be some level of uncertainty in models trying to predict the future of the climate.
Borsuk used a Yogi Berra quote to help explain: "It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."

1933-2014
HALLOWELL -- Polly Anne Hayes Laflin, of Hallowell, passed away on Tuesday, March 18, 2014, surrounded by her large, loving family after a battle with cancer. She was 81. She is survived by her husband Richard and her four children.
Polly was born March 4, 1933, in Hallowell, to James K. Hayes and Arlene Smith Hayes. She was a graduate of Hallowell High's class of 1951, where her nickname was Phoebe and was very active in social and athletic events. She at that time also collected china horses. After graduation she and her high school sweetheart Richard took off for Washington, D.C., where she worked as a clerk/typist for the federal government. The two returned to Hallowell in the fall to be married and returned home for good the next year to start raising their family. She often enlisted her young children to help build her rock gardens and also did some bottle collecting with them. For 62 years, Polly was a dedicated wife as well as a matriarch and mentor to her extended family. The family moved to "the farm" which had been in Richard's family since 1925 and began decades of bird watching and growing vegetables. Polly froze and canned dozens of quarts of vegetables for the winter, and her raspberry jam was highly prized by friends and family.
She was affiliated with the St. Mathew's Church in Hallowell and a member of the former St. Mathew's Women's Guild. She enjoyed being a member of a bowling team at Jerry Brook Lanes and, when at home, was skilled at finishing jigsaw and crossword puzzles. She was an avid reader and particularly enjoyed books by John Grisham. Other indoor activities included a draw poker game and watching the birds flock to the many feeders right outside the picture window. When spring arrived, however, she and Richard looked forward to an annual fishing trip to Square Lake with the Parmenters, the Sylvesters and, in later years, they were joined by the "Mass" group (from Massachusetts). And, by the way, Wayne, Polly did, in the end, forgive you for the bear scare -- a prank in which he used a bear suit to frighten her. Polly also treasured her annual two-week trip to Port Clyde with Gloria Small, her best friend since 1952 when they were just teenagers. In that beautiful special place, they could relax, read and reminisce over their shared lifetime experiences.
Polly made the farm a true open house for all -- whether for a visit, a drink, a meal or an overnight stay. She loved cooking and baking for family and friends and was happy to offer whatever she had to whomever showed up. She herself favored seafood, especially oyster stew.
Polly never missed a Red Sox game on television and in 2007, her oldest son Mike took her to her first game at Fenway Park. After her death, the ticket stubs from that game were found still in her wallet.
Polly is survived by her husband Richard C. Laflin, of Hallowell, and their children: son Michael Laflin, of Hallowell, and his sons, Nick, of Maupin, Ore., and Nate and his wife, Kirsten, and their daughter Ava, of Farmingdale; daughter Kathy Harrington, of Hallowell, her son Paul and his daughter, Melody, of Hallowell, son Bill and his son, Dustin, of Hallowell; son Rodney Laflin and his wife, Sandra, of Gardiner, their daughters Jessica, of Randolph, Angela and her fiance, Adam St. Jarre, and their son, Tucker, of Clinton, Sandra's son Jeff True, of Monmouth; and son Daniel Laflin and his partner, Rose Bilodeau, of Hallowell, his daughter Megan, of Montreal, and his son Jake, of Hallowell.
Polly's siblings who survive her: Ken Hayes and his wife, Marjorie, of Idaho, Martha Pollard, of North Carolina; and her sister-in-law Gerry Shipley, of Middleton, Mass. Polly is also survived by her cousin Dick Hayes and his wife, Jean, of Hallowell, and numerous nieces and nephews.
She will be greatly missed by her faithful black Lab Buddy. Polly was predeceased by her daughter Pamela J. Laflin and her daughter-in-law Debra A. Laflin. The family would like to say a special thank-you to Polly's Hospice team and to the wonderful friends, neighbors and family who supported and loved her through her courageous battle.
At her request, there will be no formal service, but a celebration of Polly's life will be held in May at the family farm in Hallowell. Donations may be made to the Humane Society Waterville Area, 100 Webb Road, Waterville, ME 04901.
Arrangements are under the care of Plummer Funeral Home, 16 Pleasant St., Augusta, ME. Condolences, photos and memories may be shared at www.plummerfh.com.

Full text:   State Toxicologist Andrew Smith received an urgent message in 2011: A team of independent scientists had discovered dangerously high levels of mercury in black ducks in a marsh near the mouth of the Penobscot River.
What Smith didn't know was that the same scientists previously had conducted tests that showed similarly high levels of mercury from samplings in the same area of lobsters -- the source of the state's multimillion-dollar signature seafood industry -- and failed to report their findings.
It took nearly six years for that lobster information to become public.
The scientists had shared early test results from 2006 that showed slightly elevated mercury results in lobster, but neglected to inform state regulatory agencies about more alarming mercury findings gathered from detailed follow-up tests starting in 2008.
After state officials reviewed the full study, which was completed in 2013, they announced last month that a 7-square-mile area where the river meets Penobscot Bay would be closed to lobster and crab harvesting.
The scientists who wrote the report mistakenly believed that they had informed the state years ago about dangerous levels of mercury. State officials say their own testing done in the same region was too limited and did not detect any immediate threat in lobster.
But the fact that consumers in the lower Penobscot River area may have continued to eat lobster with high mercury levels for years after scientists learned of the threat represents a critical breakdown in communication between entities tasked with working to protect the public.
Now state officials are planning to change the way they conduct tests in the area, to gather many more samples in the now-known mercury hot spots over multiple seasons.
The vast majority of lobsters fished from Maine waters remain safe to eat. The closed area is only a small fraction of the more than 14,000 square miles in the Gulf of Maine where lobsters are harvested.
"I think the thing to remember is that the average level in even the closed area (is) not that much higher than canned white tuna," said Smith, director of the state's Environmental and Occupational Health Programs. "If we had issued an advisory, it would have been to limit your consumption to 3 to 4 ounces per week. That's in the closed area."
Smith said the overriding concern in closing the 7-square-mile area was for those who might catch lobsters recreationally, since they might fish over and over in the same area near the mouth of the Penobscot. Commercial lobstermen, by contrast, would tend to fish a region rather than just one area.
The independent team of scientists was formed in 2003 by order of a federal judge in Maine as a result of a lawsuit brought against the former HoltraChem Manufacturing Co. plant in Orrington. The chemical company had dumped tons of mercury waste directly into the Penobscot River starting in 1967 and later collected waste in landfills on the plant site before it closed in 2000.
The two groups that brought the federal suit, the Maine People's Alliance and Natural Resources Defense Council, won the first leg of their legal fight against the now-defunct HoltraChem and its inheritor, St. Louis-based Mallinckrodt Inc. After a 2002 trial in U.S. District Court in Bangor, a judge found that the chemical company could be held responsible for the costs of cleaning up mercury contamination in the Penobscot River and Penobscot Bay.
The team of scientists, called the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel, was charged with determining the extent of contamination in the watershed, the feasibility of restoring the body of water and whether the mercury posed an unacceptable health risk to people. The scope of their study included years of testing of sediments and wetland soils, numerous plants and a broad range of animals.
The team got its first results on mercury contamination in lobster in 2006 from samples collected south of Fort Point Cove and downriver from the area that was ultimately closed.
The results were limited, based on sample sizes of one to five lobsters taken from each of four test sites. The results showed that some, but not all, of the lobster meat had mercury concentrations exceeding 200 nanograms per gram of tissue, the threshold set by state and federal agencies as the level at which they would advise people to limit their consumption, according to court records.
The Maine People's Alliance shared the results from 2006 with state officials after the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel published them in its first 117-page report filed with the court in 2008. But the state took no immediate action while it awaited results from its own study.
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has advised that pregnant and nursing women and children younger than 8 eat no more than 8 ounces of fish per week, based on guidelines that estimate a safe level of consumption to be 200 nanograms of mercury per gram of meat. Two average-size lobsters yield about 8 ounces of meat.
Smith said he reviewed the 2006 data last month -- after the state decided to close the area at the mouth of the Penobscot River to lobster and crab harvesting for at least two years -- to see what he would have found if the data were presented to him today.
"We would have found they could eat about a meal, an 8-ounce meal, per week and we would not have issued an advisory," Smith said.
Mercury is toxic to humans and in high doses can attack neurological systems such as the brain, peripheral nerves, the pancreas, immune system and kidneys. Unborn children are especially sensitive to mercury's toxic effects, and excessive exposure can lead to mental disabilities, cerebral palsy and nervous system damage.
During that same 2006 time frame, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection was working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to collect its own samples of seven lobsters from the northern part of Penobscot Bay, including from the south end of Verona Island, an area that later was shown to be a hot spot for mercury contamination.
Jim Stahlnecker, a DEP biologist who oversees the state's marine monitoring program, said his office pays for testing of the lobsters' tomalley, the green substance in the body cavity that functions as a liver and pancreas, while the EPA funds testing on the meat of the lobsters.
"The mercury level is typically higher in the tomalley than it is in the muscle tissue," Stahlnecker said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been warning consumers since at least 2008 to avoid eating tomalley because of toxins that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, regardless of where the lobsters are caught, from South Carolina up the East Coast to eastern Canada.
So when the state got test results in 2007 showing mercury levels above 200 nanograms per gram in tomalley tissue, Stahlnecker said he wasn't surprised, but it made him curious to see the EPA's results for the lobster meat.
It took the EPA until 2010 to complete its portion of the laboratory testing, which found the sampled lobster had a mercury level of 137 nanograms per gram of lobster meat.
"That wasn't at the level where we would think about an advisory," Stahlnecker said. "That didn't raise a red flag."
While the state officials were still awaiting the EPA findings, the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel continued testing mercury levels in 2008 and 2009. It expanded its testing to eight sites, including north of Fort Point Cove, at Odom Ledge and off South Verona, where they found the highest mercury readings in lobster meat.
The study panel tested lobster meat differently from the DEP-EPA study, analyzing the claw and tail meat separately.
The 2008 tests found that claw meat rose above the 200-nanogram threshold only at the South Verona test site. None of the claw meat samples from the 2009 study rose above that threshold.
But tail meat samples showed higher mercury levels than claw meat, reaching about 475 nanograms per gram at the South Verona test site in 2008 and about 425 ng/g at the same site in 2009, according to the group's final report issued in 2013.
The panel was still collecting its 2010 samples when it called for a meeting with state and federal officials in September 2010.
A member of the three-scientist panel said last month that state officials found out at that 2010 meeting about mercury contamination in lobsters, but he later retracted the statement, saying he realized the panel had not released its 2008 and 2009 findings at the meeting.
Stacy Ladner, a DEP environmental specialist assigned to remediation of the former HoltraChem site, said she attended the 2010 meeting and recalled no presentation of lobster data. Up to that point, she had seen only the panel's 2008 study, which detailed its lobster data from 2006. A subsequent panel report in 2009 also contained no new lobster information.
The focus of the 2010 meeting, she said, was on gathering opinions on different approaches to cleaning up the mercury contamination.
"They wanted to throw out some ideas for remediation. They wanted to see if any of those were non-starters. That was the thrust," Ladner said.
The Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel did make a point of informing the state about at least one alarming finding while the study was still being conducted.
The panel made a special request in April 2011, asking for permission from the federal court to release a portion of its findings on black ducks before its final report was completed.
Researchers working for the panel had taken samples of black ducks during the hunting season in December 2010 and January 2011 from Mendall Marsh, finding that breast muscle tests showed the ducks had mercury levels at more than three times the state and federal threshold.
The panel shared that finding with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, prompting the state agency to issue a warning that pregnant women and children under 8 should not eat any waterfowl meat taken from that area and that all others should eat no more than two 8-ounce duck meat meals per month.
"Waterfowl taken from the immediate vicinity of Mendall Marsh and from Orrington south to the southern tip of Verona Island may contain high levels of mercury," the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said in its warning, which remains in effect today.
Smith said that while he was alerted to the black duck mercury threat, the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel made no such attempt to notify the state about high mercury levels in lobster.
The panel made no mention of its 2008, 2009 and 2010 findings in lobster until it issued its final report to the court in April 2013.
"My first involvement with the mercury data was in 2011, when we had black duck data coming at us," said Smith. "Nothing about lobster at that time."
Smith said he was first alerted in October 2013 that the panel's final report existed, but didn't see it until November. He then assembled a team that spent three months analyzing not only the panel's report but data from each year's findings that his team requested, as well as additional data from 2012 lobster tests that were completed in December 2013.
Ladner said she learned of the final report during the last week of April 2013, but was unable to get a usable copy from the court until June.
She said that she initially read only portions of the 1,800-page report to prepare for a conference call with the Natural Resources Defense Council about how the findings could be used to force Mallinckrodt to clean up the contaminated watershed.
"There was no mention of biology. It was all about remediation," Ladner said.
It took months for Ladner to get to other chapters of the study, and it wasn't until then that she realized the researchers had new data on lobster contamination beyond what had been found in 2006.
DEP officials are now working with the Department of Marine Resources to come up with a new way to test lobsters in the mercury hot spots that will carry on the testing done by the study panel -- testing claws and tails separately, from many samples from many test sites. They also plan to test over multiple seasons, rather than the peak summer months the study panel focused on.
"We want to make sure we fill in any data gaps," Smith said.

Gov. Paul LePage on Friday ordered the creation of a task force to study and combat the invasive European green crab, which fishermen along the coast have said is decimating shellfish populations.
Although the species has been reported in Maine since 1904, recent weather patterns and warming ocean temperatures appear to have allowed the tiny critters to multiply and move north, devouring blue mussels, soft- and hard-shell clams and coastal grasses.
The crabs have contributed to wetland erosion as well as depleted populations of spat, the tiny juvenile clams that are easy targets for the voracious species.
"Green crabs are threatening our state's $25 million bivalve shellfish industry, which is Maine's third most lucrative fishery," LePage said. "It's critical that we protect the fishery and the good jobs the industry supports."
The 12-member panel will include representatives from the state departments of Marine Resources, Environmental Protection, and Economic and Community Development, as well as towns with shellfish ordinances, representatives of the bivalve fishery and marine resource industry, and three researchers.
The task force will be charged with identifying the direct economic impact of the crabs on the shellfish industry; develop long-term eradication and control plans; and identify the cost of the crab-control strategies. A report is due by Sept. 30.
Brian Beal, a marine ecologist at the University of Maine who specializes in shellfish, struck a balance between optimism for the governor's recognition of the problem and the challenge that lies ahead for the task force members.
"It's going to be a lot of work to complete," said Beal, who was present during the governor's announcement at the annual Maine Fishermen's Forum in Rockport.
Beal said the regulatory environment is ripe for changes, and that a group of focused, creative professionals could come up with a creative solution that until now has been prevented by state-imposed limits on green crab fishing.
"How do you get rid of an invasive species? You fish 'em to death," Beal said. "We did an awful good job of reducing population of sea urchins without even trying."
Beal said reducing or eliminating catch and size limits imposed in 2000 would be a logical first step to reducing the green crab population.
Creating a viable economic market for the critters would be next, he said, either as fodder for compost and fertilizer, chicken feed, pet food or as a source for a medically valuable substance contained in the crabs' shells.
"I think if there's a price that fishermen will get for their effort that's economically doable, then I think the sky's the limit," he said.
But the challenge ahead is daunting, said Sara Randall, a spokeswoman for the Maine Clammers Association.
Randall said about 90 percent of the clam flats in Casco Bay are devoid of legally harvestable shellfish. Only the areas nearest the shoreline have remained impenetrable to the crabs, which come toward shore from deeper waters.
Also unknown, Randall said, is the impact of the crabs on the state's lobster fishery. Lobstermen are reporting more green crabs in their traps, forcing the fishermen to plumb deeper water farther from the coast to find lobsters.
In laboratory settings, green crabs outcompete lobsters, especially when lobsters are still young, she said.
"The devastation is so profound at this point," Randall said.
Both Beal and LePage reiterated that on top of concerns about the environment and the economic threat to clammers' jobs, the state's tourism industry could also take a hit, posing a gustatory dilemma in a state known for its seafood.
"How do you have a clam bake without any clams?" Beal said.

Full text:   The lobster fishery has been the one bright spot in Maine's seafood industry for years -- at least until last week.
On Feb. 18, the state Department of Marine Resources ordered a two-year shutdown of lobster and crab harvesting in a 7-square-mile region at the mouth of the Penobscot River. Mercury contamination from decades-old industrial pollution has reached high levels in the shellfish, and it should not be consumed, regulators say.
It's still unclear who knew about these high levels and for how long, and how many pounds of lobster and crab were harvested and consumed in the meantime.
What should be obvious to everyone, however, is how devastating an event like this could be to one of the state's most important industries and how even a small event could have huge impact on a valuable resource.
Too often, environmental regulation is cast as an impediment to economic growth, and businesspeople and their supporters in government insist that regulators can do the most good by simply getting out of the way.
That is not what was needed here.
Maine's economy is based on its natural resources, which are not limited to seafood such as lobster and crab or produce such as blueberries and potatoes. Maine sells its environment when it attracts tourists and other visitors who employ tens of thousands of Mainers all around the state, all year long.
The notion that Maine's lobsters could be unsafe to eat, or that Maine air and water might not be clean, could be devastating to those industries.
Far from being bad for business, environmental regulation is essential for business to succeed, especially the kinds of businesses that Maine depends on.
Unfortunately, ensuring that justice is done is a slow process. Mallinckrodt LLC, the company responsible for the mercury spilled by HoltraChem Manufacturing, is fighting in court to limit its role in the watershed's cleanup. The court should make sure that the company is held responsible, but prevention would have been better.
The next time we hear a politician complain about too much regulation, we should all remember this situation and reflect about how much trouble good regulation can avoid.

Full text:   Scientists who claimed that Maine officials knew for years about high levels of mercury in lobsters near the mouth of the Penobscot River reversed their account on Friday, saying they never notified the state about the hazardous mercury levels.
The scientists told two news outlets in separate interviews Thursday that they had shared those findings with state officials in reports issued in 2008 and 2009 and in a meeting in 2010, as they continued to work on a court-ordered study of mercury in the river.
But on Friday, after talking among themselves, the researchers said they had misremembered what information had been made available to the state and when it was made available. They said they realized that while state officials did have some information about above-normal mercury levels in lobsters by 2010, none of the data released to that point showed levels high enough to require immediate action.
Although the scientists had test results from 2008 at a site in South Verona that showed for the first time that lobsters had mercury contamination at more than twice the federal warning threshold for consumption, they did not share that information in either of their written reports or at their meeting with state officials in 2010.
"The information available to the state folks back in 2010 was not something that should have prompted firm action. It's the more recent data that's interesting," said Chris Whipple, a member of the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel and an environmental consultant for Environ International Corp. who specializes in radioactive waste, hazardous air pollutants and environmental mercury.
Without that 2008 data -- which only the study panel and its hired researchers had access to - state officials would not have known to act, he said.
John Rudd, chairman of the study panel, also scaled back a statement he made Thursday to the Portland Press Herald, that information about mercury contamination in lobsters had been "available now for a number of years" to state officials.
"They didn't have our more recent data until 2013," said Rudd, a scientist who specializes in freshwater fisheries and oceans and is president of Rudd and Kelly Research Inc. in Canada.
Whipple said his comments Friday differed from those he made Thursday to The Associated Press because another member of the research team contacted him to correct his recollection. He said he had not been contacted by any Maine state official.
The scientists spoke in response to a decision announced Tuesday by the state Department of Marine Resources, which ordered a two-year shutdown of lobster and crab harvesting in a seven-square-mile area where the river meets Penobscot Bay, effective today. The area is only a small fraction of the more than 14,000 square miles in the Gulf of Maine where lobsters are harvested.
The Department of Marine Resources decided to order the closure after receiving the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel's final, 1,800-page report in November and seeking a review of the findings by State Toxicologist Andrew Smith and a team of state analysts, which took three months.
The panel was formed under a judge's order in a federal lawsuit against the former HoltraChem Manufacturing Co., which is accused of dumping mercury waste into the river starting in 1967 and later into landfills at its plant in Orrington, which closed in 2000. Though the panel had completed the report and filed it in U.S. District Court in Bangor by April 19, 2013, state officials said they didn't receive it until the fall, after the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the Maine People's Alliance and the Natural Resources Defense Council, shared it with them.
The federal court case began in 2000, when the two groups sued HoltraChem Manufacturing and its inheritor, St. Louis-based Mallinckrodt LLC, over mercury contamination. The 2013 report is central to an upcoming trial in the case that will start on May 7.
Whipple said the members of the study panel held a workshop in September 2010 to explain the scope of what they had been commissioned to investigate. Representatives from the state Department of Environmental Protection, the attorney general's office, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the Department of Marine Resources, the University of Maine, several federal agencies, lawyers and those involved in the lawsuit attended the workshop.
"One of the reasons we held the workshop is, we knew the state agencies were interested in what we were doing because we were doing it in their backyard, and our work was somewhat mysterious to them," Whipple said.
Whipple said he thought initially, when he spoke to the media on Thursday, that detailed lobster studies had been presented at that workshop. He said he realized on Friday that all of the data shared at the meeting had been collected before 2007.
"At the time of that meeting, we had not done any lobster samples north of Fort Point Cove," Whipple said.
"Data from South Verona and Odom Ledge were not made available until April of 2013," Whipple said, referring to areas near the mouth of the river where the researchers found high mercury levels in lobsters in tests from 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012. "The farther north you get, the higher the mercury contamination."
Rudd said he now agrees with Whipple that state officials did not have the data from studies north of Fort Point Cove until 2013. But he said that data presented before 2010 indicated that lobster samples had mercury readings above 200 nanograms per gram of tissue, roughly the amount of mercury found in a can of white tuna.
Findings released in April 2013 show that lobsters taken from the South Verona sample site in 2008, 2009 and 2010 showed mercury levels ranging from just less than 400 nanograms per gram of meat to as much as 475.
Readings from lobsters taken during the same period at Odom Ledge ranged from less than 200 to more than 250 nanograms per gram of lobster meat, according to the panel's final report.
Smith, the state toxicologist, said 200 nanograms per gram of tissue is "the starting point at which we begin to consider recommending limits on fish/shellfish consumption," not the point at which consumption should be banned.
"We have a policy that if you cannot eat at least an eight-ounce meal of fish or shellfish per week without reaching the toxicity level, then we will begin to consider issuing an advisory," Smith said Friday. "We also have a policy that if you cannot eat at least a meal a month, then we say don't eat any at all."
Lobsters harvested elsewhere along the coast of Maine have an average mercury reading of about 50 nanograms per gram of lobster meat, he said earlier this week. Two average-size lobsters yield about eight ounces of meat.
"By way of example, if an average level of mercury in fish tissue was around 400 ng/g, we would recommend consumption limits of no more than four ounces per week," Smith said in an email Friday.
Smith, who was out of the office for part of this week, returned to work Friday to reassess what information the state received from the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel before last fall and whether the state should have acted differently in light of that data.
"We would have found they could eat about a meal, an eight-ounce meal, per week and we would not have issued an advisory," Smith said.
The Press Herald sent a letter Thursday to Judge John Woodcock Jr., who is presiding over the federal case, asking him whether anyone involved in the court case had disclosed the discovery of hazardous levels of mercury to the public and, if not, why not.
Eric Storms, chief deputy clerk for U.S. District Court in Maine, said Friday that Woodcock cannot respond to that letter while the case is pending, for ethical reasons. Storms answered some of those questions in the judge's place.
"The court couldn't disseminate the report itself," Storms said. "The court has to be careful not to act as an advocate. This report itself is still in dispute."
Storms also said that information given to the Press Herald that a gag order had been imposed on parties in the case was inaccurate. The parties to the lawsuit and the panel of scientists, not the court itself, could have disseminated the report.
"The court has expressly allowed the study panel to have contact with other agencies to facilitate their work. It's just that they have to inform the court about that," Storms said.
Whipple, reached Friday afternoon to answer follow-up questions from the morning, said he had since been asked to limit his comments about the panel's work and refer anyone with questions to the published reports of its finding.

Full text:   A Canadian businessman says he has a solution to the population explosion of green crabs, which are ravaging Maine's valuable shellfish industry: Put the crabs on menus around the world.
"We are going to take that invasive species and turn it into gold," said Ron Howse, president and CEO of the Tidalwater Seafood Co., based in Fredericton, New Brunswick.
Howse, who has no background in the seafood industry, plans to process green crabs in Maine and market the meat and live crabs to customers in Japan, Korea, China, Spain and Portugal. He said Asian and European consumers will pay good money for green crabs, which are pests in Maine because they eat clams and mussels, steal bait from lobster traps, destroy eelgrass beds and damage salt marshes.
Howse, 65, said he's looking at opening a processing plant in the Brunswick or Bangor area to pick the meat from green crabs, and he may set up holding facilities along the Maine coast. He said there's also a significant market for live crabs, which could be shipped to Asia and Europe on flights from the Bangor International Airport.
Howse said there's enough money to finance the business plan if he gets some financial support from community development groups in the state. He said he has significant private funds available, but he wouldn't provide details about the amount of money he has or the amount he would need to raise.
Clam diggers and marine resource managers are cautiously optimistic that Howse has come up with a workable business solution, something that would be remarkable because all other attempts have failed.
The crabs have no commercial value now, in part because their bodies are so small that the meat can't be removed efficiently.
Some composting companies will take the crabs, but they won't pay for them. Recent attempts to create a market for them as bait or cat food have gone nowhere.
Clam diggers hope Howse's plan will work but still have a "wait-and-see" attitude, said Daniel Devereaux, who manages the clam flats in Brunswick as the town's marine warden.
"I have eaten them," he said. "They are great-tasting. You've just got to eat 300 of them."
If nothing is done to reduce the green crab population, clam diggers will be out of business in two years, said Steve Follette, 67, a clam digger who co-chairs the Frenchman Bay Regional Shellfish Conservation Committee in Down East Maine.
"It's going to give everyone an incentive to trap them," he said of Howse's plan. "If you make your living out of the sea, you would be stupid not to."
An adult European green crab is typically about 2½ inches long. It is distinguished from other crabs by five pointed spines on the outside of each eye and three small, rounded spines between the eyes.
The crabs arrived in Maine waters nearly 100 years ago, and their population goes through boom-and-bust cycles, said Denis Nault, supervisor of the shellfish management program at the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
He said the population is now at the highest level the state has ever seen, and Casco Bay is being hit the hardest.
Clam diggers Down East expect the population boom will move up the coast and strike their mud flats next year, Follette said.
"It's a wave that is unbelievable. It's like a science fiction movie," he said.
In preparation for the dredging of Portland Harbor, crews have been trapping and moving lobsters this winter. Over a one-month period that ended Jan. 27, they captured 28,219 green crabs in the process.
They have been killing the crabs and dumping their bodies at sea. Howse said he plans to buy 80 pounds from the crews on Thursday. He has been paying harvesters 50 cents a pound.
Nault said attempts to create a commercial fishery for green crabs and use them for cat food or bait have failed because the prices are too low to justify the cost of harvesting, processing and transportation. Marketing the crabs as food for people has a better chance of success because it would increase the value.
He said the state issues permits to towns for crab eradication efforts, and the state would be able to issue more permits if there were a viable commercial fishery.
One issue is that the traps must be designed so that fishermen catch crabs, and not juvenile lobsters.
With green crabs, Nault said, overharvesting won't be a problem.
"You are not going to eliminate this critter," he said.

Full text:   In a building attached to the back of Ernie's Pool and Darts on Forest Avenue, three friends are trying to fill a niche that's been missing in Portland's local food movement.
Khanh Le was the first of them to notice it.
After moving to Portland for its reputed food scene, he realized restaurant menus and farmers markets rarely carried local mushrooms. A financier by trade, he saw a potential venture.
It turns out he wasn't the only one with that thought.
Within the past year or two, Le and his crew, a family in Springvale, old high school classmates in Warren and forager friends in New Hampshire all have started indoor mushroom farms after discovering an unfulfilled demand for locally grown specialty varieties that are available year-round.
Last month, a Portland architect received a special exemption from the Westbrook Planning Board to grow culinary mushrooms in a former flea market building at Prides Corner.
Although foragers have long supplied wild Maine mushrooms to Portland restaurants and retailers, they're available only from spring to fall, and even then are subject to the weather. The fickle fungi also have a short shelf life, so quality is lost when they come from away.
In climate-controlled buildings, mushrooms can grow anywhere all year, though it's more expensive in colder weather - possibly the reason few in Maine have embarked on it until now.
Candice Heydon is the exception.
"When I started selling shiitake and growing it, people couldn't pronounce the word," said Heydon, owner of the Oyster Creek Mushroom Co. in Damariscotta.
That was 25 years ago, when she was clearing land to build a house and found out the University of Maine Cooperative Extension was offering a class on growing Asian mushrooms on oak - the very type of trees she was cutting down.
After taking the class, the longtime waitress and cook decided she was sick of working for other people and would start her own business growing mushrooms.
"I was the only one for a while," said Heydon, who annually sells about 40,000 pounds of mushrooms, which she grows herself and buys from other farms and foragers.
Will Manahan and Jon Vickerman, a boat builder and cook who met at Medomak Valley High School, in Waldoboro, are some of her newest sources.
Last year was the first full year in operation for their Pleasant Mountain Mushroom Farm, which produces 30 to 50 pounds of Italian oyster mushrooms a week, Manahan said.
That's enough to supply a couple of farmers' markets and a few area eateries, including Rockland's renowned farm-to-table restaurant, Primo.
"Whatever we grow we have no problem getting rid of," Manahan said.
They hope to expand beyond his mother's land in Warren and eventually work on the farm full time.
In Portland, Le and his friend Scott Payson's Bountiful Mushrooms Farm already is supporting one full-time employee, mushroom-growing guru Devin Stehlin. Le and Payson have kept their day jobs.
Payson said the business has just started breaking even, and the owners expect to start recouping some of their investment later this year.
He said they probably could have gotten the farm up and running for less than $100,000 - if they knew what they were doing. Instead, he said, there's been "a lot of trial and error."
The urban farm is now producing 300 to 600 pounds a week of shiitake, oyster and lion's mane mushrooms, which sell for $8 to $12 per pound. The growing process, in which they mix mushroom spawn in plastic bags of either sawdust or straw and place them in humid tents, takes between two weeks and two months, depending on the variety.
But harvesting happens daily, as does delivery of the mushrooms, which are on menus at 16 local restaurants.
Local 188 in Portland was the company's first customer. On a Tuesday afternoon last month, Payson brought paper bags filled with more than 6 pounds of mushrooms into the Congress Street restaurant.
Before he could get them to the walk-in refrigerator downstairs, chef and owner Jay Villani grabbed a bag of golden oysters and ripped it open. He would be keeping them in the kitchen with him.
"I'll use these for the risotto tonight," he said.
Villani said he had been getting mushrooms from a farm in New Hampshire until it shut down. He's been using Bountiful Mushrooms since a sample bag showed up in his restaurant last year.
"It's just nice to have a constant supply," he said.
Because the owners of Bountiful Mushrooms Farm brought samples to all their favorite spots, their customer base grew and now ranges from Portland fine-dining mainstay Fore Street to Alewive's Brook Farm in Cape Elizabeth, which sells the mushrooms at farmers markets.
"When we sell out or don't have them for a day, people are always looking for them," said Caitlin Jordan of Alewive's.
Le said he isn't concerned about competition from the yet-to-open Westbrook farm, which owner Christopher Campbell declined to discuss.
"We think that there's plenty of demand in this area," Le said.
Between the growing love of all things local and increasing interest in eating healthy, specialty mushrooms have found "a rapidly growing market," said John Sharood, chief operating officer of Farming Fungi in Springvale.
Specialty mushroom production neared about 20 million pounds and sales were valued at about $65 million nationwide in 2012-2013, up from 13 million pounds and $34 million a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
A report by the Mushroom Council, a promotional and research board established by Congress, showed that, between 2006 and 2012, specialty varieties accounted for an increase in the incidence of mushrooms on restaurant menus in the U.S. While garden-variety white button mushrooms remained in about 80 percent of restaurants, matsutakes, black trumpets, truffles and criminis doubled in popularity.
Sharood said Maine, in particular, has "a large number of highly sophisticated consumers that like organic and specialty foods."
Farming Fungi, which he started with his son and daughter, is the state's only certified organic mushroom farm and has grown at least nine varieties, including pioppino and chicken of the woods.
Sharood wouldn't reveal the company's current yield, but he said the goal is to be producing more than 1,000 pounds a week soon and serving markets from Montreal to Connecticut.
Under the Mousam Valley Mushrooms brand name, the company is selling to six restaurants and small stores in York County, as well as Hannaford supermarkets in Portland, Scarborough, Kennebunk and soon Sanford.
The Scarborough-based grocery store chain offers a lot of opportunity for expansion. Hannaford's sources for mushrooms vary from store to store, but most come from Pennsylvania and California - the country's hotbeds of mushroom farms.
Eric Blom, a spokesman for Hannaford, said the company constantly is trying to increase the number of local vendors it uses and would gladly add more mushroom growers.
"We're always looking," he said.
Food sellers aren't the only potential customers for mushroom farms, according to Eric Milligan, an owner of the New Hampshire Mushroom Co.
The Tamworth, N.H., business, which started growing in late 2012, has begun producing medicinal mushrooms, in addition to the rotation of about 10 culinary varieties it sells to more than 100 restaurants in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, as well as seven wholesalers, including Native Maine Produce.
Milligan started the farm with two fellow foragers who decided to take their hobby and try to turn a profit. They're almost halfway to their goal of producing 2,000 pounds a week by this summer. Within four years, they plan to expand their weekly output to between 10,000 and 50,000 pounds.
Milligan sees endless uses - and markets - for his mushrooms, from producing biofuels to cleaning up oil spills.
"They are all ways we believe mushrooms can be used to help save the world," he said.

Full text:   I am writing in response to the article on Jan. 23 regarding the worming and clamming industry.
I dug worms for 40-plus years. I am now retired, but I have seen this animosity between the two groups happen for years.
Did anyone ever check to see how many clam diggers also have worm digger licenses so they can dig worms during red tide shutdowns when the clam flats are closed?
It didn't used to be this way until the state gave towns the right to control licensing. By doing this, the towns took away the livelihood of a lot of diggers who used to dig both clams and worms.
This has caused the animosity between the two groups because wormers can no longer dig clams, but there is no restriction against clammers digging worms.
I believe that nothing happens when worm diggers complain to the state about circumstances that threaten their livelihood.
When clam diggers complain about circumstances that threaten their livelihood, however, the state seems to consistently support their concerns over the concerns of worm diggers.

Full text:   Bill to protect flats pits wormers against clammers
AUGUSTA -- George Lemar's nickname is Whispering George.
But Lemar, a 57-year marine worm harvester from Wiscasset, didn't whisper on Wednesday.
"We don't come up here and ask you guys for anything," Lemar bellowed at the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee. "All we ask is that you leave us alone!"
Lemar's remarks were cut short. He was escorted out of the committee room as tempers flared over a bill that drew close to 100 clam diggers and worm diggers to the State House.
The bill, as originally proposed last year, would have allowed towns to prohibit digging in sections of intertidal mud flats to reseed and grow juvenile clams. Proponents said the bill was designed to combat an exploding population of invasive green crabs that's decimating the $15.6 million soft shell clam industry, Maine's third-largest commercial fishery.
But Lemar and the dozens of other worm diggers who testified against the bill Wednesday suspected a sinister motive.
"This is about control over the mud," said John Renwick, a worm digger from Birch Harbor who said the bill would let towns restrict the harvesting of not just clams, but worms, too. Renwick said that control is already in the hands of a few: clammers, some of whom have chased him off mud flats with threats of "bodily harm and even death."
The Marine Resources Committee endorsed an amended version of the bill in a 12-1 vote Wednesday afternoon. That version, which apparently would have a more limited impact on wormers, would allow towns to fine anyone who dismantles fencing or netting used to protect clam flats from the predatory crabs.
Control of the mud is the central concern for worm diggers, who said the bill, sponsored by Sen. Stan Gerzofsky, D-Brunswick, is an attempt to force them off the flats.
But for Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association, the proposal is about saving a shellfish population that he said could be off limits to commercial harvesting in two years, an outcome that could put about 1,700 licensed clammers out of work.
"Nobody is trying to be critical of anybody else," said Coffin, who urged lawmakers to move quickly.
A study published last year by Brian Beal, a marine ecology professor at the University of Maine at Machias, said the European green crab's resurgence on the Maine coast is reminiscent of a population boom in the 1950s that led to a 56.5 percent decline in soft shell clam landings over a 10-year period.
Repeating history could devastate the soft shell clam industry, which has thrived over the past 12 years. In 2000, the fishery was worth $9.5 million and clammers fetched 85 cents a pound. In 2012, the fishery was worth $15.6 million and harvesters earned $1.42 per pound.
Marine worms, known as bloodworms and used as fishing bait, were worth a total of $5 million and $11.35 per pound in 2012. The harvest was worth $1.6 million in 2000, a low year for a fishery that consistently grossed $5 million to $7 million over the past decade, according to state data.
Clams and worms are harvested on intertidal flats -- muddy areas that are under water at high tide. Some clammers also work as wormers at times, and vice versa. But Sen. Chris Johnson, D-Somerville, a co-chairman of the Marine Resources Committee, said the two groups don't always trust each other.
That was evident at Wednesday's public hearing.
Supporters of the bill said it isn't meant to target worm diggers. But worm diggers have been on the defensive since the bill was introduced, and several noted its title, "An Act To Allow Municipalities with Shellfish Conservation Ordinances To Request Permission To Prohibit Marine Worm Harvesting."
The first draft of the bill would have allowed towns to prohibit worm digging in conservation and seed clam areas. Clamming would have been allowed. The bill was amended recently to prohibit both.
The change doesn't matter to Fred Johnson, a worm harvester from Steuben who said the bill would give towns too much control over intertidal flats, which are in the public domain.
Lemar reiterated that point, raising his voice as lawmakers tried to cut off his remarks.
"Those flats belong to the people of Maine, not the towns, not you," he said.
Supporters of the bill tried to downplay the division between the clammers and worm harvesters.
"L.D. 1452 will be played out today as one industry trying to gain exclusive fishing rights over another," said Dan Devereaux, the marine resources officer for Brunswick. "In reality, there is no preference to one industry over the other in the amendment."
The state has allowed towns with certified shellfish management plans to issue soft shell clamming licenses based on local shellfish inventories. Brunswick, which has some of Maine's most productive clam flats, issued 68 licenses in 2011. Mark Latti, chairman of the Brunswick Marine Resources Committee, told the committee Wednesday that the town will issue only 43 licenses this year.
The drop is a result of the green crab invasion, town officials said.
"If this was a small business closing ... it would be front page news," Latti said. "However, these jobs seem to fade away without much notice."
Towns and the Maine Clammers Association have explored ways to combat green crabs, but the results have done little to stop the destruction.
Last year, Freeport approved a $65,000 study to determine whether trapping, fencing and netting techniques can stop crabs. The experiment was overseen by Beal, the professor at the University of Maine at Machias. Beal planned to install hundreds of feet of plastic fencing across the mouths of coves in Freeport.
Maine Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher testified against the bill Wednesday morning, but said later that his department could support a proposal that imposes fines for removing protective fencing.
Under the amended bill that the committee sent to the full Legislature with its endorsement, towns that put protective fencing around a clam flat could impose fines of $300 to $1,500 for dismantling the fencing.

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- George Lemar's nickname is Whispering George.
But Lemar, a 57-year marine worm harvester from Wiscasset, didn't whisper on Wednesday.
"We don't come up here and ask you guys for anything," Lemar bellowed at the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee. "All we ask is that you leave us alone!"
Lemar's remarks were cut short. He was escorted out of the committee room as tempers flared over a bill that drew close to 100 clam diggers and worm diggers to the State House.
The bill, as originally proposed last year, would have allowed towns to prohibit digging in sections of intertidal mud flats to reseed and grow juvenile clams. Proponents said the bill was designed to combat an exploding population of invasive green crabs that's decimating the $15.6 million soft shell clam industry, Maine's third-largest commercial fishery.
But Lemar and the dozens of other worm diggers who testified against the bill Wednesday suspected a sinister motive.
"This is about control over the mud," said John Renwick, a worm digger from Birch Harbor who said the bill would let towns restrict the harvesting of not just clams, but worms, too. Renwick said that control is already in the hands of a few: clammers, some of whom have chased him off mud flats with threats of "bodily harm and even death."
The Marine Resources Committee endorsed an amended version of the bill in a 12-1 vote Wednesday afternoon. That version, which apparently would have a more limited impact on wormers, would allow towns to fine anyone who dismantles fencing or netting used to protect clam flats from the predatory crabs.
Control of the mud is the central concern for worm diggers, who said the bill, sponsored by Sen. Stan Gerzofsky, D-Brunswick, is an attempt to force them off the flats.
But for Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association, the proposal is about saving a shellfish population that he said could be off limits to commercial harvesting in two years, an outcome that could put about 1,700 licensed clammers out of work.
"Nobody is trying to be critical of anybody else," said Coffin, who urged lawmakers to move quickly.
A study published last year by Brian Beal, a marine ecology professor at the University of Maine at Machias, said the European green crab's resurgence on the Maine coast is reminiscent of a population boom in the 1950s that led to a 56.5 percent decline in soft shell clam landings over a 10-year period.
Repeating history could devastate the soft shell clam industry, which has thrived over the past 12 years. In 2000, the fishery was worth $9.5 million and clammers fetched 85 cents a pound. In 2012, the fishery was worth $15.6 million and harvesters earned $1.42 per pound.
Marine worms, known as bloodworms and used as fishing bait, were worth a total of $5 million and $11.35 per pound in 2012. The harvest was worth $1.6 million in 2000, a low year for a fishery that consistently grossed $5 million to $7 million over the past decade, according to state data.
Clams and worms are harvested on intertidal flats -- muddy areas that are under water at high tide. Some clammers also work as wormers at times, and vice versa. But Sen. Chris Johnson, D-Somerville, a co-chairman of the Marine Resources Committee, said the two groups don't always trust each other.
That was evident at Wednesday's public hearing.
Supporters of the bill said it isn't meant to target worm diggers. But worm diggers have been on the defensive since the bill was introduced, and several noted its title, "An Act To Allow Municipalities with Shellfish Conservation Ordinances To Request Permission To Prohibit Marine Worm Harvesting."
The first draft of the bill would have allowed towns to prohibit worm digging in conservation and seed clam areas. Clamming would have been allowed. The bill was amended recently to prohibit both.
The change doesn't matter to Fred Johnson, a worm harvester from Steuben who said the bill would give towns too much control over intertidal flats, which are in the public domain.
Lemar reiterated that point, raising his voice as lawmakers tried to cut off his remarks.
"Those flats belong to the people of Maine, not the towns, not you," he said.
Supporters of the bill tried to downplay the division between the clammers and worm harvesters.
"L.D. 1452 will be played out today as one industry trying to gain exclusive fishing rights over another," said Dan Devereaux, the marine resources officer for Brunswick. "In reality, there is no preference to one industry over the other in the amendment."
The state has allowed towns with certified shellfish management plans to issue soft shell clamming licenses based on local shellfish inventories. Brunswick, which has some of Maine's most productive clam flats, issued 68 licenses in 2011. Mark Latti, chairman of the Brunswick Marine Resources Committee, told the committee Wednesday that the town will issue only 43 licenses this year.
The drop is a result of the green crab invasion, town officials said.
"If this was a small business closing ... it would be front page news," Latti said. "However, these jobs seem to fade away without much notice."
Towns and the Maine Clammers Association have explored ways to combat green crabs, but the results have done little to stop the destruction.
Last year, Freeport approved a $65,000 study to determine whether trapping, fencing and netting techniques can stop crabs. The experiment was overseen by Beal, the professor at the University of Maine at Machias. Beal planned to install hundreds of feet of plastic fencing across the mouths of coves in Freeport.
Maine Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher testified against the bill Wednesday morning, but said later that his department could support a proposal that imposes fines for removing protective fencing.
Under the amended bill that the committee sent to the full Legislature with its endorsement, towns that put protective fencing around a clam flat could impose fines of $300 to $1,500 for dismantling the fencing.

Full text:   15 INTERESTING HISTORIC SITES TO VISIT
ALONG THE COAST AND RIVERS OF MAINE
By David B. MacNab
Maine Authors Publishing, 2013
86 pages, $17.95
ISBN 978-1-938883-61-3

A wise British politician once said: "A country losing touch with its own history is like an old man losing his glasses, a distressing sight, at once vulnerable, unsure and easily distracted."
For that reason, it is important for Mainers to know their own state history, and David MacNab's first book is a clever travel guide featuring 15 historic sites along the Maine coast and its rivers -- from far Down East at an early French settlement on St. Croix Island near Calais, south to Fort McClary (c. 1808) at Kittery Point.
This slim volume is a handy reference for finding such interesting places as the Whaleback Shell Midden near Damariscotta, where ancient people 2,000 years ago gathered to harvest shellfish, and the Percy and Small Shipyard at the Maine Maritime Museum in Bath where the great schooners were built from 1897 to 1920. Nine of the sites highlight forts and blockhouses reflecting Maine's military history from colonial times to the Civil War.
The book is well-organized, providing detailed information on directions, access, admission, contact data and unique details such as parking availability and whether the sites are open seasonally or all year. MacNab also wisely includes descriptions and histories of the sites.
Learn how and why forts and blockhouses were built, why a Civil War vice president of the United States also served as the company cook in a Maine militia unit, what it was like to be imprisoned in the Old York Gaol in 1656 and about the American traitor who rested at Fort Western in Augusta in 1775.
For more interesting reading about Maine history, see "Rivers of Fortune: Where Tides and Money Flowed" by Bill Caldwell (Downeast Books, 1983) and "Eminent Mainers" by Arthur Douglas Stover (Tilbury House, 2006).

FINAL SETTLEMENT:
A DARBY FARR MYSTERY
By Vicki Doudera
Midnight Ink, 2013
325 pages, $14.99
ISBN 978-0-7387-3428-6
Lorraine Delvecchio is a neat, mousy woman with hyperthymesia -- the uncanny ability to remember everything. Otherwise an unremarkable woman, maybe it is her memory that gets her killed. But dead she is, and most folks in Hurricane Harbor, Maine, can't figure out why. Five people know, and they're not talking.
"Final Settlement" is Camden author Vicki Doudera's fourth book in her mystery series (after "Deadly Offer") featuring real estate agent and amateur sleuth Darby Farr. Doudera is herself a mid-coast realtor as well as a mystery writer.
Despite several unconvincing scenes and detail inconsistencies, this is an entertaining mystery -- fun to read and easy to follow, with just enough suspense and action to keep everyone guessing.
Darby is back in her hometown to attend the February wedding of her best friend, Tina. Lorraine's death, however, puzzles the local police chief who asks for Darby's help in discovering the truth. The investigating detective concludes Lorraine's death was accidental, but Darby and the chief don't believe it.
Wedding preparations during a bitterly cold Maine blizzard are no fun, but the tragic result of a deadly cop shooting convinces Darby that her hunch is right -- Lorraine was murdered, but why?
As she follows some cryptic clues, she learns that lots of people are happy to see Lorraine dead for a wide variety of reasons, and everyone is lying. A coded journal leads her to an unusual list of suspects with seemingly nothing in common.
A curious and lethal side plot -- unrelated to Lorraine's murder -- surfaces that puts Darby's life in jeopardy. But Lorraine's killer has murdered again, and Darby may be the next victim. Nobody here gets killed over a real estate deal gone bad. The real motive for murder is much more basic, insidious and dangerous.
Bill Bushnell lives and writes in Harpswell.

Full text:   The island near Yarmouth harbor where L.L. Bean hunted for ducks in the 1930s and where rare birds still nest each year will be preserved in perpetuity for the public to enjoy, a statewide conservation group said Monday.
The family of Leon Gorman, grandson of Leon L. Bean, donated the 28-acre Lanes Island, adding to the growing list of more than 300 islands preserved by Maine Coast Heritage Trust.
The trust's president, Tim Glidden, called the island a "precious resource" in a statement announcing the preservation.
"With more people realizing what a unique quality of life and place there is in this region, it is essential that we continue the important work of maintaining and expanding public access to the land," Glidden said. "We are grateful to Leon and Lisa Gorman for their vision and generosity in making this gift."
The Gorman family began purchasing portions of the island in 1968 before acquiring the final segment in 2010.
The trust will work in the coming months to form a management plan to balance the preservation of habitat with the new opportunities for public boating, hiking and camping. Clammers also harvest shellfish each year from the mudflats surrounding Lanes Island, but their activity will not be affected by the donation, said Nat Tupper, Yarmouth town manager. The island had generated about $8,800 in tax revenue per year for the town before preservation, Tupper said.
The island was originally named after James Lane, of Malden, Mass., who acquired it and another parcel on the mainland during the period when Massachusetts Bay Colony residents were offered land grants in what is now Maine.
In 1658, Lane settled in what was called North Yarmouth -- in present-day Yarmouth -- until he was killed by Native Americans and his family fled back to Massachusetts, according to a 1902 book of Lane family genealogy, which is preserved by the Yarmouth Historical Society.
According to the same historical account, the island was known as a headquarters for local Native American fishermen and served as a meeting place and burial ground, said Michael Chaney, director of the Yarmouth Historical Society.
"Tradition marks the island as the place where the Indians planted corn, held councils, tortured their captives and buried their dead," Chaney said, reading from the historical document.
Research by the society backs up the claim that the island was a burial ground, Chaney said. As early as 1833, settlers recorded finding bones buried in the sand.
Along with continued human use, the state has also recognized the island as ecologically significant because of the waterfowl and shorebirds that nest there, including bald eagles.
The Maine Coast Heritage Trust is working toward preserving two other islands. Across the bay in Harpswell, the trust is working to acquire the Goslings, two small islands with a history of public access under private ownership. If successful, acquiring Goslings would complement the trust's recent conservation of a portion of neighboring Lower Goose Island.
A separate fundraising effort is under way to buy and preserve roughly half of Clapboard Island in Falmouth, which had been under private ownership since 1898 and remains closed to public use.
The Maine Coast Heritage Trust has placed the Clapboard Island land under contract for about $1.4 million, but needs to raise the money to complete the project. On Monday, a representative from the trust presented a funding pitch to Falmouth town councilors.
The purchase plan calls for the town to pitch in between $300,000 and $500,000, depending on the success of fundraising and how much is netted from the sale of a cottage that stands on Clapboard Island, said Keith Fletcher, a project manager at Maine Coast Heritage Trust.
Along with the town and private donors, the Pew Foundantion has pledged to match a portion of funds raised to purchase Clapboard.

Full text:   handyman would be handy
I can get my house painted inside and out, new windows put in, a complete roof remake. I can get my lawn mowed, raked and seeded. I can have a new boiler put in, the basement redone, floors polished and my dog groomed. But I can't find anyone to fix a drawer.
The drawer is in the upstairs bathroom. It's part of an oversized vanity, much like my own. It has two big drawers, hers and mine. Wouldn't you know that it's mine that's broken? It appears that the sliding fixtures have detached somewhere in the back, and the drawer sort of hangs there like Quasimodo, who has forgotten where the bells are.
I tried fixing it myself and for a piece of time, it worked; then, like everything else I've fixed in life, such as my daughter's tricycle, it came undone and it's hanging there.
The problem is the once-ubiquitous handyman has faded from the American scene.
There was a time when I was younger, back around the time Franklin Roosevelt defeated Wendell Willkie, that the landscape was sprinkled with handymen. It was an honorable profession, almost like being a bus driver or school janitor. Every American neighborhood from St. Louis to New Orleans to Waterville had one or two.
When not working fixing porches, banisters, window sashes and cellar doors, one could be found up on a ladder somewhere or sitting in a corner table at the local diner, sipping soup or munching on the daily blue plate special. He had a universal costume -- old blue jeans or work khaki pants carried over from the last parts of his First or Second World War uniform.
Maybe he had a worn leather fading bomber jacket worn over a denim shirt, and he looked like an older Tommy Lee Jones, wearing that stained old fedora, slumped over a bowl of soup or standing on the corner, trying to light a Camel cigarette in the wind.
In my childhood, I knew such a man. His name was Barney, and he lived with his mother on the top floor of a two-family flat across the street from the Catholic church.
Barney walked with a slight limp favoring his right side. One of the firemen at the firehouse said it was because that's where he carried his tool box.
Mr. Schneider at the drug store said that Barney had lost the lower part of his right leg at Pearl Harbor, and that was sad, he said, because he had been a great baseball player in high school.
In the late '30s, when I was old enough to start being aware of things like that, there were men and boys everywhere to fix things. But then my father died without saying goodbye, and Pearl Harbor was bombed and suddenly the family handymen were gone. Then somewhere around 1944, Barney was there, limping down Soper Street with his tool box, and all the widows and blue and gold star mothers were hiring him to patch up their neglected homes.
It worked like this. If my mother got tired of stepping over the broken board on the back porch, she would send me up the street to Barney's house. I would knock on the door, and his mother, who worked for Father Keating across the street, would come to the door wiping her hands on her apron that had pictures of autumn leaves on it. You remember things like that when you're a strange, lonely little boy with no brothers around.
I would ask her then, "Is Barney home?" He never was. She would tell me where he was working in the neighborhood, or that he was having chili for lunch at Auel's cafe on the corner. Then I would go there and find him and tell him that my mother needed him.
He would listen to me and nod, and say he'd be over.
Sometimes he would give me the extra oyster crackers that came with his chili.
So here I am, some hundred years later, with a broken drawer and no Barney; and my brothers, who were always good at fixing things, are all gone to the other side.
I asked around today, and everyone said they were all busy plowing snow or painting a house or building one. If you have a Barney in your neighborhood, let me know. I'll walk over and see if he's home.

Full text:   In general, people tend to denote the passing of time by the four seasons. Hunters, on the other hand, recognize it is often the transitions between the seasons that are of greatest importance. And as we turn the calendar page from November to December we enter a significant transition period between fall and winter.
For many (but not all) deer hunters, the season is over. Firearms hunters represent the bulk of the group and their season ends the Saturday after Thanksgiving. There are far fewer of them, but the deer are still out there and so will be a small contingent of hardy souls who brave the bitter cold armed with muzzleloaders, or bows in the expanded archery zones.
It's a different game now. Wary whitetails have been chased around for more than a month and their numbers thinned considerably, making them harder to find. Locating concentrated food sources becomes a priority for both hunter and hunted, and a stationary hunter would do well to set up among the oaks or near a well-managed food plot. More restless hunters might do well to pair up and ease through the brush, possibly putting a hiding buck on its feet.
Meanwhile mobile hunters should also have the advantage of snow. Fresh snow means every track is new and at the other end is the animal that made it. The contest becomes following it to the source without being detected.
Regardless of whether tags are filled, a third, smaller faction of deer hunters will switch to lighter caliber weapons and try to match wits with wily predators like coyotes and bobcats. Some will call, others sit over bait stations and some will run hounds. For the latter it is the chase that matters most. But for all, a successful conclusion to the hunt also means there may be a few more deer around next season.
With most of the deer hunters out of the woods, upland bird hunters and their dogs get a chance for some late-season action. Unable to probe their bills into the frozen soil in search of worms, the woodcock have flown south. But grouse remain in their native haunts and the leafless trees afford open shooting.
Upland gunners may find a few remnant pheasants in stocked areas as well. Few of these non-native birds will last the winter, those not falling to the gun will succumb to predators and the elements, so there's little harm to the population in thinning them now.
Waterfowl and waterfowlers alike are transitioning toward the coast. As smaller ponds and streams ice over, birds move first toward larger inland water bodies and waterways. When those freeze some birds head south while others move to the coast, where blacks and mallards will raft up along rocky shores and tidal marshes.
Meanwhile, the cold weather has also pushed down divers -- buffleheads and goldeneyes -- along with increasingly larger numbers of eiders and old squaw. Some of the frailer sea ducks -- such as scoters -- have moved on, but the eiders and diminutive distant cousins will remain in coastal waters through the winter, fattening up on shellfish and crustaceans.
This is not a sport for the faint of heart or ill-prepared wildfowler. Hunters and dogs must be equipped to handle often harsh conditions, but sometimes the coldest temperatures provide the hottest shooting action.
As the month winds on and the calendar marks the official change of seasons, we'll experience another transition. A few hardy souls will continue to gun the icy ocean waters and predator hunters will ramp up their activity. But a good many sportsmen will hang up the guns and haul out the ice traps and snowmobiles.

Full text:   In general, people tend to denote the passing of time by the four seasons. Hunters, on the other hand, recognize it is often the transitions between the seasons that are of greatest importance. And as we turn the calendar page from November to December we enter a significant transition period between fall and winter.
For many (but not all) deer hunters, the season is over. Firearms hunters represent the bulk of the group and their season ends the Saturday after Thanksgiving. There are far fewer of them, but the deer are still out there and so will be a small contingent of hardy souls who brave the bitter cold armed with muzzleloaders, or bows in the expanded archery zones.
It's a different game now. Wary whitetails have been chased around for more than a month and their numbers thinned considerably, making them harder to find. Locating concentrated food sources becomes a priority for both hunter and hunted, and a stationary hunter would do well to set up among the oaks or near a well-managed food plot. More restless hunters might do well to pair up and ease through the brush, possibly putting a hiding buck on its feet.
Meanwhile mobile hunters should also have the advantage of snow. Fresh snow means every track is new and at the other end is the animal that made it. The contest becomes following it to the source without being detected.
Regardless of whether tags are filled, a third, smaller faction of deer hunters will switch to lighter caliber weapons and try to match wits with wily predators like coyotes and bobcats. Some will call, others sit over bait stations and some will run hounds. For the latter it is the chase that matters most. But for all, a successful conclusion to the hunt also means there may be a few more deer around next season.
With most of the deer hunters out of the woods, upland bird hunters and their dogs get a chance for some late-season action. Unable to probe their bills into the frozen soil in search of worms, the woodcock have flown south. But grouse remain in their native haunts and the leafless trees afford open shooting.
Upland gunners may find a few remnant pheasants in stocked areas as well. Few of these non-native birds will last the winter, those not falling to the gun will succumb to predators and the elements, so there's little harm to the population in thinning them now.

Full text:   I can get my house painted inside and out, new windows put in, a complete roof remake. I can get my lawn mowed, raked and seeded. I can have a new boiler put in, the basement redone, floors polished and my dog groomed. But I can't find anyone to fix a drawer.
The drawer is in the upstairs bathroom. It's part of an oversized vanity, much like my own. It has two big drawers, hers and mine. Wouldn't you know that it's mine that's broken? It appears that the sliding fixtures have detached somewhere in the back, and the drawer sort of hangs there like Quasimodo, who has forgotten where the bells are.
I tried fixing it myself and for a piece of time, it worked; then, like everything else I've fixed in life, such as my daughter's tricycle, it came undone and it's hanging there.
The problem is the once-ubiquitous handyman has faded from the American scene.
There was a time when I was younger, back around the time Franklin Roosevelt defeated Wendell Willkie, that the landscape was sprinkled with handymen. It was an honorable profession, almost like being a bus driver or school janitor. Every American neighborhood from St. Louis to New Orleans to Waterville had one or two.
When not working fixing porches, banisters, window sashes and cellar doors, one could be found up on a ladder somewhere or sitting in a corner table at the local diner, sipping soup or munching on the daily blue plate special. He had a universal costume -- old blue jeans or work khaki pants carried over from the last parts of his First or Second World War uniform.
Maybe he had a worn leather fading bomber jacket worn over a denim shirt, and he looked like an older Tommy Lee Jones, wearing that stained old fedora, slumped over a bowl of soup or standing on the corner, trying to light a Camel cigarette in the wind.
In my childhood, I knew such a man. His name was Barney, and he lived with his mother on the top floor of a two-family flat across the street from the Catholic church.
Barney walked with a slight limp favoring his right side. One of the firemen at the firehouse said it was because that's where he carried his tool box.
Mr. Schneider at the drug store said that Barney had lost the lower part of his right leg at Pearl Harbor, and that was sad, he said, because he had been a great baseball player in high school.
In the late '30s, when I was old enough to start being aware of things like that, there were men and boys everywhere to fix things. But then my father died without saying goodbye, and Pearl Harbor was bombed and suddenly the family handymen were gone. Then somewhere around 1944, Barney was there, limping down Soper Street with his tool box, and all the widows and blue and gold star mothers were hiring him to patch up their neglected homes.
It worked like this. If my mother got tired of stepping over the broken board on the back porch, she would send me up the street to Barney's house. I would knock on the door, and his mother, who worked for Father Keating across the street, would come to the door wiping her hands on her apron that had pictures of autumn leaves on it. You remember things like that when you're a strange, lonely little boy with no brothers around.
I would ask her then, "Is Barney home?" He never was. She would tell me where he was working in the neighborhood, or that he was having chili for lunch at Auel's cafe on the corner. Then I would go there and find him and tell him that my mother needed him.
He would listen to me and nod, and say he'd be over.
Sometimes he would give me the extra oyster crackers that came with his chili.
So here I am, some hundred years later, with a broken drawer and no Barney; and my brothers, who were always good at fixing things, are all gone to the other side.
I asked around today, and everyone said they were all busy plowing snow or painting a house or building one. If you have a Barney in your neighborhood, let me know. I'll walk over and see if he's home.

Full text:   closed by fire
An early morning fire at Boone's Fish House and Oyster Room on Portland's waterfront on Wednesday has temporarily closed the restaurant.
The seafood restaurant, on Custom House Wharf at 86 Commercial St., is expected to reopen on Saturday after some quick repairs, said manager Andre Gennitti.
The fire started around 4 a.m. in a wood frame around the restaurant's central fireplace, damaging the flooring around the fireplace and the floorboards on the second floor, Gennitti said.
"Our fireplace kind of went overboard," he said. "The smoke damage was so minor, and there was no actual fire damage. We will be able to get rolling soon."
Gennitti said the Portland Fire Department did a great job removing the floor, causing minimal damage. He said the flooring will have to be reinstalled and the restaurant will have to be cleaned and inspected before it can reopen.
"It could have been a lot worse," he said.
Boone's, owned by chef Harding Lee Smith, is Smith's fourth and newest restaurant in Portland. It opened in August with much anticipation in a sprawling, two-story space, with a dining room downstairs and raw bar upstairs. Smith opened The Front Room Restaurant & Bar on Congress Street in 2005. The Grill Room & Bar and The Corner Room Italian Kitchen & Bar, both on Exchange Street, followed in 2008 and 2009. Portland Fire Capt. Phil McGouldrick said his department has yet to complete a final report.
He described the damage as "minor to moderate."
The fire department was notified by a built-in fire alarm system at 4:03 a.m., and the first crews to respond reported back that there was smoke in the building, prompting a second "all hands" call for a working fire, McGouldrick said.
"The early notification of the built-in fire alarm system really helped us out. There's no downplaying the value of a working fire alarm system," he said, adding that firefighters put out the fire and left the restaurant by 7:44 a.m.

Full text:   ... A pas de deux
Yes, this is it. This is the "lesbian" movie your friends in the teachers' lounge and dinner parties have been whispering about, the one with the 15-minute halt-all engines blazing sex scene between two women. Actually, it's only eight minutes long, it just seems like 20 and is so graphic and intense that it threatens to frighten the horses.
When all is said and certainly done, it's a cold copulation, almost brutal, animalistic without tenderness, like watching mud wrestling with no mud. But still, beautifully shot, bodies, at climax, arraigned like Renoir dolls at rest. Like Scotch and oysters, this will appeal to some, bore others.
But there are two more grapplings and a lot of French kissing. After all, it is a French film, what did you expect, hands under the sweaters?
There is however, a lot more to this film. There are a few moments of tenderness, at least from one of the duo.
Taken from a graphic novel, the French title is "La vie d'Adele: Chapitres 1 et 2," and there is no intermission as in "Lawrence of Arabia."
The film won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival, the first one ever given not only to the director, Abdellatif Kechiche, but to the two leading actresses, Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux.
It should be said that it is being lauded by some critics as one of the most important films of the year. But then they tell that to all the girls, don't they?
As cinema, it's beautifully made, of course, and the two leads give startling performances, especially Adele.
Adele, whose last name is longer than the movie, is a creature of wood nymph beauty with a mouth created by Vermeer. It is Adele's story. She is the naif, the one you'll feel most for.
Adele is a 17-year-old high school student, a lovely inchoate lesbian with restless hair, eyes always on the brink of tears, and lips designed for trembling. Our Adele is clearly wrestling with her rumbling passions.
She makes furtive moves with a boy here and there, but we know where this is going when, one sunny day, a girl with roughly cut blue hair, sensual eyes and a tough turn to her mouth, passes Adele in the street. This will be Emma, Emma, who will haunt Adele's dreams.
That night Adele has the deep erotic dream. The rest is history.
Haunted by the passing moment, Adele seeks her out by cruising a gay bar at night. They chat, they smoke and sip and touch and the deal is sealed. The next day, blue-haired Emma, (Lea Seydoux) an aspiring painter, appears outside Adele's school yard, and they walk off together, leaving a clutch of mean girl friends to finish her reputation at school. Adele will become Emma's muse, lover and model.
The covert love affair blossoms. Each of the girls have dinner at their respective homes. Adele's parents, completely in the dark, are middle class nice and seem to have a passion for spaghetti Bolognese, there is frame after frame of all of them eating. Mom and dad are clueless to Adele's sexuality. Emma's parents, on the other hand, are rainbow embracing and are fully aware liberal nouveau intellects, with a taste for fine wines and raw oysters. Again, there is frame after countless frame of all sucking down raw oysters. Director Kechiche spends so much time here, it seems as if they're commercials for fine dining.
As four years plod slowly by, Adele matures by taming her hair and adapting glasses. She will become a teacher of small children, and gradually move up to higher grades, but still the watery eyes and trembling lips of youth remain.
Emma will lose the rebel blue hair and grow more cynical. Old lovers and friends will come back into her life, drawn like moths to the flame of her new success, and when Adele, feeling left out and behind, seeks comfort in a tryst with a male friend, a violent confrontation erupts.
"Blue is the Warmest Color" is, at almost three hours, much too long for a simple love story, which is what it is. I think that in the hands of a good woman director with a large scissors it would be a better picture.
Both women are gifted artists, and all the players are well cast. "Blue" will do well, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.

Abstract: An emailed version of that picture made its way to the headmaster's office and then the Maine Attorney General's Office, which determined that the 16-year-old driver of the car, which advertised a brand of e-cigarettes being imported and distributed by her family's business, was not breaking any laws by parking it on campus. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, between 2011 and 2012 the percentage of children in grades 6- through 12 who said they'd used the battery-operated cigarettes increased from 3.3 percent to 6.8 percent.

Full text:   Toby Simon had just dropped off her daughter at Thornton Academy in Saco when she noticed a white Kia Optima wrapped in an advertising banner for SmokeEnds e-cigarettes with the slogan "Your HABIT ... Made BETTER." A tobacco policy specialist, Simon was perturbed by the car's presence on campus. "I just kind of sat there for a while," she said. "Then I got out and took a picture."
An emailed version of that picture made its way to the headmaster's office and then the Maine Attorney General's Office, which determined that the 16-year-old driver of the car, which advertised a brand of e-cigarettes being imported and distributed by her family's business, was not breaking any laws by parking it on campus.
Some boundary had been crossed, though, of both school policy and social protocol. The girl's mother, Carrie Gorham, the founder of SmokeEnds, agreed that her daughter would park it off campus from now on. But the scenario typifies the gray area around e-cigarettes. In this tale of two mothers, Gorham sees them as the wave of the future and the lesser of two evils. Simon worries they represent another way for the tobacco industry to make a buck on nicotine addicts and find new, younger customers.
E-cigarettes have been available in the American marketplace for about five years and are, as Amber Desrosiers, the tobacco policy coordinator for Maine's attorney general, puts it, undeniably "up and coming." Movie star Leonardo DiCaprio has been photographed with one for years. Reported usage doubled between 2010 and 2011, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Annual sales are expected to top $1 billion this year.
However, the level of confusion around the battery-operated devices hasn't dissipated as they've moved beyond novelty, in no small part because the Federal Drug Administration has yet to issue regulations for e-cigarettes.
The long-term health effects are not yet clear, and neither are the societal aspects of using them. They look like cigarettes and they deliver a hit of nicotine, an alkaloid that raises blood pressure, but should the smoker duck outside a restaurant to use them, or push back from the table and have an e-cigarette with his coffee? In a television ad for Blu, the e-cigarette made by the tobacco company Lorillard, the actor Stephen Dorff promises you can light up a Blu "virtually everywhere." What he can't promise, legally, is that they will get you to quit nicotine; but the fact that he can espouse the virtues of e-cigarettes on television, where tobacco ads have been banned for decades, is yet another signifier of that gray area.
All this ambiguity is deeply frustrating to Ed Miller, spokesman for the American Lung Association's Maine chapter. "It's the Wild Wild West out there," he said.
The lung association's stance is that smoke-free laws should be applied to e-cigarettes, even if what comes out of them is vapor rather than secondhand smoke. Miller cites a German study that found trace amounts of formaldehyde and benzine in the vapor emissions. But while no one seems to be able to locate any definitive research, more people are discovering the products.
One of the key statistics that fuels Miller and Simon's concern and the nationwide debate about e-cigarettes is the increase in the number of middle and high school students who say they have tried them. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, between 2011 and 2012 the percentage of children in grades 6- through 12 who said they'd used the battery-operated cigarettes increased from 3.3 percent to 6.8 percent. And e-cigarettes come in such flavors as chocolate, orange, caramel and even, if you hunt for it online, something called Cap'n Crunch Berries.
"The e-cigarette industry is really taking its tactics from the cigarette industry on how it is marketing to the kids," Miller said. "It's ripped from Big Tobacco's playbook."
When it comes to that Smoke Ends car on the Thornton Academy campus, Carrie Gorham would disagree vehemently. Her reasons for letting her daughter drive the car to school had everything to do with convenience, not marketing.
"Are there are companies out there doing that?" she said. "Oh, my God, yes, and we combat them every single day."
If she were selling regular cigarettes and driving a car wrapped in, say, Marlboro advertisements, she never would have let her child drive it to school. But she feels so good about the business she started three years ago, shortly after throwing her last seven traditional cigarettes into a mud puddle, that she sometimes forgets that others might not feel the same way.
"We are trying to save people," Gorham said. "I feel that we are making a difference in this world." She tiptoes around the word "healthy," careful not to make promises she knows are false. "All I know is this is a far better alternative."
A former dog groomer, she was spurred to start the Kennebunk-based business by the death of her former mother-in-law. "She died of a massive heart attack at 62 with a cigarette in her mouth," Gorham said. During that time, when Gorham was heartbroken and disgusted with her own "horrible" habit, her husband, Steve, introduced her to e-cigarettes. She liked one brand but found them hard to find and decided that she wanted to go into the distribution business herself.
Eventually that led to trademarking her own brand and working with a factory in China, where the first e-cigarettes were produced. Now they have several employees, including Carrie's brother John Graham, and seven cars in the SmokeEnds fleet. Most of them, Gorham points out, are hybrids. She worries about the environment. She cares about cancer victims. She said she raised $500 for a breast cancer patient who needed wigs by selling e-cigarettes with a pink cartridge. Her customers are grateful. "People are so excited," she said. "It's like a breath of fresh air to still smoke but without all the bad crap."
While it's true that e-cigarettes don't contain tar, they do contain nicotine - otherwise they'd do nothing for the person with the chemical addiction to the tobacco product. A battery in an e-cigarette fires a heating coil, which warms a liquid containing nicotine. When the user inhales, it produces a nicotine vapor.
Demonstrating, Gorham exhales out her nose like a practiced cigarette smoker, but there's more of a sense of something light passing through the air than an actual smell. She calls it smoking - old habits - but the industry name for what you do with an e-cigarette is "vaping."
The FDA's proposed regulations on e-cigarettes were expected in October, but the government shutdown slowed that process, and an FDA spokeswoman said the agency can't speculate on timing. In September, Maine Attorney General Janet T. Mills joined with 39 other state and territorial attorneys general in calling for the FDA to place restrictions on them by classifying them as "tobacco products" under the Tobacco Control Act. This would limit the advertising and marketing of e-cigarettes to youth.
As the CDC noted in its report on the use of e-cigarettes by people under 18, there are other components in the e-cigarettes, including a component to produce the aerosol, which could be propylene glycol or glycerol. In addition, the CDC report said "potentially harmful constituents also have been documented in some e-cigarette cartridges, including irritants, genotoxins, and animal carcinogens." These ingredients are untested and vary from one product to another.
"The consumer has no idea what's in there," Miller said. The flavorings are another factor. For Miller, they are a clear indication that the industry, which produces 200 to 250 brands, is catering to a youthful market.
Carrie Gorham doesn't see it that way. As she vaped from an orange-flavored cartridge at a Scarborough restaurant, she said she favors a flavored e-cigarette because her taste buds, damaged from years of smoking regular cigarettes, crave a flavor agent.
Her vaping went unnoticed by a waitress and the rest of the staff, which local restaurateurs say is common.
At Foreplay in Portland, bar manager Jeff Nappi said he'd hardly seen anyone using e-cigarettes in the bar in recent years. There's one regular who used them for a while, he said, but that person went outside to do so. At J's Oyster, a waitress who vapes also goes outside. E-cigarettes have not been a factor at DiMillo's restaurant, except for one server who uses them in public areas.
"It raises some eyebrows, but in my opinion doesn't ruffle too many feathers," owner Johnny DiMillo wrote in an email. "I wouldn't deter any of our diners from using these devices any more than the occasional obnoxious kid with a beeping and buzzing cell phone or iPad totally disengaged from the rest of their dining group."
But the lack of direction from the FDA leaves business owners unclear on how to proceed.
"I was wondering what I would say if someone pulled one out at Becky's," said Becky Rand, whose Becky's Diner is a popular waterfront destination. "Don't they produce a vapor? For people who haven't heard of them, there are going to be some questions." Her inclination is to ask e-cigarette users to step outside, but she has sympathy for smokers "because they are addicted, and it is just the way the cigarette companies want them to be," she said.
She struggled to keep both her smoking customers and her nonsmoking customers happy in the days before Portland eliminated indoor smoking, she said. Being banished outside wasn't popular with the smokers, but "they are used to being second-class citizens on this issue," she said.
Gorham would agree with this. "We haven't been citizens of the United States for 10 years," she said.
And then, once more, over pizza and in public, she vaped.

Full text:   Toby Simon had just dropped off her daughter at Thornton Academy in Saco when she noticed a white Kia Optima wrapped in an advertising banner for SmokeEnds e-cigarettes with the slogan "Your HABIT ... Made BETTER." A tobacco policy specialist, Simon was perturbed by the car's presence on campus. "I just kind of sat there for a while," she said. "Then I got out and took a picture."
An emailed version of that picture made its way to the headmaster's office and then the Maine Attorney General's Office, which determined that the 16-year-old driver of the car, which advertised a brand of e-cigarettes being imported and distributed by her family's business, was not breaking any laws by parking it on campus.
Some boundary had been crossed, though, of both school policy and social protocol. The girl's mother, Carrie Gorham, the founder of SmokeEnds, agreed that her daughter would park it off campus from now on. But the scenario typifies the gray area around e-cigarettes. In this tale of two mothers, Gorham sees them as the wave of the future and the lesser of two evils. Simon worries they represent another way for the tobacco industry to make a buck on nicotine addicts and find new, younger customers.
E-cigarettes have been available in the American marketplace for about five years and are, as Amber Desrosiers, the tobacco policy coordinator for Maine's attorney general, puts it, undeniably "up and coming." Movie star Leonardo DiCaprio has been photographed with one for years. Reported usage doubled between 2010 and 2011, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Annual sales are expected to top $1 billion this year.
However, the level of confusion around the battery-operated devices hasn't dissipated as they've moved beyond novelty, in no small part because the Federal Drug Administration has yet to issue regulations for e-cigarettes.
The long-term health effects are not yet clear, and neither are the societal aspects of using them. They look like cigarettes and they deliver a hit of nicotine, an alkaloid that raises blood pressure, but should the smoker duck outside a restaurant to use them, or push back from the table and have an e-cigarette with his coffee? In a television ad for Blu, the e-cigarette made by the tobacco company Lorillard, the actor Stephen Dorff promises you can light up a Blu "virtually everywhere." What he can't promise, legally, is that they will get you to quit nicotine; but the fact that he can espouse the virtues of e-cigarettes on television, where tobacco ads have been banned for decades, is yet another signifier of that gray area.
All this ambiguity is deeply frustrating to Ed Miller, spokesman for the American Lung Association's Maine chapter. "It's the Wild Wild West out there," he said.
The lung association's stance is that smoke-free laws should be applied to e-cigarettes, even if what comes out of them is vapor rather than secondhand smoke. Miller cites a German study that found trace amounts of formaldehyde and benzine in the vapor emissions. But while no one seems to be able to locate any definitive research, more people are discovering the products.

According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, between 2011 and 2012 the percentage of children in grades 6- through 12 who said they'd used the battery-operated cigarettes increased from 3.3 percent to 6.8 percent. And e-cigarettes come in such flavors as chocolate, orange, caramel and even, if you hunt for it online, something called Cap'n Crunch Berries.
"The e-cigarette industry is really taking its tactics from the cigarette industry on how it is marketing to the kids," Miller said. "It's ripped from Big Tobacco's playbook."

Full text:   Travelin Mainers column visit Long Grain restaurant in Camden and visit the Samoset for the 5 millionth time. Many pix and If You Go nugget
abound at Samoset Resort
Last year's spectacular soldout ice bar and lounge was such a success at the Samoset Resort that they've extended the event to two weekends this winter, Jan. 16 -19 and 23-25. After experiencing their inaugural ice bar event last year, we'll be sure to return. You really have to see it to believe it.
Picture yourself at an ice table, with a Warmed Baked Apple handcrafted cocktail and a half dozen chilled oysters in front of you, with a full moon splashing light over the ocean. Wow! This is the life. The bar itself is a work of art, not to be missed. and also offers nonalcoholic beverages, including Grandma's hot chocolate and several tasty food choices including Caprese Kabobs. If you go for both weekends, you may be able to try them all!
For those who prefer their cocktails in a warm room, the Samoset's elegant Enoteca Lounge is just a few steps away and has a roaring fire in case you got more chilly than desired at the ice bar. But really, you should take a seat out there for the full experience. It's something you'll never forget.
After closing for a few winters, it was good to see the Samoset reopen for the winter last year. We vacationed here with our kids when they were small, and the resort has substantially increased activities since that time. Our winter getaway here last year included a vigorous health class workout, time at the pool and skating rink with one of our grandsons, an awesome evening at the ice bar and dinner at the resort's wonderful Italian restaurant, La Bella Vita.
For our recent weekend in the Rockland/Camden area, we luxuriated in a third-floor corner room overlooking the Rockland breakwater in one direction and the open ocean in the other. As I was writing this, Linda stepped out of the bathroom and said, "I could spend the entire weekend in that shower!" Yes, everything at the Samoset Resort is extra special!

Full text:   Portland Press Herald
Food safety inspections at Maine's seafood processing plants are delayed by a few weeks because of the federal government shutdown, state officials said. They also said if the shuttering persists, it could cause more severe problems with the annual seafood inspection program.
"It has so far had a minimal impact on us. If it went on for too long, we would have to analyze what we could do," said Ron Dyer, director of quality assurance and regulations at the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
As part of the sweeping Food and Drug Administration food safety program, the FDA contracts with Maine, and the state performs 32 unannounced safety inspections per year at Maine's approximately 40 seafood processing plants. Maine receives about $800 for each inspection, or nearly $26,000 per year from the FDA. The U.S. Department of Agriculture inspects meat, poultry and egg products, while the FDA inspects seafood and all other food products.
The FDA works with Maine to schedule eight inspections per quarter. Because 2013's fourth quarter started Oct. 1, the same day that the federal government shutdown began, the fall and winter schedule has not been set.
"We have been in limbo since then," Dyer said.
Dyer said he's not sure if the state would be permitted to temporarily pick up the cost of the program if the shutdown continues. He said once the federal government reopens, the seafood inspections could begin late this year or simply be shifted to the beginning of 2014. Dyer said the state may do abbreviated inspections of the seafood processing plants in the interim, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.
While seafood inspections have been delayed a few weeks, meat and poultry inspections continue unabated, Dyer said, because they fall under the USDA program. Meat inspectors were considered essential employees under the shutdown and continued working, Dyer said.
Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate failed to agree to a deal by Tuesday evening, according to news reports, although speculation that a bipartisan Senate-led deal would break the impasse seemed to indicate the end of the partisan wrangling was near. If a deal is not brokered by Thursday, when the debt ceiling is reached, it could damage credibility in financial markets, raising doubt that the U.S. pays its bills, according to numerous news reports.
Among the myriad problems caused by the shutdown are furloughs of employees related to food safety that could haunt the U.S. if allowed to continue, said Amanda Hitt, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Food Integrity Campaign, a nonprofit watchdog group.
Hitt said that while the meat, poultry and egg inspectors so far have been considered essential employees, furloughing back-office USDA employees eventually could snarl operations, such as the ability to deliver labels, including recall labels for contaminated food.
Hitt said so far the food supply is not being jeopardized to a substantial degree, but if the shutdown continues, the U.S. could be heading into dangerous territory.
"We do not want to roll the dice with the safety of the U.S. food supply," Hitt said. "One little hiccup could lead to quite a disaster. You could have the possibility for massive illnesses."
While the USDA retained its meat inspectors during the shutdown, the FDA furloughed 45 percent of its employees, some of whom are involved in food safety, according to government documents.
According to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services memo, "routine establishment" inspections of food industry facilities are suspended during the shutdown.
"The FDA will be unable to support the majority of its food safety, nutrition, and cosmetics activities. FDA will also have to cease safety activities such as routine establishment inspections, some compliance and enforcement activities, monitoring of imports, notification programs (e.g., food contact substances, infant formula), and the majority of the laboratory research necessary to inform public health decision-making," according to the memo.
The memo noted, however, that nearly 700 FDA employees related to food safety inspections would remain on the job during the shutdown.
In one example of how inspections can affect the seafood industry, the FDA temporarily shut down Portland Shellfish Co. in 2011 and 2012 for safety violations, and required the company to improve sanitary conditions.

Associated Press
WASHINGTON -- A month before he went on the rampage that left 13 dead, Washington Navy Yard gunman Aaron Alexis complained to police in Rhode Island that people were talking to him through the walls and ceilings of his hotel rooms and sending microwave vibrations into his body to deprive him of sleep.
The account, contained in an Aug. 7 report from Newport, R.I., police, adds to the picture that has emerged of an agitated and erratic figure whose behavior and mental state had repeatedly come to authorities' attention but didn't seem to affect his security clearance.
Alexis, a 34-year-old information technology employee at a defense-related computer company, used a valid pass Monday to get into the Navy Yard and killed 12 people before he was slain by police in a shootout that lasted more than a half-hour.
A day after the assault, the motive was still a mystery. U.S. law enforcement officials told The Associated Press that investigators had found no manifesto or other writings suggesting a political or religious motivation.
Alexis, a former Navy reservist, had been undergoing mental health treatment from Veterans Affairs since August but was not stripped of his security clearance, according to the law enforcement officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the criminal investigation was still going on.
He had been suffering a host of serious mental problems, including paranoia and a sleep disorder, and had been hearing voices in his head, the officials said.
The assault is raising more questions about the adequacy of the background checks done on contract employees who hold security clearances -- an issue that came up recently with National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.
Navy Secretary Ray Mabus ordered two security reviews Tuesday of how well the Navy protects its bases and how accurately it screens its workers.
Similarly, President Barack Obama has ordered the White House budget office to examine security standards for government contractors and employees across federal agencies.
In addition, the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees asked the VA for details about any treatment provided to Alexis.
At the U.S. Navy Memorial, in church and on the baseball field, the nation's capital paused to mourn the victims. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel laid a wreath at the memorial's "Lone Sailor" statue as taps played.
Just a few blocks from the Navy Yard, the Washington Nationals were back to playing baseball after their Monday night game with the Atlanta Braves was postponed because of the shooting. The Nationals wore blue and gold Navy caps during warm-ups, and a moment of silence was held before the first pitch.
Those killed included: Michael Arnold, 59, a Navy veteran and avid pilot who was building a light airplane at home; Sylvia Frasier, 53, who worked in computer security; Frank Kohler, 50, a former Rotary Club president in Lexington Park, Md., who proudly reigned as "King Oyster" at the annual seafood festival; and marine engineer and naval architect Vishnu Pandit, 61, an Indian immigrant.
In the Newport, R.I., incident, Alexis told police he got into an argument with someone as he was getting on a flight from Virginia to Rhode Island, where he was working as a naval contractor, and he said the person sent three people to follow and harass him.
He said he heard voices talking to him through a wall while at one hotel, so he changed hotels twice, but the voices followed him, according to the report. He said he feared they might harm him.
He also "stated that the individuals are using 'some sort of microwave machine' to send vibrations through the ceiling, penetrating his body so he cannot fall asleep."
Later that day, Newport police alerted the Rhode Island naval station and sent a copy of the police report, Newport police Lt. William Fitzgerald said Thursday.
A spokeswoman for the station had no comment Tuesday.
Alexis came to the Washington area about two weeks later and had been staying at hotels. On Saturday, two days before the attack, he went to a Virginia gun store about 15 miles from the Navy Yard.
He rented a rifle, bought bullets and took target practice at Sharpshooters Small Arms Range, the store's attorney Michael Slocum said. Alexis then bought a shotgun and 24 shells, according to Slocum.
The FBI said during Monday's attack Alexis was armed with a shotgun. Officials said he also took a handgun from a law officer.
Alexis had run-ins with the law in 2004 and 2010 in Texas and Seattle after he was accused of firing a gun in anger. He was not prosecuted in either case.
And his bouts of insubordination, disorderly conduct and being absent from work without authorization prompted the Navy to grant him an early -- but honorable -- discharge in 2011 after nearly four years as a full-time reservist, authorities said.
Alexis joined the Florida-based IT consulting firm The Experts in September 2012, leaving a few months later to return to school. He came back in June to do part-time work at the Washington Navy Yard as a subcontractor, helping the military update computer systems.
The Experts' CEO, Thomas Hoshko, said that Alexis had "no personal issues," and he confirmed that Alexis had been granted a "secret" clearance by the Defense Security Service five years ago.
Alexis' clearance -- lower than "top secret" -- doesn't need to be renewed for 10 years. Still, the company said it hired outside vendors twice to check Alexis' criminal history.
Alexis' background check "came back clear," Hoshko said.

Full text:   It was the perfect ending to a wonderful
summer: a week in Lubec, dinner at the Water Street Tavern (our favorite restaurant there) and an exciting whale-watching adventure with Campobello's Island Cruises.
George
We've got this down now, our very special end-of-summer treat. A week at Catherine Mettey's Lubec Bay Cottage, where we gather as many family members as we can, a memorable feast at the Water Street Tavern, hikes along the cliffs of the West Quoddy Head Lighthouse, astonishingly close looks at whales, an enjoyable concert by Lubec's Summer Keys program and several visits to Monica's Chocolates, punctuated on the way home by a stop at the American Folk Festival in Bangor. The only downside: When we finally get home, summer is over.
This year, daughter Rebekah and grandson Vishal joined us for two days, while daughter Hilary, who lives in Washington, D.C., and her friend Dani arrived mid-week -- in time to participate in this column. Here's what they had to say:
Dani
Ever been so close to a whale you can smell its breath? This is how close Island Cruises on Campobello Island will get you. Few things in life are as exciting as they look in movies, but this particular tour took our breath away. Seeing a whale blow just 30 yards from your boat, almost feeling the spray on your face, is much more captivating than watching Planet Earth.
When we found our first well-fed finback, we stuck with her for quite some time, her reappearance never failing to thrill. We watched in childlike wonder as miles of whale would pass by before her fin would even break the water's surface.
After about 20 minutes of stalking our whale, we found that some of the porpoises we'd seen were now stalking us! They circled the boat a few times and playfully raced alongside it like my Husky does when she wants to show off how fast she can outrun me. Just when I thought we might get bored, we spotted a friendly seal here and there.
But I knew the trip would be successful when, at the very first turn, a bald eagle soared directly overhead and landed on the branch of a spruce already occupied by another adult eagle. We were so close we could hear them screeching back and forth.
Hilary
Dinner at the Water Street Tavern is bound to wake up anyone from a restful vacation in this this quiet coastal town. Everything is vibrant here -- from the service to the wine to the food. But perhaps what is liveliest are the guests. Happy to be surrounded by like-minded vacationers, the locals and tourists alike will visit with you, cheerfully take your picture and share insider secrets about the best items on the menu.
With the help of owner Jim Heyer, we selected some real gems for food and wine -- Prisoner Zinfandel from Napa Valley, a fried oyster special of the day and "black and blue" haddock preparation with lump crab cakes as a garnish!
Dani loved the slightly sweet coleslaw, which is prepared fresh every day with a hint of pineapple, and her oysters (which were melt-in-your-mouth tender) almost as much as she enjoyed the white chocolate blueberry cheesecake, which was both creamy and very light.
I was partial to the seafood stew -- with a hearty helping of lobster and sweet, tender haddock -- and the smoky, spicy haddock entree. The fish was dredged in a dry rub featuring chipotle chili powder, as were the crab cakes, and both were fiery and flavorful. I must mention the accompanying green beans with roasted garlic because such crispy, bright green beans are rare in even the fanciest restaurants in Washington.
George
Well, Hilary would know about the beans, because she's a server in one of Washington's best restaurants. After returning to Mount Vernon on Sunday, I reversed course with brother Gordon and drove back to Lubec to spend some time with our 90-year-old uncle, Philip Searles, who was visiting from his home in Alabama. Phil was born in the West Quoddy Head Lighthouse, and we really enjoyed riding around the area while he told us stories about our ancestors and others.
Wanting to give Phil and his friend Gladys a real treat, Gordon and I took them to the Water Street Tavern for dinner. Having enjoyed my favorite dish there, the Moqueca (Brazilian Seafood Stew) the previous week, I opted for Hilary's choice, the Black & Blue Haddock with two crab cakes on top. Gordon did, too, and we are both still raving about it.
It's not surprising that the dish is so good, because Jim Heyer came up with it after spending a couple of hours with world-famous chef Paul Prudholm. Jim's connections from his days as a national wine/beer salesman help make his menu -- and his unique selection of wines -- very special.
I overheard a couple nearby giving advice to a single lady at the table next to us about Maine's St. George Peninsula and Monhegan -- where she was headed next -- and was amused when they invited the lady to join them at their table. When the gentleman came over to our table (after noticing us taking photographs) and offered to take a photo of all of us, we discovered that he and his wife were from Silver Springs, Maryland. So here we had tourists giving another tourist advice about our state. Wonderful! And then we got another surprise when we learned that the couple's son is a chef at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. where Hilary once worked.
Everywhere we went in Lubec and Campobello, I would introduce Phil and people would ask if he knew any of their ancestors. And he always did. Sure enough, at the tavern, server Julie's parents were local farmers that Phil knew well. He knew the uncles of the U.S. Customs border agent, too, and that caused a bit of a delay in crossing the border as the agent and Phil traded stories.
But it was when Phil was introduced to Robert, the guide on our Island Cruises whale-watching adventure, that I really got a sense of what a small interconnected community Lubec and Campobello is. Phil's father (my grandfather) was from Campobello and Robert not only knew all of our relatives there, but he played in a band with one of them. The stories flew as we motored out to the islands they call the "wolves," where we got up close to many amazing finbacks, the second largest whale in the world. They came up two and three together, right next to the boat. For almost two hours we were surrounded and entertained by whales. Wow!

As if Maine summers could get any shorter.
This year's got off to a soggy start with a rained-out Memorial Day weekend, and then there was the seventh wettest June on record.
As Labor Day marks the symbolic end of the season, Mainers are trying to make the most of the fleeting heat -- despite the flying pollen -- by spicing up their ice cream, slurping down oysters and standing up on paddleboards. Sound strange? When you look at the numbers, this summer has actually been pretty typical.
The average daily temperature was 67.7 degrees, about a degree above normal, and there were 50 fatalities on the state's roads -- nine fewer than last year and six more than the year before.
Lodging and restaurant sales were up from last year, but not quite as high as was hoped, said Greg Dugal, executive director of the Maine Innkeepers Association.
After a dip in the hotel occupancy rate for June (he blames the rain), it was back up to 71 percent for July, slightly above the same month last year, according to Smith Travel Report.
Turnpike traffic was also down in June but rebounded the next month, when 7.9 million tolls were paid -- up by about 18,000 from last year, according to the Maine Turnpike Authority.
Although the precipitation drew down the number of visitors, it played a role in raising a different figure: the pollen count.
Higher peaks than previous years were caused by "some magic combination of rain and heat," said Paul Shapero, an allergist in Bangor. He saw more people than ever who had never had allergies before.
And those weren't the only noxious things in the air this summer. Mosquitoes were also in abundance as a result of the rain.
Mike Russo, president of Maine Mosquito & Pest Services in Portland, said he had a 55 percent increase in mosquito customers over last year. That doesn't include the houses he had to spray again, after treatments got washed away by yet another storm.
He does attribute part of the business boom to the buzz around mosquito-borne illnesses. Though no mosquito pools were known to carry West Nile Virus, compared to the five that had tested positive by this time last year, a deadlier disease -- Eastern equine encephalitis - was detected four times.
Speaking of bugs, as in the big red ones, lobster prices were almost as low as last year, when Canadian fishermen blocked truckloads of Maine-caught lobsters from being delivered to processing plants.
The wholesale price of about $2.80 a pound in southern Maine last month didn't succeed in inciting our neighbors to the north, but indicates there's been more than enough to go around.
Still, this summer, the state's iconic sea creature had nothing on a bivalve that whole bars were built around.
Maine oysters, alongside octopus from Spain, were the hottest-selling seafood, both in-state and nationally, for Portland-based Browne Trading Co., said marketing director Nick Branchina.
He pointed to the opening of Portland restaurants Eventide Oyster Co. last year and Boone's Fish House and Oyster Room last month as more evidence of the trend.
Turns out people will eat anything with a splash of Tabasco sauce. This summer, that probably included ice cream.
Thai chili and chocolate wasabi -- flavors that people stuck out their tongues at just a couple of years ago -- were flying out of the barrels this summer at Mount Desert Island Ice Cream's stores in Portland and Bar Harbor, said owner Linda Parker.
At the Portland farmers market, it was garlic scapes -- the plant's curly green stems you couldn't give away last year -- that got their time in the sun, said Will Troy of the Frith Farm in Scarborough. They're only available for a couple of weeks in June, and, apparently, make for a good pesto.
Now, after all that food, wait 30 minutes.
It's time for the beach.
State parks were more packed than usual this summer. In July, Crescent Beach in Cape Elizabeth saw a 58 percent increase in attendance over last year, with 40,910 visitors.
More than a few likely came with their stand-up paddleboards - an item that finally made its way into the L.L.Bean catalog this year, starting at a cool $769, and has been "immensely popular," said spokeswoman Carolyn Beem.
Unlike surfing, waves aren't required for this water sport. Nor is much skill.
But don't pass it over as a passing fad. People could be riding these things right into the fall.
In fact, according to everyone, it's not time for summer to end yet. Mother Nature at least has to make up for that seventh-wettest June. Perhaps with the sixth-warmest September?
Maybe don't put away those white pants just yet.

AUGUSTA -- As part of Maine's efforts to expand markets for lobster, Gov. Paul LePage on Monday sent a box of Maine lobster products to each of the 49 other state governors across the country.
"What better time than summer to share the iconic Maine lobster?" LePage said.
Boxes full of items such as prepared lobster meat, frozen tails, bisques and spreads from Maine processors and dealers were shipped overnight.
The governor announced plans to send the promotional boxes earlier this month. The packages did not include live lobsters, given the logistical challenges of sending live shellfish across the country, a spokesman said.
The $5,000 promotion, which covered the cost of the lobster products and shipping, was funded by the governor's contingency fund, according to Jeff Nichols, spokesman for the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
The state invited all Maine lobster processors to participate, and some items were donated. The shipment coincided with August being Maine Lobster Month.
"The lobster industry is vital to Maine's economy and its identity," LePage said.
The lobster industry, Maine's largest fishery, has been suffering from record catches and weak prices. Last year, Maine lobstermen hauled a record 123 million pounds of lobster, up 18 percent from 2012. The total value of the catch, however, dropped 1.1 percent, to $331 million.
To combat weak prices, the state has planned a $2 million marketing effort, led by the new Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative, to promote Maine lobster around the country and internationally. Maine also has been trying to expand its lobster-processing capacity so that more can be processed in-state rather than in Canada, which handles most of the industry's processing.
"This fishery is as healthy as it is due in large part to the sustainable harvesting practices pioneered by Maine lobstermen," LePage said. "These longstanding practices are why the Maine lobster fishery earned the prestigious Marine Stewardship Council's sustainability certification."
Sustainable seafood certification, which recognizes ecologically sound practices from harvest to consumer, will boost the marketing of Maine lobster, the Department of Marine Resources has previously said.
Maine is the largest supplier of lobster in the country.
"Maine lobster is not just a Maine product; it's a U.S. product," said LePage. "Eighty-five percent of seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported, so I also see this as an opportunity to encourage my colleagues to support a strong U.S. economy."
In addition to the lobster products, the packages from LePage included recipes and information from the Maine Lobster Promotion Council.

YARMOUTH -- They sprout each year in neat little rows along Main Street, sometimes in pairs, seldom alone, lined up arm to arm.
For weeks before the first helpless bivalve is breaded and deep-fried, the Yarmouth Clam Festival preparations begin with an invasion of lawn chairs that line the Friday night parade route.
"We've seen chairs out in January and February, just to remind people that summer's coming," said Yarmouth Town Manager Nat Tupper, tongue planted in cheek. "Every year, it grows."
This weekend, before as many as 100,000 hungry visitors descend on the temporary wooden stalls, carnival rides and craft fairs that have made the charitable festival a raving success for nearly half a century, local residents have taken to staking their clam-festival claims earlier and earlier.
There are reclining chairs and beach chairs; chairs of plastic and chairs of wood; folding chairs and camping chairs; plaid chairs and chairs with stripes. Some chairs sport cup-holders, while some are armless. Chairs sit nestled in the shade; chairs are tied to telephone poles or lashed to other chairs baking in the sun.
Miniature chairs await miniature parade-goers. Some chairs are upside down; other chairs have name tags. Everywhere, chairs, chairs, chairs.
The ritual of marking one's territory with lawn furniture is neither unique to Yarmouth nor particularly unusual, yet residents here have a deep respect for the unwritten code of chair civility, with hundreds of people following the golden rule of parade seating: Don't mess with my chair, and we won't mess with yours.
"If (the town) held off on letting people put (out) chairs, there'd be chaos," said Mark Harlow, 41, a longtime Yarmouth resident and parade-goer. "I think there is method to this madness. It's been an ongoing joke for years."
Michael Leonard, who teaches photography and photo editing in his spare time and helps produce advertising material for the festival, took the gag one step further. During a snowy February day, Leonard set out some seats, waited for the powder to accumulate, and started snapping pictures.
The joke seats were out there for "no less than four hours, and people roll down their windows and say it's too early for the parade," Leonard said. "I knew I was onto something."
Now he sells prints of those pictures at frame shops in town, although he said photos of the sun-drenched festival have been better sellers.
There are analogous practices, like the seat-saving at the seasonal L.L. Bean concerts. Concert-goers and sports fans engage in some of the same rites and rituals. After snowstorms in Boston, where narrow streets become parking quagmires, spaces are saved with sometimes-unusual inanimate objects. But none of those practices are as visible, or as lengthy, as Yarmouth's.
Tupper has grown to accept the shenanigans as part of the tradition. He said he even likes to traipse the parade route, dumping any rainwater from the vinyl seats before the crowds arrive.
"I try to make myself useful," he said.
While the weekend festival draws hordes of outsiders, the chairs also serve to mark the locals' claim to the parade as their own celebration.
Not every chair belongs to a Yarmouth resident, however.
Pamela Dean, 59, of Xenia, Ohio, was helping her sister, who lives in Freeport, make room for a few more seats outside of the Dunkin' Donuts on Main Street on Tuesday. She was introduced to the ritual last summer and said she was shocked that the chairs did not draw more vandalism or thefts.
"I said, 'You're going to put chairs up and no one bothers them?'" recounting a conversation with her sister, Jackie Empey, who was nearby labeling with masking tape and a sharpie her family's plot. "If they did this in Xenia, there'd be no chairs left," Dean said.
Camilla Shannon, who was walking the parade route with her 2-year-old son, Henry, said that when she moved to Maine a few years ago, she didn't understand the rush for reserved seats.
But after enjoying the family-friendly atmosphere as a Portland resident and then moving later to Yarmouth, she understands the obsession.
"It's so woven into the community at this point," Shannon said. "It would be like missing the Fourth of July."

PORTLAND -- Drastically reducing carbon emissions would likely slow the effects of climate change and its negative impact on the Gulf of Maine lobster industry, leaders of the Maine environmental, scientific and business communities said Tuesday.
The negative effects, which include rising water temperature and increased acidification in the Gulf of Maine, and disease and life-cycle changes in lobsters and other shellfish, have raised concerns about the state's most lucrative fishery, environmental advocates said.
Officials the Natural Resources Council of Maine and marine scientist Rick Wahle, a University of Maine zoologist in the School of Marine Sciences, and representatives of the Maine Lobster Council, Ready Seafood Co. and the Maine Restaurant Association, launched a campaign Tuesday to raise awareness about the economic value of the state's lobster fishery and the challenges it faces.
"There is a problem. We are beginning to see the effects of climate change in the Gulf of Maine," said Emmie Theberge, clean-energy outreach coordinator for the resources council. "And the oceans are more sensitive to climate change."
So far, one of the biggest problems for the Maine lobster industry has been its own success. While lobster fisheries in southern New England are languishing, those in the Gulf of Maine are thriving as lobsters abandon warmer water as far south as Long Island Sound and move north, marine biologists have documented.
The surge in lobster numbers in the Gulf of Maine has led to an oversupply, which last year caused the per-pound price at the pier to dip as low as $2.50 in some areas. Partly in response to that, an aggressive new marketing campaign, funded by $2 million a year in state money, is attempting to open untapped global markets for Maine lobsters. Tuesday's news conference was part of that campaign.
But the lobster glut in the Gulf of Maine is no reason for complacence, marine biologists have warned.
Lobsters here have shown negative reaction to warming water temperatures and ocean acidification, particularly through early shedding in recent years and migrating north to colder water, said Wahle. Disease and parasites could become a problem, if climate changed is not slowed by reductions in carbon-dioxide emissions. In southern waters, lobsters have developed a disease that causes their shells to slowly disintegrate.
"I don't want to paint too rosy a picture," he said.
Because the problems facing the industry appear to be primarily related to climate change stemming from human activity, the group underscored the need for Mainers and legislative leaders to lobby for passage of President Barack Obama's carbon reduction plan. The plan, released last week, calls for drastic reductions in carbon emissions nationally. Carbon pollution from burning coal, oil and gas in power plants accounts for roughly 40 percent of all U.S. carbon emissions.
"Maine can't solve this problem alone," Theberge said.
The public information campaign was launched in anticipation of the Fourth of July holiday, and was designed to demonstrate how important the lobster is to Maine's identity, history, economy and seacoast communities. The lobster industry contributed $338 million to the state's economy in 2012 and employs 3,000 full-time and 2,500 part-time lobstermen.
The group held the news conference at Portland Lobster Co. restaurant on the Portland waterfront.
"We love and depend on lobsters," said Theberge. "Lobster is tied to Maine's very identity."

Full text:   Back down home, somewhere on the Mississippi River on the Arkansas state line, is where the very young writer/director Jeff Nichols ("Shotgun Stories," "Take Shelter") grew up -- and it's obvious. I grew up nearby in Missouri, and I can tell you that in "Mud" that's the river, and those are the poor southern Scotch-Irish, full of dreams and absent a plan. These are folks who don't live on the edge, but far below it on the rocks of calamity canyon.
"Mud" is a coming-of-age story about two boys, Tom and Huck -- well, a modern variation. It's Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) and their river, their dirt bike, flat bottom boat, their strip malls and hillbilly high school. They are surrounded by the danger of low expectations, bottom-line education and a future that pales with each setting sun.
Ellis' mom and pop are poor folks with good hearts (a very good Ray McKinnon and Sarah Paulson).
Neckbone is a discarded soul, being raised by his uncle (Michael Shannon) who ekes out a living by scouring the river bottom for what appear to be oysters.
True to Twain and the lore of the river, the boys go off on their adventure to motor out to an island in the middle of the river where they know a boat, thrown by floods and storms, is high up in a tree, like a tree house. They have big plans for this boat, but there's another fella who has his own plans and that would be "Mud," played to bottom-mud perfection by Matthew McConaughey.
Mud, they discover, is on the run, been on it since he went and killed a bad guy in Texas who was nasty to Mud's childhood sweetie, Juniper (Reese Witherspoon.) We soon learn that Juniper has passed around her favors in every juke joint from Arkansas to Amarillo and back to home.
But now both lovers are back in the hometown, with Juniper in a motel waiting for a call, and Mud up in his island treehouse boat, trying to stay out of sight of the lawmen who are blocking the highways out of town.
To add to his worries, the papa of his victim (old-time backwoods icon Joe Don Baker) has arrived in town with his own posse of low-lifers on his payroll. Papa has no need for the law -- he's rich and vengeful and has come for blood.
Thus, with everyone out looking for Mud, and unaware that he's out on that island with a bonfire each night, we're looking at a down-south "Great Expectations." Mud is our accidental killer with a big heart and he suckers the boys, who have fallen in love with this wild and crazy no-good hero, into bringing him more food and parts to get the boat going, so he can cruise down to the Gulf and off to Mexico.
Tall Tom Blankenship, a mysterious loner (a great and welcome Sam Shepard) folds in here as an old friend of Mud, who lives across the river from Ellis. Mud tells the wide-eyed boys that Tom went to Yale, and was a sniper assassin for the CIA. Mud is given to tall tales, but that sniper story will come into fruition in the finale.
Director Nichols fleshes out the plot with the boys aiding and abetting, stealing parts and equipment from local junkyards, running notes back and forth from the motel to the island and generally trying to add their own paragraphs to the growing legend and great escape of our flawed hero.
Nichols' script is tinted with bits of Tennessee Williams, Mark Twain and old John Ford river sunsets. His Juniper, Witherspoon, isn't really bad enough for the sweetheart-gone-wrong part. It's my secret idea that Jennifer Lawrence would have gotten it right. Reese just looks like she was in town for a photo op and got the job. She barely works up an acting sweat.
The boys are clearly at the heart of the story, and Nichols lucked out with them both. Sheridan ("Tree of Life"), as Ellis, is a born actor with a career waiting to happen.
His heavy emotional scenes with his parents, and with McConaughey, show a sharp inchoate talent.
In his very first part, Lofland, as "Neckbone" seems to have just stepped out of a strip mall drugstore in Arkansas, as well he might have.
McConaughey, a son of Uvalde,Texas, clearly has the dirt-road credentials to bring this backwoods fugitive to life -- and well he does. With mud-soaked hair, sunburned skin and one shirt to his name, he charms the boys with tales of snakebites, jailhouse tattoos and misty-eyed memories of his dusty backroad love affair with Juniper. It seems then that they will do anything for him -- and they do -- until true life breaks over them like a river storm.
"Mud" is a good solid movie, not great, not fierce. It moves slowly like the river that runs through it. But like that river, a lot of emotional debris, chunks of soul and pieces of broken hearts pop to the surface.
J.P. Devine is a former stage and screen actor.

Salami, culatello, pancetta, coppa.
Businesses that traffic in Italian cured pork products are excited about the possibility of importing more of these "delizioso" meats from regions of northern Italy that have been off-limits to American palates for decades.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced it would relax a ban on the importation of Italian cold cuts and other pork products beginning May 28, a move that will allow products from four regions and two provinces in northern Italy to be imported to the United States.
"It's almost like it's coming full circle," said Bruce Micucci, president of Micucci Wholesale Foods in Portland, which services more than 200 restaurants in Maine, New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts.
"You know, dry-cured meats -- whether it be capicolas and sopressata salamis, all dry-cured prosciuttos -- were very popular 30 years ago," Micucci said. "It's not so much new meats as accepting the old ways of doing things. ... We've lost so much flavor and taste."
The USDA edict covers the Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont regions, and the provinces of Trento and Bolzano. Meats from these areas had been banned from this country because of the threat of swine vesicular disease, a communicable disease in swine.
Arlin Smith, general manager of Hugo's restaurant and Eventide Oyster Co. in Portland, said once products from these regions of Italy become available, "I guarantee you we would be buying as much of that stuff as possible. It's beautiful stuff. They are the masters. They are the ones who have been doing it for years."
Carrie Davenport, general manager of The Rogers Collection, a Portland-based importer of Mediterranean foods, predicted that a lot more authentic Italian charcuterie will become available in U.S. markets, and that over time, more regions of Italy could be opened as well.
Portland consumers who today buy Italian-style meats at Micucci's, the Italian grocery on India Street, may well be buying products made in Canada. Davenport said Italian producers have set up factories in Canada and export meats from there to the United States, "but it's not the authentic product from Italy."
"It's done with the same recipes," she said, "but it's basically an imitation product, so to speak."
Meat-processing plants in Italy must meet USDA standards, and initially there probably will be only a small number of plants within the regions that will be able to meet those standards, Davenport said. But as time goes on, more plants will be approved, and more products should become available.
Culatello, a refined cut of prosciutto that is cured and soaked in wine, will be one new import that will be coveted by chefs, Davenport said. Lardo, or cured fatback, will be "huge."
"There are lots of salamis and sausages and different cuts that you never see in America," Smith said. "Some of them are (made with) spontaneous fermentation. Basically, the same exact sausage in five different areas of Italy, every single one of them is going to taste different."
Lee Skawinski, chef and owner of Vignola Cinque Terre in Portland, has visited Italy many times to search for new products that he can bring back for his restaurant's menu.
He said both terroir and tradition make Italian salumi so full of flavor and prized by chefs and food lovers. "Terroir" refers to the natural environment in which the product was made. Where was the animal raised, and how? What did it eat?
"There's nothing like boar salumi from Tuscany, you know?" he said. "You just can't replicate that. Those flavors and those aromas just don't happen anyplace else in the world. It's because of the breeds of pigs and what they're eating."
There's so much regional variety in husbandry and production techniques in Italy, Skawinski said, that a Slow Food book that records all the different kinds of salumi is 400 pages long.
"People who are making salumi over there, a lot of them are families that have been doing this for 50, 60, 70, 100 years," he said. "I know that the guys we buy prosciutto from have about a 30 percent turnback rate on the legs of pork that they buy.
"So they accept only seven out of 10, at best. There's a very, very strict quality level with a lot of the good producers that they live or die buy."
The opening of the markets couldn't come at a better time. Americans' tastes are changing, and they are becoming more adventurous eaters willing to try a greater variety of foods.
Micucci notes that eight to 10 years ago, few stores carried -- and few cooks used -- pancetta in Maine. Now it's everywhere.
Micucci's brother Rick, who owns the Micucci grocery, has noticed a preference among his customers for the authentic Italian prosciutto that already is sold there over domestic varieties.
"It's different, and it's just a terrific product," he said. "We sell more of that than the domestic, even though it is about twice the price. We don't even sell the domestic mortadella anymore. We only sell mortadella from Italy because it was that much different.
"We do produce some pretty good salamis in this country," Rick Micucci added, "but I would love to see some from Italy."
Davenport said consumers are demanding better, more authentic products partly because of their exposure to them in their travels, through the media and popular culture.
She points to the huge popularity of Eataly, a bustling collection of Italian markets and restaurants in New York City, with a second U.S. location opening in Chicago this year.
"I feel like the world is becoming a smaller place," Davenport said. "People have traveled or watched cooking channels where people are traveling, and they're more curious and more willing to try products from other cultures."

Staff Writer
BELGRADE -- On Thursday afternoon, a $20,000 buoy was deployed into the waters of Great Pond, a move environmental scientists say will help to answer questions about algal blooms and other looming threats to the lake's ecosystem.
Those who see the bright yellow buoy on the surface of the lake near Hoyt's Island might not realize that it could offer an early warning of blooms in the Belgrade Lakes and other waterways throughout Maine.
"We're seeing that they could be coming here more rapidly," Denise Bruesewitz, professor of environmental studies at Colby College, said of the blooms. "That's part of why Great Pond was chosen. It's in this state where they're not very prevalent, but where that could change."
The high-tech buoy will use a variety of solar-powered sensors to collect a rich data stream and wirelessly transmit it to a global network of scientists who will gain a better understanding of the complex natural processes that occur in the lake.
Among other things, scientists hope that regular readings on temperature, oxygen levels, light levels and phytoplankton activity will help combat the blooms, which have the potential to undermine seriously the region's tourist destination value.
Blooms happen when lake conditions allow for a population explosion of algae, which can clot the surface of the water with slimy green sheets of organic matter.
When the algae die and sink to the bottom of the lake, their decomposition takes so much oxygen out of the water that entire populations of fish can suffocate.
Algal blooms have been documented in the seven bodies of water that make up the Belgrade Lakes system since the 1990s, but so far, they have been relatively mild.
In East Pond, another lake in the system, East Pond Association President Rob Jones said blooms there have been of short duration and not severe enough to kill fish.
Still, he said, they are "at times, aesthetically unpleasant," and they have been a focus of mitigation efforts by the association for years.
Five algal blooms were recorded by the Department of Environmental Protection in Maine in 2012. One was in nearby China Lake, which the department said blooms every year. The other 2012 blooms were found in lakes in Eastbrook, Franklin, Jefferson and Rangeley.
On Great Pond, the mild algal blooms have not risen to the standard.
"Not even close," Whitney King, a Colby chemistry professor who has helped lead the effort said about blooms on Great Pond. "There's been nothing that the DEP would call a bloom."
A total of 54 lakes in Maine "frequently support algal blooms," according to the department.
Changes in climate can increase the occurrence, severity and impact of harmful algal blooms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which in 2004 was officially tasked by the federal government to research the blooms.
As the global climate shifts, blooms appear to be increasing -- not only in Maine, but in surface waters across the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Large blooms also have a large price tag.
In 2005, a form of algal bloom commonly referred to as red tide cost Maine and Massachusetts $23 million in shellfish sales, one of many coastal blooms that cost the United States at least $82 million each year, according to the oceanic administration.
It is hard to predict exactly how much money Maine might lose in the face of recurring algal blooms in lakes. A survey conducted by the World Health Organization found that one-third of tourists to coastal destinations would cancel their plans if they knew of an algal bloom in the area. In Kansas, a rash of severe blooms in 2011 caused a revenue drop of about 50 percent at Cheney State Park and turned some previously popular lakeside communities into ghost towns, according to local news reports.
The value of the Belgrade Lakes watershed is the subject of another ongoing study by Colby College. Once that study is completed, it may be possible to predict the costs of the blooms, which could help to leverage money to help prevent them.
The East Pond Association has been working to convince property owners in the watershed to take measures to prevent phosphorus from leaching into the lakes, because phosphorus can feed and stimulate the growth of algae.
On Great Pond in Belgrade on Thursday, the buoy deployment itself went fairly smoothly -- two boats full of Colby students and project leaders took the bright yellow buoy, affectionately known as "Goldie the Great Pond Sentinel" out to an agreed-upon point and went about arranging it with its anchors.
Fifteen minutes later, the buoy was fully operational. The only casualties were a cut a student suffered on his hand while wrestling the heavy buoy and anchors overboard, and a single screwdriver that inadvertently was dropped into the deepest depths of the pond, estimated at 65 feet.
Even before the sensors were dropped into the water, they were transmitting information back to a computer in the Maine Lakes Resource Center. Every fifteen minutes, a new set of data is transmitted, allowing for a detailed tracking of what is happening beneath the lake's surface.
Great Pond is one of about 50 lakes worldwide with such sensor-laden buoys on them. The lakes collectively give scientists in the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network information that can help to answer questions about global and regional trends.
On the local level, Bruesewitz, King and their colleagues can compare data to any observed algal blooms, which will allow for a better prediction and, ultimately, prevention.
If scientists understood exactly what conditions created the threshold for a harmful bloom, they could direct resources more effectively to prevent those conditions from happening.

NUGGET:
Great Pond and the other six water bodies in the Belgrade Lakes will benefit from a $150,000 matching gift from an anonymous donation that will be used to battle invasive milfoil, the Belgrade Lakes Association announced Thursday.
The grant's matching funds have been applied to a $20,000 allocation from the town of Belgrade and $10,000 from the town of Rome.
The grant will double those allocations and those of other past donors, and will triple donations from new donors.
In 2012, the Stop Milfoil campaign was launched in partnership with the Belgrade Lakes Regional Conservation Alliance, with a stated three-year goal of raising $500,000. Last year, $285,000 was raised toward that goal.
The money is being used to bolster an aggressive campaign against milfoil in North Bay of Great Pond and Great Meadow Stream, which is a tributary that flows from North Pond into North Bay.
Milfoil was first discovered in Great Meadow Stream in 2010 and had spread downstream into North Bay by 2011.
Last year, 50,000 gallons of the invasive plant were removed from those two areas.
Milfoil is present in 27 of Maine's estimated 6,000 lakes and ponds, according to the association.

Full text:   The debate about the tar sands pipelines in Maine and the Midwest has centered on the potential for oil spills.
While spills are a significant risk, the impact on the climate is the overriding concern.
The change in the climate that already has occurred is obvious to anyone who spends time outdoors. Frost comes in mid-October instead of mid-September. Apple trees blossom in April. Lake ice is unsafe well into January. Insects such as ticks that were once frozen out of Maine are migrating north with the diseases they carry.
The United States and Canada are among the top per capita energy consumers in the developed world. In the United States, it is commonly accepted that cheap energy is a pre-requisite for a healthy economy. If so, why is Germany, where gas sells at $8.56 per gallon, the economic juggernaut of Europe?
In Maine, the long-term economic risks from a warming climate are lost in our focus on the short-term economy. Consider these risks:
* The ski and snowmobiling industries will suffer from less snow and shorter winters.
* The maple sugar industry will decline as maple trees die off.
* The shellfish industry will decline with warmer ocean water and carbon induced acidification.
* Coastal communities will experience more frequent and severe flooding.
We need to wean ourselves from fossil fuels, not add new sources with energy intensive extraction requirements. Climate scientists overwhelmingly recognize that the planet is warming dramatically and that the risks are daunting. A handful of bogus studies funded by ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel interests have perpetuated uncertainty.
We need President Barack Obama to require environmental impact assessments for pipelines carrying tar sands in Maine and elsewhere, and for Maine's congressional delegation to lead on federal climate policy.

Full text:   State House Bureau
AUGUSTA -- Fearing back-to-back seasons of record landings but diminished prices, a majority of lobstermen, processors and dealers told lawmakers Wednesday that they're willing to pay more to do their jobs if the state will spend more marketing its trademark product.
Their message was aimed at the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee, which is considering a bill to expand marketing of Maine lobsters by increasing surcharges on the licenses of lobstermen and dealers.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Chuck Kruger, D-Thomaston, is the result of numerous meetings of industry representatives during a difficult 2012 season, in which lobstermen hauled more crustaceans than the year before but saw demand and prices fall.
The proposal, designed to expand the market for Maine lobster, is supported by the Department of Marine Resources. It restructures the duties and composition of the Legislature-created Lobster Promotion Council to improve the focus of the agency's marketing mission.
The council already collects surcharges from lobster license holders, crab fishermen, dealers and industry related services. But supporters of Kruger's bill argue that the council's current budget isn't sufficient to expand into other markets.
This year's marketing budget is about $380,000. Kruger's bill would increase the budget to $1 million in 2014, $2 million in 2015 and $3 million in 2016 through step increases in license surcharges.
Dealers and lobstermen testified in favor of the bill on Wednesday. While some lamented the steep increases in surcharges, others said it was necessary.
Robert Baines, a lobsterman from South Thomaston and chairman of the Lobster Advisory Council, said it is usually difficult to unite lobstermen on a single issue, but they see no other way forward.
"Our industry certainly needs some help and this is the only way we think we can do it," Baines said.
The Maine Lobstermen's Association, the Downeast Lobstermen's Association and other stakeholder groups agreed.
Patrice McCarron, director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, said the bill was imperative so that the marketing council has a "predictable and stable long-term funding source."
According to the Department of Marine Resources, lobstermen landed 123 million pounds of lobsters in 2012, an increase of approximately 18 million pounds over 2011.
However, the total value for landings was $331 million, down $3.7 million from 2011. The average price of $2.69 per pound for 2012 was Maine's lowest on record since 1994 and well below the $3.19 a pound average in 2011, according to Department of Marine Resources reports.
The industry fears conditions are lining up to create a repeat of 2012, including an abbreviated hard shell season due to warm water and the spread of shell disease northward from southern New England. That bacterial infection has decimated lobster populations, particularly in Rhode Island.
Some lobstermen are already reporting sightings of soft-shell, or shedder, lobsters. Shedders fetch a much lower market price than hard-shell lobsters.
It's too early to know for sure whether the soft-shell lobsters that have been sighted in the Gulf of Maine are part of a normal cycle in which a small percentage of the population molts early, according to marine scientists and shellfish monitors.

Full text:   Portland Press Herald
With the 2012 glut of lobsters and plummeting prices still vivid memories, Maine lobstermen are hatching strategies to cultivate new markets and more customers for the state's leading fishery.
Lobstermen are expecting another big harvest, but it's unclear whether that will begin early again, said Marianne LaCroix, acting director of the Maine Lobster Promotion Council, an industry-funded organization in Portland devoted to advancing the livelihoods associated with the fishery.
"Obviously," she said, "we don't want to be in the same situation" as last year, when the lobster harvest soared but prices for fishermen took a dive to their lowest point since the mid-1990s.
In 2012, the season for shedders, or molting lobsters, was four to five weeks early and brought the Maine and U.S. fisheries into competition with Canada in late May and June, said Rick Wahle, research associate professor in the School of Marine Sciences at the University of Maine.
Processors customarily are still handling the lobster harvest from Canadian waters, which occurs in the winter months, well into May, Wahle said. When the lobster season started more than a month early in Maine, there weren't enough buyers on hand.
"The so-called glut brought the price down," Wahle said.
But, LaCroix said, even though the timing of the harvest didn't jibe completely with the processing demand, all the Maine lobster was marketed. "Not at the price everyone's happy with," she acknowledged, but it still was sold.
Within the next month, the council and other lobstermen's organizations will begin mapping out specific plans to expand markets and broaden the customer base for the fishery.
"With a little more preparation ... building a little bit of demand ... more processors will be on line earlier this year," LaCroix said.
The organization hopes to generate media attention to help consumers better understand pricing and accentuate the long history of the fishery, and the partnership between lobstermen and government.
One plan, initiated by a lobsterman, is a charity event in the New York-New Jersey area, for which Maine fishermen will donate lobsters for the survivors of Superstorm Sandy. The event will not only be a much-needed boost to that region, but it will also potentially open a new market, LaCroix said.
One Portland company, Calendar Islands Maine Lobster, is working to move beyond the wholesale market by introducing new retail products. A fishermen's cooperative that started as a wholesale operation and now mostly sells into retail channels, Calendar Islands Maine Lobster handles everything "from boat to end sale," said its president, John Jordan.
He said the only realistic solution is to create demand for Maine lobsters in a different form. His company, for example, is introducing new lobster products, including shelled lobster tails on cedar planks, which would be grilled. These join a line of prepared lobster foods, including quiches, rangoons, split tails and "naked lobster" -- all the meat but no shell.
"We've got to take Maine on the road," Jordan said. "Maine has a fantastic identity in the food world." He said the high volume of lobster dictates a transition to a global market.
If prices stay in decline, lobstermen really only have two choices, said Wahle, the UMaine researcher: They can stop fishing or fish harder. Some lobstermen already are reporting making as many as three hauls a day -- early morning, midday and evening -- to make up for lower prices.
Concern over the potential of a repeat high-volume early season has arisen in part because 2012 -- with a record harvest -- turned traumatic for fishermen. Additionally, there have been signs that the same set of conditions seems to be lining up already for 2013: early shedders, warmer water temperatures, the spread northward from southern New England of shell disease, and a bacterial infection that has decimated lobster populations, particularly in Rhode Island.
But it's too early to know for sure whether the soft-shelled shedders that have been sighted in the Gulf of Maine are part of a normal cycle in which a small percentage of the population molt early, according to marine scientists and shellfish monitors.
"We did get some shedders, just a few," said Alex Todd, a fisherman from Chebeague Island, about recent trips. "That's not that uncommon in the last three or four years," he added, indicating he does take it as a sign that lobsters will be somewhat early again this year.
Ordinarily, the phenomenon occurs in its greatest numbers in early summer, with the big take in July, said Wahle.
Soft-shells in winter and an early start of the lobstering season, then, don't necessarily mean rough waters ahead. Instead, it's the combination of factors -- more lobsters, fewer predators such as cod and flounder, warming waters due to climate change -- that stir up the bottom-line worries about money and secure livelihoods.
The average price per pound of $2.69 for 2012 was the lowest on record since 1994, according to Depatment of Marine Resources reports. In comparison, 2011 landings were 20 million pounds lighter at nearly 105 million pounds. The value of that smaller catch was $3.19 a pound and close to $335 million -- shy of the 2012 value, but not by much.
"The tale will really be told in April and May" when temperature increases or fluctuations might be more evident, Jordan said. Right now, although there is clear evidence of warmer water temperatures and accompanying early moltings, the full picture won't be clear for a couple of months.
But signs of a repeat of 2012 conditions in the Gulf of Maine, Todd said, raise anxiety about whether things are shaping up for a "perfect storm for a big lobster volume."

It wasn't unusual for the Colby men's track team to have the winner in the 55-meter dash at Saturday's Maine state meet. After all, Dom Kone has won a couple national championships.
But while Kone raced in the preliminaries Saturday, he skipped the finals. Colby freshman Ethan Druskat won with a time of 6.57 seconds.
"His high school PR in the 55 was 6.49, I think," Colby coach Jared Beers said. "What he ran on Saturday was his third best time ever."
Druskat went to Oyster River High School in Durham, N.H. A week before winning the 55 at the state meet, he was part of Colby's winning 4x400 relay team at the University of Southern Maine Invitational.
"He was our top recruit last year, and it shows," Beers said.
At the state meet, Colby finished fourth overall out of five schools.
"It was a good meet," Beers said. "We were pretty dominated by the flu, unfortunately, so the meat of our middle distance squad didn't run. We had a lot of season's best, a few more New England qualifiers. In that regard, it was an outstanding meet."
Colby has two meets scheduled this weekend before the New England Division III championships Feb. 15-16 at Bates. On Saturday, Colby is competing in the Valentine Classic at Boston University and the Tufts Invitational at Medford, Mass.
Beers said he will send anyone who is running around an oval to BU and the athletes competing in field events to Tufts.
"BU has arguably the fastest track in New England, maybe in the country," Beers said.
* * *
Belgrade native Ben Roy is having a fine season for the St. Anselm College men's ski team. Roy, a junior and Messalonskee High School graduate, has been the top skier for the Hawks this year.
On Jan. 18, Roy placed first overall at Gunstock in Gilford, N.H., as part of the Brown University Carnival. A day later, he was fourth at Blackwater in Andover, N.H.
This past weekend, Roy competed in the St. Anselm College Carnival and was seventh overall on the first day and 11th on Day 2.
* * *
Another Belgrade native, Teraysa White of the College of St. Scholastica, is among the top Division III goalies in the country for the women's ice hockey team.
The NCAA has not provided any statistical reports for Division III women's hockey this season. But if you go by last year's final numbers, White's current save percentage of .917 would rank her in the top 35. She has given up 45 goals this season while making 496 saves -- nearly 25 per game. This weekend against the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, White made 27 saves in a 0-0 overtime tie for her third shutout of the season.

FEDERAL AID Struggling fishermen face weeks-long wait

Full text:   Washington Bureau Chief
WASHINGTON -- New England fishermen will have to wait at least several more weeks to find out whether Congress will provide federal aid to the region's struggling groundfishing industry.
On Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved an additional $9.7 billion for flood insurance claims for homeowners and business owners devastated by the storm Sandy in late October. The Senate, by comparison, had passed $60.4 billion in Sandy relief last month, including $150 million for federally designated fisheries disasters in the Northeast and elsewhere.
Now, fishermen and members of Congress from northeastern states may have to fight to include the fisheries assistance in a second, larger Sandy relief bill slated for consideration in the House during the week of Jan. 14.
The situation in Congress is adding to uncertainty as Maine's groundfishing fleet braces for additional catch reductions from federal regulators.
"We are really disappointed that it was taken out," said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association, who is also sector manager for the Port Clyde Community Groundfish Sector.
Martens said fishermen are facing potentially disastrous cuts in their fishing allowances. The federal disaster aid could provide a level of financial assurance to the fleet -- already down to fewer than 50 boats in Maine -- by helping offset the costs of additional at-sea monitoring or sector management, Martens said.
"There is definitely a lot of concern in Maine and throughout New England," he said.
In September, the U.S. Department of Commerce declared that New England and several other northeastern states were facing a commercial fishing failure because stocks of cod and other groundfish were not recovering, despite fishermen's compliance with strict catch limits.
The federal disaster declaration opens the door to additional federal assistance to the states, which typically have broad discretion for using that money. Potential applications include funding research, defraying management costs or direct assistance to fishermen.
This is the fourth time since 2005 that a fishery in Maine was declared a commercial disaster. The three previous declarations applied to shellfish, which were devastated by red tide outbreaks.
The Senate's Sandy-relief bill -- which died Thursday with the closing of the 112th Congress -- included $150 million for the northeastern groundfishery as well as for fishery disasters in Alaska, Mississippi, New York and New Jersey.
Fresh off a fight with his members over the fiscal cliff compromise, Republican House Speaker John Boehner opted to delay a vote on the Senate's $60.4 billion Sandy relief bill because of concern about the size and scope of the package. Boehner's decision outraged New York and New Jersey Republicans, however, and led to Friday's $9.7 billion bill followed by a larger aid package in two weeks.
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., defended the inclusion of non-Sandy related disasters in the bill, saying Congress has a long tradition of providing assistance to multiple events in a single bill. The Senate had also proposed funding for wildfires, drought and other disasters in recent years.
Republican representatives from states covered by the fisheries disaster declarations have also spoken in support of including funding in the Sandy relief bill, as have all four members of Maine's delegation.
"We are very disappointed the money hasn't been included," said Willy Ritch, spokesman for Maine U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District. "Chellie has been arguing that the money for New England fisheries should be included as part of the package and will continue to do that."

Full text:   How can Maine top a year like 2012? Coming soon to a front page near you:
Gov. Paul LePage finally accepts Maine Senate President Justin Alfond's invitation to dinner at an eatery of LePage's choosing. Alfond tactfully orders a salad, while LePage opts for the Happy Meal.
Bruce Poliquin defies a court order that he vacate the state treasurer's office after Neria Douglass, his replacement, arrives to find the door locked and deadbolted. The standoff ends when Douglass agrees to allow Poliquin to issue one press release per week from "The Office of Former State Treasurer Bruce Poliquin," doing business as the Popham Beach Club.
Former state Republican Chairman Charlie Webster gives up his plumbing-and-heating business to become a private investigator. His specialty: tracking down and exposing people who didn't exist in the first place.
Retired U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe and former Secretary of State Charlie Summers simultaneously visit the same Portland area supermarket. Neither Snowe nor her onetime protege speak as they pass each other in the frozen food aisle.
Portland's City Council, in an attempt to "get out in front of rising sea levels caused by global warming," orders the permanent evacuation of Commercial Street. Waterfront attorney Dan Lilley, representing J's Oyster bar, promises to "fight this outrage until hell freezes over."
Hell freezes over.
In a final, desperate attempt to keep his name in the news, opponent of all things homosexual Michael Heath officiates at the wedding of two gay men. Following the painfully awkward ceremony, Heath tells the media, "The devil made me do it."
The devil demands an apology.
Zumba instructor Alexis Wright's prostitution case ends in a mistrial after the judge receives a handwritten note from the jury foreman. Wright, the foreman complains, "won't stop undressing me with her eyes."
U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, miffed at how much time her new Maine counterpart, Sen. Angus King, is getting on national television, announces she will no longer appear on the Sunday morning talk shows. "Meet the Press," "Face the Nation" and "This Week" all scramble to book King for his reaction.
State Rep. Diane Russell, D-Portland, testifying in favor of her bill to fully legalize marijuana in Maine, shocks the Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee by lighting up a joint halfway through her prepared remarks. Losing her place, Russell cheerfully offers to withdraw her bill in exchange for "something munchy."
Maine's tea party movement boils away. Supporters of Ron Paul get the vapors.
Eliot Cutler stuns the entire state by announcing that he will not run again for governor. Longtime political operative Dennis Bailey is treated at Maine Medical Center for two broken hands after giving himself repeated high fives.
Due to persistent glitches in its computer software, the Department of Health and Human Services reveals that it cannot account for one of the H's in "DHHS." A frustrated Commissioner Mary Mayhew announces that until further notice, "we can deal with health or humans, but not both."
A group calling itself "Concealed Weapon Carriers of Maine" holds a "concealed carry walk" around Portland's Back Cove on a busy Sunday afternoon. Nobody notices.
Maine's Democratic Party announces that in lieu of a statewide primary, it will henceforth advertise for gubernatorial candidates on Craigslist.
The Maine Heritage Policy Center releases an in-depth report calling for the repeal of Maine's income tax, local property tax, inheritance tax and severe curtailments of the sales, gasoline and excise taxes. The report's title: "Revenues -- Who Needs 'Em?"
The Maine People's Alliance responds with an even heftier report titled, "Ummm ... We Do."
Seething from the Democratically controlled Legislature's 50th consecutive override of his veto, Gov. LePage abruptly announces, "I quit!" Within seconds, Maine Chief Justice Leigh Saufley administers the oath of office to Gov.-designate Justin Alfond.
To which LePage responds, "Wait. What?"
And so it begins.

Full text:   Washington Bureau Chief
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Senate passed a $60 billion disaster relief bill Friday that includes funding to support struggling groundfishing fleets in Maine and other northeastern states.
On a 60-35 vote, senators defeated an attempt to strip $150 million in funding for four federally designated fisheries disasters -- including the Northeast groundfishery -- from the larger relief bill for mid-Atlantic states that were hit by Hurricane Sandy in October.
Maine's Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe voted to maintain the fisheries funding.
The bill now goes to the Republican-controlled House, where it could face stronger opposition because of its size and scope.
If approved by the House as written, the relief bill will likely provide millions of dollars to support Maine's groundfishing fleet, which has shrunk to just a few dozen boats and faces additional austere catch limits on cod and other species.
Maine, like other states, would likely have broad flexibility in its use of the money.
Meredith Mendelson, deputy commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, said the highest-priority uses for the funding would be to help fishermen cover the cost of at-sea monitoring and other fishing-sector management costs.
"Those costs are typically paid for now by individual members of groundfishing sectors," said Mendelson.
The priorities were identified by state officials and fishermen, who typically have opposed direct payments to fishermen, Mendelson said. But even if the line item survives a House vote, Maine won't expect large sums.
"We would want to be very targeted in how any resources are appropriated, should that happen," she said.
Cod fishing is often credited with helping to build New England in Colonial America. But overfishing and other factors have depleted cod stocks, prompting austere catch limits on the relatively few groundfish boats that still operate.
Most Maine fishermen have switched to lobster or other species, leaving less than 50 boats in the state with federal permits. And the region's fishermen are bracing for catch limits on some species that are 70 to 80 percent less next year than in 2011.
The northeastern groundfishery became eligible for additional federal support in September when the U.S. Department of Commerce declared it an economic disaster. It was the fourth time since 2005 that a fishery in Maine had been declared a commercial disaster, with the other three covering shellfish because of red tide.
It is up to Congress to appropriate money, so lawmakers from the region inserted a budget item into the superstorm Sandy disaster relief bill.
The bill contains disaster assistance for three other fisheries: Chinook salmon in Alaska, blue crabs in Mississippi, and fleets in New York and New Jersey that were affected by Hurricane Sandy.
Some senators objected to the inclusion, arguing that the $60 billion relief bill was laden with issues unrelated to Hurricane Sandy that could be handled separately next year.
They also argued that any funding for the fisheries disaster should be offset by spending cuts elsewhere.
"All we are doing is stealing from our kids," said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a vocal critic of government borrowing and the author of the amendment to strip the fisheries funding from the bill. "If we're going to do $150 million for fisheries, ought we not cut spending somewhere else to pay for it?"
Senators from the affected states cautioned their colleagues against setting a precedent that would require offsets that could delay funding for future natural or economic disasters.
Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., pointed out that Congress approved disaster relief within two weeks of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, while two months have passed without a disaster bill for Sandy's victims.
Menendez said he welcomed the inclusion of funding for other disasters.

Full text:   Portland Press Herald
The chambered nautilus, a prehistoric mollusk whose shell is a nearly perfect spiral, is being hunted to extinction because of its beauty.
While the world has yet to pay much attention to the issue, two boys in Maine have emerged among the loudest voices urging protection for the species.
Josiah Utsch, 12, of Cape Elizabeth, and Ridgely Kelly, 11, of Bremen, have raised nearly $10,000 to buy underwater equipment for scientists studying the creatures. Most of the money has come from other children.
"It's been a kid-driven thing so far," said Elise Strong, Josiah's mother. "We hope to get the adults involved."
Publicity generated by the boys has raised awareness about the issue, said Peter Ward, a biologist at the University of Washington. "They have very much played a huge part in saving the nautilus."
The chambered nautilus, which lives in the Pacific Ocean near Asia, is considered a living fossil. Modern nautiluses are nearly identical to fossilized nautiluses that are nearly 200 million years old, Ward said.
The nautilus has experienced little evolutionary change because of its stable habitat -- deep-water slopes adjacent to coral reefs, Ward said.
The nautilus uses tentacles to catch small prey, like shrimp. It also scavenges dead creatures that tumble down from coral reefs.
The spiraled shell of the nautilus is divided into chambers, with the animal occupying the outermost chamber. The inner chambers, filled with gas, help the nautilus maintain neutral buoyancy.
Fishermen catch the softball-size creatures with traps that operate like lobster traps. It takes a nautilus 15 years to reach sexual maturity, so it is vulnerable to overfishing, Ward said.
Josiah said it's hard to imagine that an animal that has survived for 200 million years could become extinct in his lifetime.
"It would be a tragedy to survive a ton of mass extinctions and have them wiped out by a human mass extinction," he said.
A year ago, Josiah's grandmother sent him a New York Times article reporting that fishermen have been killing nautiluses by the millions to meet the growing worldwide demand for their lustrous shells.
The opalescent material from the shells' inner surface is ground into pearl shapes and sold as a cheaper alternative to pearls, usually marketed as Osmeña pearl.
Unlike rhinoceros horns or elephant tusks, which are considered contraband, nautilus shells have no protection, and the threat to the species has gone largely unnoticed by the public, the article noted.
Internet search results for the phrase "save the nautilus" are dominated by www.savethenautilus.com, the website the Maine boys created a year ago, and links to news articles about their efforts.
Eager to donate money to help one of his favorite animals, Josiah contacted Ward, who was quoted in the New York Times article, and asked if there was an organization devoted to helping the nautilus. Ward said there was no such group.
So Josiah, with help from his friend Ridgely, created the website and started accepting donations, using the nonprofit status of the University of Washington.
The boys also started selling Save the Nautilus T-shirts, designed by Ridgely.
Time for Kids magazine published a story about their campaign earlier this year, and soon the boys began getting emails and handwritten letters from teachers and children from around the nation. They also began receiving checks.
Children raised money walking dogs, donating their allowances and asking friends to donate in lieu of birthday presents.
A 9-year-old boy from Bloomfield, N.J., sent a check for $12, saying he had raised the money by selling pencils.
One girl, Victoria, 11, from Uniondale, N.Y., wrote to the boys that she had read about their campaign at school.
"I want to help save the nautilus," she wrote. "Here is $20 doolers."
A 12-year-old girl named Sadie from Palm Beach County, Fla., created a list of websites of companies that sell nautilus shells. She sent the list to the boys, who put the information on their website.
Ward said more data is needed about the range and abundance of the nautilus to enable scientists to estimate its population and determine a sustainable catch.
Ward and other marine biologists are lobbying for protection of the nautilus under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, the United Nations rules that combat illegal trade in species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants.
The boys, who went to Washington state recently to meet with Ward, will go to American Samoa in February to help with his study. Their parents will pay for the trip, and Ward will provide housing.
Ward said the boys will go scuba diving and help him determine how fast the nautilus can swim, and how long it takes it to reach its natural habitat, as much as 2,000 feet below the surface, after it is dropped at the surface.
He said the boys will monitor the creatures with radio transmitters attached to their shells.
Ward, 63, said he's impressed by the boys' passion for science, and their persistence and ability to work hard.
"They remind me of myself when I was young," he said.

Full text:   Maine Sunday Telegram
Last April, Maine lawmakers passed a wild mushroom foraging law in an effort to rein in the unregulated practice and keep poisonous mushrooms off the market. It was the most extensive law of its kind in the nation, and required foragers to complete a training course before being allowed to sell their products to restaurants and retailers.
But eight months later, the law still has not been implemented. The program to certify wild mushroom foragers and brokers has not been put in place. An advisory board established by the law has yet to be formed.
Meanwhile, wild mushrooms are still being peddled to restaurants and retailers -- unchecked and unsupervised.
"I've had guys come in at 10 in the morning with beer on their breath (trying to sell wild mushrooms)," said Rob Evans, the James Beard award-winning chef who owns Duckfat in Portland. "I think that's the scary side that the state's trying to deal with."
But the problem, some say, is that the state isn't dealing with it.
The law charges the Department of Health and Human Services with setting up a training and exam program to certify wild mushroom foragers and brokers who sell to restaurants and retailers.
But Gov. Paul LePage hasn't appointed the advisory committee required to create the certification program. And those familiar with the law question whether it's possible to operate a certification program at all after LePage threatened to veto the law unless the certification fee was lowered from $200 to $20, which it eventually was.
"We can't put the course on," said Richard Grotton, president and CEO of the Maine Restaurant Association, who served on the task force that drafted the original bill. "We have a program in search of funding."
As the months tick by since the legislation was passed, suspect mushrooms continue to be shopped around to restaurants and retailers, and the burden remains on chefs and buyers to weed out any misidentified and poisonous varieties.
'Wild, wild west' situation
Estimates presented to lawmakers during the debate over the bill put the number of commercial foragers at 200. However, because of the unregulated nature of the industry and the "here today, gone tomorrow" ways of many amateur foragers, no one can say with certainty how many operate in Maine.
Chefs including Andrew Taylor, who co-owns Hugo's and Eventide Oyster Co. in Portland, describe the situation with mushroom foragers as the "wild, wild west."
Taylor said he's had foragers try to sell him misidentified mushrooms, but he never buys them because he has a working knowledge of wild mushrooms and only buys from two reliable sources.
He recalls a batch of misidentified mushrooms that a forager tried to sell to him as porcinis. He later learned that they were sold to another restaurant.
"They weren't poisonous," Taylor said. "Just inedible."
But some chefs aren't as knowledgeable as Taylor.
In 2008, two Portland chefs bought what they thought were porcinis, an edible mushroom, from a forager. They were actually poisonous lilac brown boletes.
The boletes were never served to the public, but the chefs consumed them and were hospitalized. The incident led to the creation of the law.
Adding to the law's troubles, one prominent forager said it doesn't do enough to protect public health and is circulating a petition seeking support to strengthen it.
So far, forager Rick Tibbetts, who owns the Scarborough-based Tibbetts Mushroom Co. and sells to many of the best-known restaurants in greater Portland, has gathered more than 100 signatures from chefs and food buyers.
He wants the law amended to promote accountable foraging by requiring foragers to carry liability insurance and encouraging sustainable practices to prevent over-harvesting.
Evans, Taylor and other chefs support Tibbetts' proposal to amend the law.
"If someone went through the process of getting insurance, they're serious about what they're doing, so that would make me feel better," Evans said.
However, the more immediate hurdle for the law is the certification fee that the governor insisted be capped at $20.
It has become standard procedure for LePage to demand lower fees in all bills that reach his desk.
"From the governor's perspective, putting fees on small business and putting the burden on their backs is not the solution," said Adrienne Bennett, LePage's spokeswoman. "The governor has been very clear that we can't raise taxes and we can't raise fees."
Rep. Heather Sirocki, R-Scarborough, who worked to amend the bill after the governor threatened to veto it, advocated for a compromise fee of $75. But LePage was adamant that it be $20.
"I just don't see that the governor is going to budge on that," Sirocki said. "I tried. He's very firm."
The low fee means the advisory committee -- should it ever be seated -- will face a difficult task. The 12-member committee is charged with determining the parameters for the training program, including the curriculum, the qualifications for trainers and the exam.
The shape and substance of the training won't be known until the committee is seated. But those experienced in running training programs say it's impossible to implement a program with such limited funding.
Grotton said the task force felt it could create a curriculum and hire trainers for $75, but $20 wouldn't work.
"We're willing to move forward, but it has to be funded, and we don't have the funding," said Grotton, who put forth his name to fill the advisory committee seat designated for the Maine Restaurant Association.
The association regularly hosts the two-day ServSafe Food Handler training, and charges $129 for members and $170 for nonmembers. The fee includes a textbook.
Mushroom educator Greg Marley, author of "Mushrooms for Health" and "Chanterelle Dreams, Amanita Nightmares," and a board member of the Maine Mycological Association, agreed that the $20 fee is too low.
"It simply will not function at $20," said Marley, who sat on the task force that helped draft the law.
Marley said that after the fee was lowered, the task force met one final time. During that meeting, he said, members of the group felt the only way the certification program could move forward would be by requiring those seeking certification to pay the $20 fee to the Department of Health and Human Services, which would then direct applicants to private trainers who would deliver the training for a fee set by each instructor.
Under such a system, those seeking certification could end up paying more than the $200 fee included in the original version of the legislation.
Among the 12 members required to form the committee, eight need to be appointed by the governor and four are state employees, including representatives from DHHS, the Department of Agriculture and the University of Maine. Those who must be appointed include two representatives from the Maine Mycological Association plus a chef, a forager, a wild mushroom broker, a wholesale food distributor, a poison control center representative and a member of the Maine Restaurant Association.
The Maine Mycological Association is still debating whether its members will agree to be part of the committee because of concern over the reduced fee, according to Marley. The person charged with overseeing the certification program had not heard there was potential reluctance among needed committee members until contacted by a reporter.
"We're not going to have a committee, if that's the case," said Lisa Roy, program manager for the Health Inspection Program at DHHS. "It is too bad, because we've put a lot of hard work into it."
The task force met for three years before submitting draft legislation.
High price, high risk
In addition to problems caused by the reduced fee, some chefs feel the law doesn't have enough teeth to protect public health.
"I don't buy (mushrooms) from anyone who doesn't have a substantial insurance policy," said Joe Fournier, agricultural coordinator for Rosemont Market, who buys wild mushrooms for the company's four stores. "I'm not going to buy from anyone off the street."
That doesn't stop people from trying. Fournier said that "in the spring and fall, there's anywhere from six to 12 people coming in our back door" trying to sell wild mushrooms.
He supports Tibbetts' accountable-foraging proposal.
The increasing number of amateur mushroom foragers approaching restaurants and retailers reflects the wholesale price of wild mushrooms and the dining public's desire for more diverse foods.
Tibbetts, who carries liability insurance, said chicken of the woods mushrooms can sell for up to $12.50 a pound wholesale, while matsutakes can sell for as high as $20 a pound.
"You can make $1,000 a day mushrooming if you're good at it," Tibbetts said. "But (amateur foragers) won't bother to spend $700 to get insurance to protect people."
Evans, of Duckfat, said the amateur foragers often try to underprice their mushrooms in order to sell them to unsuspecting chefs.
"Ten years ago, Sam Hayward (chef/owner of Fore Street) and myself and a couple other restaurants were the only ones using (wild mushrooms)," Evans said. "Now any restaurant seems to be able to afford them and buy them."
Tibbetts said if certified foragers aren't required to carry liability insurance, "the restaurant will take the hit" should someone get poisoned.
But not all chefs are worried about potential liability. Chef David Ross, who owns 50 Local in Kennebunk and often forages for mushrooms himself, doesn't agree that foragers should be required to carry liability insurance.
"If the insurance becomes too expensive and they can't service us or sell us mushrooms, that would be unfortunate," Ross said.
He expressed a similar concern about the cost of the certification fee, but said $75 is reasonable.
Roy, with DHHS, said state law prohibits lawmakers from requiring businesses to carry liability insurance. However, Doug Dunbar, spokesperson for the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, said there is no law prohibiting a requirement for liability insurance, "although occupations generally do not require liability insurance."
Still, other chefs want to see foragers held accountable for what they sell.
"If you're going to make a living off foraging mushrooms, you should carry liability insurance just like restaurants have to if they serve liquor," said chef Jeff Landry, who owns The Farmer's Table in Portland.
and serves on the board of the Maine Restaurant Association.
At the same time, Landrysaid the $20 fee is too low and "gives everybody license to head out to the woods and grab whatever they want."

Portland Press Herald
PORTLAND -- After dealing with a lobster glut and low prices this summer, Peter McAleney felt the seafood industry was finally starting to stabilize this fall.
That is, until superstorm Sandy rolled up the coast and spread not only physical devastation, but also triggered more upheaval in seafood markets.
"There's been nothing going on -- no trucks, planes or anything going down through Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania," said McAleney, who owns New Meadows Lobster Co. "People aren't interested in seafood right now. They're interested in getting their lives back in order."
The result is likely to be a repeat of this summer's lobster glut, but spread throughout the entire industry this time, with plenty of both fish and shellfish in Maine markets because the demand has dropped out of sight in the major markets of the Northeast.
McAleney said he lost a big order from Pennsylvania on Thursday morning because his customer decided he wouldn't sell much lobster to thousands of people still without electricity.
"Seafood is the last thing you're going to bring home to a house without power," said Chris Fream, senior sales executive with North Atlantic Seafood in Portland.
The industry's "wheels are falling off," said Fream. "New York is not taking fish and all the seaside restaurants up and down the East Coast are not open or not having any demand."
Fream said the major fish markets in and around New York aren't selling much fish and, consequently, aren't buying any. The restaurants that still have power also aren't buying seafood because families who have no electricity and have to eat out are still more likely to opt for a quick, cheap fast-food meal than a leisurely seafood dinner.
Fream said he's even gotten calls from fishing boat captains down in Massachusetts looking for a buyer for their catch. Those boats generally sell to markets in Massachusetts, he said.
Fream and others in the industry noted that there was also a jump in landings last weekend as fishing fleets headed into port to avoid the storm barreling up the coast.
The Portland Fish Exchange auction handled 65,643 pounds of fish on Saturday, selling all but 500 pounds of what was offered. Prices were holding up, with large cod going for an average of $4.53 a pound and large dab getting $2.05 a pound.
After being closed for two days, fishermen took just 9,502 pounds to the auction Thursday, and sold only 7,519 pounds. Large cod brought an average of just $3.43 a pound and large dab sold for 60 cents a pound, even though only miniscule amounts of both species were offered for sale.
"It sucks," said Jared Auerbach, owner of Red's Best seafood in Boston, which handles a fair amount of fish caught by Maine fishermen. "There's just no demand and it's killing people right now."
Auerbach said he's facing a potentially significant loss because he didn't think Sandy would be as bad as it was. The markets, he thought, might be disrupted for a day or two, but then would return to normal.
"The fish we bought (last weekend), we ended up overpaying for because I didn't anticipate the storm would be as bad as it was," he said.. "Now our customers don't have power and some don't even have phone lines."
But, as with the lobster glut this fall, the current situation offers a bright side for local seafood lovers.
"All the boats came in at once and there's been a glut of seafood for the last few days," said Nick Alfiero, whose family runs Harbor Fish Market on the Portland waterfront.
"People are begging me to take product and we just can't do it," he said. "Every dealer in Boston has fish in the coolers they're trying to sell."
But that means prices will fall for consumers, particularly this weekend, Alfiero said.
"I think people will get sick and tired of sitting around the house" and head out, either to eat in a restaurant or to buy something to cook at home -- and Alfiero thinks the low prices will mean they will go for fish, which would help ease some of the glut the market is experiencing.

Full text:   Washington Bureau Chief
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of Commerce declared a disaster for New England's struggling groundfishing fleet for the 2013 season, opening the door for Congress to appropriate up to $100 million to help fishermen.
The declaration follows recent studies that found stocks of cod and other species are not recovering as quickly as expected despite the industry's compliance with strict catch limitations. Gov. Paul LePage requested the disaster declaration last November.
"I've been in the business over 30 years, and this is the worst I have ever seen it," said fisherman Tom Casamassa of Saco, one of the few Mainers still fishing for cod, haddock, flounder and other groundfish. Maine is home to just 45 boats in the groundfish fleet, as others have switched to lobster and other species.
"Talking to other fishermen, they are shaking their heads and don't know what to do. ... We're really glad they moved ahead with the disaster declaration. From the sound of it, New England is really going to need it," Casamassa said Thursday.
Cod fishing was once the economic backbone of much of New England, including Maine; but overfishing and other factors have depleted cod stocks, resulting in austere catch limits on the relatively few groundfish boats still operating. Now the fleet faces additional reductions of up to 70 percent in the amount of cod and other species they can land.
Many now fear that this once-robust fishery -- often credited with helping build New England and Colonial America -- is in jeopardy of disappearing.
Like many of his colleagues, Casamassa has been forced to branch out into other fisheries such as shrimp, lobster and even dogfish -- a kind of "trash fish," to some -- in order to survive. While he used to catch groundfish relatively close to shore, Casamassa now describes water down to 50 fathoms -- or 300 feet deep -- as "a desert."
"The future challenges facing the men and women in this industry and the shore-based businesses that support them are daunting, and we want to do everything we can to help them through these difficult times," Rebecca Blank, acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, said in a statement.
A statement by U.S. Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins and U.S. Reps. Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree says they're encouraged by the disaster declaration, which acknowledges that Maine's fishermen are facing new and unprecedented challenges.
The delegation's statement says the declaration is a first step in a long effort to rebuild one of the nation's first industries.
This is not the first Maine fishery to be granted disaster status, nor is it uncommon nationwide.
In 2010, for instance, shellfish harvesters in Maine were eligible for federal disaster assistance after the Commerce Department, which oversees NOAA, declared that the 2009 outbreak of red tide created a commercial fishing failure.
Two other fisheries -- salmon in Alaska and oysters and crabs in Mississippi -- also were declared disasters on Thursday.
Numerous fishermen's organizations, including the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association that Casamassa belongs to, applauded the declaration.
"NSC views federal disaster relief as an important component of a plan for 2013 and beyond," read a statement from the Northeast Seafood Coalition, whose members hold more than 500 groundfish permits.
"It provides fishermen with an essential bridge to the future when fundamental, longer-term solutions can be implemented."
Meredith Mendelson, deputy commissioner at the Maine Department of Marine Resources, said the declaration is federal acknowledgement that something other than "fishing pressure" is slowing the recovery of fish stocks.
"Fishermen have been staying within their catch limits for several years now," Mendelson.
"So it is not the fault of the industry. There is something else going on in the environment."
A May report suggested that Gulf of Maine cod populations were at 58 percent of what managers believe are healthy levels, while Georges Bank cod were at 12 percent.
As a result, federal fisheries regulators reduced the quota for 2012 and are expected to slash the catch limits further in 2013 -- some by as much as 70 percent from 2012 levels.
A letter from LePage and other governors said the money would be "used to provide both immediate economic relief to our region's struggling groundfish industry and to make targeted investments that will allow the fleet to survive and become more sustainable in the years ahead."
Although funding is not guaranteed, U.S. Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said Thursday that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has committed to include the $100 million for fishermen and fishing communities in emergency assistance legislation. That bill will be debated during the lame-duck session after the election, Kerry said Thursday. Mendelson said discussions are ongoing about how to use any emergency assistance funding appropriated by Congress.
Options include funding additional research on why groundfish are disappearing, development of new gear to better target specific species or using the money to help offset other costs, such as the amount the industry pays for at-sea catch monitors.
Another option is direct relief payments to fishermen or "buys out" of permit holders.
However, Mendelson said disaster relief for fishermen is not the same as disaster relief for farmers.
"There have been direct payments (to fishermen) in the past, but there is no insurance like crop insurance," Mendelson said.
Kerry made a similar comparison, saying fishermen are just as dependent on the vagaries of the ecosystem as farmers are and just as deserving of assistance when things go bad through no fault of their own.
"We put billions into the heartland of our country for farmers -- billions, literally," Kerry said. "When you have a massive layoff of an industry like that because of circumstances that are entirely outside the fishing industry's control, we have to respond as a country."
Casamassa said he and other fishermen hope money will be used to improve the research and science that guides NOAA catch limits.
"Nobody wants a handout. Everyone wants to fish," he said in a conference call with reporters organized by the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association and the Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fishermen's Association. "There is a problem in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, and we need to figure it out and to fix it."
Maine's congressional delegation, which had supported the state's pursuit of a disaster declaration, cheered the announcement on Thursday and pledged to continue working to secure funding.
"It is now time for Congress to support this industry by lowering operating costs for this upcoming fishing year and by investing in the resource for the long-term through scientific research to better understand these challenges," the delegation said in a joint statement. "This declaration is a first step in a long effort to rebuild one of our nation's first industries."

Full text:   I like the points Melody Weeks made in the Aug. 12 letters to the editor. You don't have to be prejudiced to deny the right to marry to everyone. There are two thoughts to consider.
The first is, the Bible lives and has changed as times have changed. We no longer put to death those who wear mixed fibers or men who sleep in the same bed with menstruating women. Widows are no longer united with their husband's brother. We can now eat pork and shellfish, and meat on Friday.
The other thought is, our government now discriminates by providing a marriage benefit to those who marry, and denies marriage to some people.
A time when the local and national budget is chronically short is not a good time to tempt legislatures to balance the budget by denying a marriage benefit, no longer being in the discrimination bind and balancing the budget.

Full text: The Portland Press Herald
TENANTS HARBOR -- At a time when most Maine lobster is processed in Canada, a young entrepreneur wants to turn the tide of the industry back toward the state with a new processing plant.
Kyle Murdock, 23, who grew up on Monhegan Island, plans to have the Sea Hag Seafood plant running by Monday in the former home of Great Eastern Mussel Farms.
At first, Sea Hag Seafood will process as much as 20,000 pounds of lobster a day. The plant has the capacity to process 40,000 pounds per day -- 4.8 million pounds in a five-month season.
In comparison, Linda Bean's Maine Lobster in Rockland, the state's third-largest processor, handles roughly 4 to 6 million pounds a year.
Despite his youth, Murdock is all business. He knows, down to the penny, what he can pay for lobster to keep the plant profitable, and knows that his profit margin depends on the one-quarter to one-half gram of lobster meat on the end of the tail.
"Mishandling the product in the slightest can eliminate profits," he said. "This business is all about the margins."
With his father, brother and uncles all working as lobstermen, Murdock grew up in the industry and was a lobsterman himself.
So starting a lobster processing plant -- and ditching his studies of physics and differential mathematics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute -- felt like the right thing to do for the industry and Maine.
"Maine has a processing problem," Murdock said. "I realized how much help the industry needed."
Sea Hag, which uses the name of Murdock's father's boat and a restaurant that his parents once owned, is on seven acres of waterfront on Long Cove in Tenants Harbor.
Murdock said he paid $455,000 for the property and spent another $350,000 renovating the long-vacant plant and installing equipment.
He assembled financing from private investors, a bank loan and Community Development Block Grant money, got a grant from Efficiency Maine to install energy-efficient equipment and got tax credits through the state's Seed Capital Tax Credit program.
Sea Hag Seafood is set to open in the wake of a battle over prices that Canadian processing plants pay for lobster, and as lobstermen get nearly historic low prices for their catch.
Earlier this month, angry Canadian fishermen blocked trucks carrying Maine lobsters to Canadian processing plants, saying the price was too low. The protests shut down several lobster processors for days, until the processors won a 10-day injunction against the protestors.
Late last week, the Maritime Fishermen's Union, which represents New Brunswick's lobstermen, reached a deal to ensure that Canadian lobstermen will receive $3.50 per pound for lobster from New Brunswick's processors.
"Canada always has a lot of drama. The lobstermen always strike before the season starts," Murdock said. "It's a publicity stunt."
Seventy-five percent of the lobster catch in the United States and Canada gets processed, rather than sold live, and Canada controls more than 90 percent of the processing market, according to the Lobster Institute at the University of Maine.
Murdock wants to ease Maine's dependence on Canada by adding capacity in the state. "The buying stations and fishermen are desperate for a place to sell," he said.
He says Sea Hag Seafood can compete against Canada's 32 processing plants, which receive government subsidies, because the Maine lobster season is longer and he will have lower trucking costs because he's closer to the Maine catch.
If the plant gets started next week as scheduled, Sea Hag Seafood will break even this year, "and maybe turn some form of profit," Murdock said.
Sea Hag Seafood will rank behind Maine's three largest processing plants: Cozy Harbor Seafood in Portland, Shucks Maine Lobster in Richmond, and Maine Lobster in Rockland.
Maine Coast Shellfish in York also processes lobster. Two other plants closed earlier this year: Live Lobster in Gouldsboro and Portland Shellfish Co., which was closed by federal regulators in April for violations of federal laws and health regulations.
Though doubters contend that Murdock will have a tough time getting enough lobsters to keep his plant running, or enough connections among dealers and buyers, Murdock said he's got contracts and plenty of suppliers.
"Having grown up in the area and the industry, I have a lot of connections with dealers and lobstermen," he said.
Still, he has had his challenges.
Finding workers continues to be a challenge, with the plant due to open in less than a week. He needs at least 35 to 40 workers to get the plant going. As of Monday, he had about half that many.
Eventually, the plant could have more than 100 workers. But getting to that level will be tough.
Murdock will pay $8 an hour to start, with shifts running eight to 10 hours a day, six days a week. Minimum wage in Maine is $7.50 an hour.
"Finding employees has turned into a little bit of a problem," Murdock admits. "We've got some good people, people who can work and learn. Nobody in this area has done processing before, everyone has to be trained."
Murdock will employ some inmates from the state's Bolduc Correctional Facility in nearby Warren, and workers from an employment firm.
The unemployment rate in Knox County was 6.4 percent in June, below Maine's overall rate of 7.5 percent.
"We've had quite a few applicants, but we need people who are willing to work six days a week," Murdock said.
Linda Bean made similar comments last week, saying it's difficult to find people to work for $8 or $9 an hour processing lobster.
"We need all kinds of processors in Maine," Bean said, when asked about the pending opening of Sea Hag Seafood. "We need more plants but we can't sell the product for enough to get incentivized to spend $2 million on a plant, compliance and labor."
"It does speak to a broken welfare system," Murdock said. "A lot of Americans are not willing to work for minimum wage."
Regardless of low lobster prices, the expectation of another round or two of shedding -- and therefore more soft-shelled lobsters -- and the cost of finding workers, Murdock thinks Sea Hag Seafood can make a go of it.
He said, "It's all lobstermen have been talking about for years: 'We need more processing here in the state where we catch.'"

What do you get for $10,000 at a presidential campaign fundraiser?
You get your picture taken with the president -- and a lobster corn dog.
A corn dog filled with a lobster tail instead of a hot dog is just one of the Maine-centric hors d'oeuvres that will be passed around at the VIP cocktail reception for President Barack Obama on Friday afternoon in South Portland.
Donors who paid just $100 for general admission -- aka "the riffraff" -- won't even get a hot dog. The sold-out reception at the Hutchinson Union Building at Southern Maine Community College will begin at 3 p.m. with a beverage-only gathering of 1,700 people.
After Obama speaks, the $10,000 donors will move to a smaller VIP "photo reception" that is being catered by the Black Tie Co. of Portland.
Chris Weber, president of Black Tie, said she has prepared an all-Maine menu that features, in addition to the lobster corn dogs, classic Maine lobster rolls with drawn butter, Maine oysters, Duck Trap smoked salmon, Maine shrimp cocktail shooters, and Pineland Farms tenderloin beef served on baguettes.
Weber will pour wines from Cellardoor Winery in Lincolnville and Blacksmiths in South Casco. The Maine-crafted beers to be served are Gritty's Pub Style, Shipyard Export Ale, Geary's Pale Ale and Allagash White.
Guests will stand around high-top cocktail tables, because $10,000 apparently doesn't buy you a chair.
Unlike Aurora Provisions, which will cater Friday night's dinner for the president and about 100 campaign donors at the Portland Museum of Art, Weber did not have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Little is known about the dinner menu.
The Portland Press Herald has confirmed that cod from Browne Trading Market will be in one of the courses, and that two wines, a vouvray from France and a gruner veltliner from Oregon, will be served.
The Kennebec Journal reported Wednesday that the dinner will include an array of cheese from Echo Ridge Organic Cheese in Mount Vernon, including camembert, brie, coulommiers and reblochon.
When it comes to keeping the menu a secret, Barbara Skapa, owner of Echo Ridge, apparently didn't get the memo. She's had a sign posted outside her home that says "Busy Making Cheeses for the White House."
Weber wanted to hear the president speak and had already bought a ticket to the reception at SMCC when she was asked to do the catering. She had no trouble finding employees to staff the event.
"We've got about 25 people working, and I've turned down at least 50 that will work for free," Weber said. "They just want to work because they want to hear the speech, and they want to be in the same proximity as Obama. Basically, I just said, 'Everybody submit your names and I'll hand pick the people I want to work the event.' "
Weber is an old hand at working presidential events. She has catered weddings for George H.W. Bush and made barbecue for Bill Clinton. The first time she cooked for a president, it "was so nerve-wracking I don't think I slept for a week."
Then, she learned that if she just does her best, and tries not to get too hung up on the fact that Secret Service agents are standing next to her, telling her what to do and not do, everything usually turns out all right.
Weber is hoping that, this time, she'll be able to actually meet the diner in chief.
"If I get to shake his hand I'll be happy," she said, "but I don't think that's going to happen."

Full text: This year marks my 30th year at writing stories for a newspaper, 25 of them for this company. It had a different name when I started. I can't remember what it was, and it's changed hands a number of times since.
I've had more editors than I can remember. Editors seem to come and go and still I'm here. Where do they go, I wonder? I've asked the ones still around, and they don't seem to know. They just went to other papers, I suppose. I can't remember their names, and I'm sure they can't remember me. They passed by me like smoke every day I was there.
The one I've got now wasn't born when I started writing, but he seems to like me and is good at correcting my errors without wagging his finger at me.
Probably most of the others really wanted to be writers and became disenchanted and took up other lines of work. They might have gone to medical school and have become brain surgeons. Twenty-five years is a long time. You can become a pretty good brain surgeon in that time. It's possible.
It's important for a writer to have had many jobs in life. Zane Grey, who was probably the greatest Western writer of all time, was once a dentist. He sold his first book at the age of 40 and was able to give up drilling teeth.
The great Langston Hughes worked as a busboy in a hotel, Jack London was an oyster pirate, whatever that is; and Harper Lee, who wrote "To Kill a Mockingbird," was an airline ticket agent. Kurt Vonnegut sold cars, and J.K. Rowling taught English as a foreign language before Harry appeared to her.
I guess that bodes well for my future, limited as it is. Because I loved clothes and had no money, I had more after-school jobs than anyone in my family, and I had no experience to bring to any of them. I dressed windows and display centers, setting up furniture displays in department stores.
My favorite brother, a cop, got me a job as a police clerk for the St. Louis Police Department, where I watched the human comedy and tragedy of life unfold.
There, one night, I checked in a high school friend whose throat had been cut. He lived.
I watched cops try to save the life of a small boy who had swallowed a lollipop. They failed.
Cops tell great stories. I can't remember their names, but I remember those stories.
I had a paper box and route when I was 11 and had a lot of fun as a copy boy for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, in a newsroom full of smoke from cigarettes, pipes and cigars and the familiar smell of whiskey.
I freelanced for the Los Angeles Times, where a guard checked you for weapons before entering the building. After high school, when my future was a blank piece of paper, I made plastic feet in a shoe factory, where I had lunch each day out of a brown paper bag on a loading dock with old men who told me hundreds of stories about the Great Depression and "The Great War." I can't remember their faces, but I remember the stories. My other brother got me a job as a fireman on a diesel engine. That's the easiest job in the world. You simply sit looking out the window and try to keep people from walking into the train.
The engineer was a happy drunk who knew all the words to just one song - "Don't Get Around Much Anymore" - and finished an entire bottle on the run from Waukegan, Ill., to Gary, Ind., at full throttle.
I've been a reservation clerk at the Waldorf Astoria in New York and a date for debutantes who couldn't get one for the ball. Now, near the end of my sidewalk, I'm a cook and live-in housekeeper for a famous teacher. It's almost easier than keeping people from walking into trains.

Augusta plan board
eyes zone change
AUGUSTA -- The Planning Board will meet tonight for a public hearing on a proposal to change the Land Use Ordinance to allow light industrial uses the Rural Residential zone, or in only part of that residential zone along a portion of Route 17.
The zoning change is under consideration in response to a local businessman's potential business processing live mussels imported from Newfoundland in a large saltwater tank, which would be built on property behind the headquarters of Uncle Henry's on Route 17.
Joseph Sutton, who also owns Uncle Henry's, a classified advertising publication, hasn't submitted a formal proposal for the new shellfish business to the city, but a consultant has discussed the proposal with city planners.
The city, according to deputy development director Matt Nazar, considers mussel processing to be food processing, which in turn is considered a light industrial use. Such as use is not allowed in the Rural Residential zoning district, which includes the Route 17 site.
The board are considering a proposal to recommend the City Council change the Land Use Ordinance to allow light industrial uses along part of Route 17 as either a permitted or conditional use. A conditional use would require any such projects to undergo Planning Board review.
The Planning Board meets 7 p.m. in the lecture hall at Augusta City Center.

Full text: Staff Writer
AUGUSTA -- The city may seem to be an unusual spot to start a business breeding tropical fish.
After all, Maine's capital is about an hour's drive from the ocean and its climate is far from tropical.
But city officials have learned that a local businessman wants to do just that: open an indoor tropical fish breeding operation with between 200 and 400 individual small breeding tanks. The breeding area would be part of a larger aquaculture operation that could also process live mussels imported from Newfoundland in a large saltwater tank for resale.
"In Maine, aquaculture usually means cold water food fish, like salmon raised in pens in the ocean. But not in this case," said Matt Nazar, deputy development director for the city of Augusta. "This type of aquaculture could occur anywhere. It's basically a big warehouse that you keep warm."
The city has not yet received an application from prospective business owner Joseph Sutton, who also co-owns the well-known Augusta-based classified advertising publication Uncle Henry's.
A representative for Sutton, though, has told city officials that the businessman hopes to breed tropical fish to be sold to pet stores, and process imported mussels and possibly clams in a saltwater habitat. The operation would be housed in a new building to be constructed behind the Uncle Henry's on Route 17, at 525 Eastern Ave.
'From reef to pet stores'
In anticipation of the proposal, city councilors have asked the Planning Board to study the issue and the city's zoning. The review began last week.
Such an aquaculture operation is not explicitly an allowed use in any of the city's zoning districts.
After lengthy debate, planners voted Tuesday to recommend the City Council modify the Land Use Ordinance to allow aquaculture as a conditional use in all zones where agriculture -- or traditional land-based-farming -- is already allowed.
Nazar said agriculture is an allowed use in many zones in Augusta, including the rural residential zone surrounding the potential new fish breeding site on Route 17.
Adding aquaculture, as a conditional use, to any zone where agriculture is allowed now would allow businesses breeding marine animals or plants to operate in many zones in the city, pending Planning Board approval. Such review would weigh the compatibility of proposed operations to neighboring properties and provide an opportunity for public comment.
Board member A. Delaine Nye said it seemed to make sense to allow aquaculture where agriculture is allowed.
Sutton could not be reached for comment this week.
Nazar said Jim Coffin, of Augusta-based E.S. Coffin Engineering and Surveying, representing Sutton, told him that the business could house 200 to 400 breeding tanks. Each tank would measure roughly 4-by-4-by-3-feet. Nazar said Maine's harsh winter could actually be a plus for the aquaculture industry. Should a tropical fish somehow escape the breeding warehouse into nearby water, it would not be likely to survive in the wild and would not become an invasive species, he said.
Aquaculture is a fledgling industry in Maine. University of Maine graduate Soren Hansen operates Sea and Reef Aquaculture in Franklin, which also raises tropical fish for wholesale distribution to pet stores.
Nazar said most fish in pet stores are caught in the wild, and only about 5 percent survive from reef to pet store. He said the survival rate of tropical fish bred and raised in captivity is higher.
Protecting neighborhoods
Adding aquaculture as a conditional use in zones where agriculture is already allowed in Augusta would not, however, pave the way for the mussel processing aspect of the potential new business.
Nazar said shellfish processing, even involving shellfish that arrive and depart still living, is considered food processing under state, federal and city regulations. In Augusta, it's also classified as light industrial use, which is allowed in fewer locations than agriculture and not allowed in the area surrounding the potential Route 17 business site.
Planners were hesitant to change zoning rules to allow light industrial uses, such as the potential mussel processing business, in part out of concern that doing so could also allow other industrial businesses that negatively impact residential neighborhoods.
Nye noted that protecting Augusta's neighborhoods, and maintaining pleasant gateways on major routes into the city, was a key recommendation of the 2007 Comprehensive Plan.
"Right now, no matter how you come into the city, you see businesses," Nye said. "As soon as we allow manufacturing where there are houses, people coming into town are going to wonder where people in Augusta live. Where are our neighborhoods? I have issues with that.
"We want businesses in Augusta to be successful. We want them to be huge. But if they're going to be huge, we've got to be careful so we don't have them in a residential area."
Planners are scheduled to consider the light industrial zoning issue as it relates to mussel processing at their meeting on Jan. 24.

Full text: Maine Sunday Telegram
FREEPORT -- On a recent weekend, there were few hikers on the trails that wind through a pine forest at Wolfe's Neck Woods State Park before opening up to views of seabird nesting islands and mud flats.
Out on the flats, Sanford Metayer was easy to make out, all alone among the rising sea gulls, raking for clams. As birds scooped up shellfish to hoist into the air, drop and crack on nearby rocks, Metayer collected his own bucket of steamers, feeling lucky to live in Maine. He came to Wolfe's Neck park as a volunteer outdoor educator last Sunday to extend that message to park visitors.
"A lot of people think it's too cold to be digging for clams now," said Metayer of Lewiston, in a deep, gravely voice. "They're like, 'No, I'll go get my clams at the store.' But I like being out here, hearing the seagulls, the tide. This is my enjoyment. I love the smell of the ocean."
Metayer is a recreational clammer, lover of this outdoor playground, and a faithful volunteer at the coastal state park. His favorite activity also is a fine example of the hands-on programs state parks are offering this winter to get more Mainers outside.
Over the next three months, more special events will be held and new activities and programs rolled out at the parks, said Gary Best, Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands interpretive specialist.
"We want to get more people outdoors during winter, get them to our state parks, so we've provided more opportunities to do things across the state," Best said.
To start off, the four-year-old Winter Family Fun Days will offer activities at five parks.
For example, at Mount Blue State Park in Weld, where one of the most elaborate Winter Fun Days takes place, park staff will offer skating instruction, a monstrous sledding run, ice caves and lessons in winter camping.
The Bureau of Parks and Lands will bring a new trailer full of 60 sets of cross country skis, all free to try, to parks across the state, compliments of a $4,900 Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund grant.
It's about the idea that if you build it or bring it, they'll come.
"At all the events we try to identify barriers that are keeping people from getting outside in the winter and trying new things," Best said. "We want to break down those barriers. If one is equipment, we have cross country skis, snowshoes and ice traps. We want to make it easy to come out and try something new."
"First Day Hikes" on New Year's Day will be offered for the first time at four parks: Wolfe's Neck Woods, Popham Beach, Cobscook Bay and Aroostook state parks.
The events are cheap. After the cost of park admission -- $1.50 for those ages 12 to 64 -- everything is free. And the groomed cross country ski trails and skating ponds at the parks are not just available at the winter fun days, but all winter long, Best said.
Wolfe's Neck Woods already promotes winter fun better than most parks.
Wolfe's Neck Woods has always held year-round nature programs. Land for the park was donated to the state in 1969, along with an endowment to fund environmental education.
With the park's 40th anniversary coming up in 2012, park manager Andy Hutchinson said he plans to add programs and teach more outdoor skills this winter. The park will have a fleet of snowshoes to rent for the first time this year.
Over the past six years, Metayer's clamming demonstrations have been observed by as many as 20 and 30 visitors. He offers the seminar for a couple of reasons.
For one, his family loves steamers. Second, clamming at state parks is free. So long as park visitors follow state clamming regulations, they are welcome to dig for the tasty mollusks and collect dinner, same as at Cobscook Bay State Park or Lemoine or Popham Beach state parks.
"Although ours are sweeter," Hutchinson said with a smile.
More of these opportunities are being offered as park managers entice Mainers to play outdoors during the cold months.
"Sanford is but one of the volunteers we bring in. He teaches the hints, how to dig quicker and better," Hutchinson said. "I do the national history piece, how the park has shell middens, how the Native Americans used it as a survival food in March after ice out. The shells with the purple mark were used by the Wabanaki people for trading. It's still a valuable natural resource in Maine."

UNITY -- When life gives people lemons, some make lemonade.
When life gives Clem Blakney sour grapes, or Prairie Star, Niagara, La Crosse, Mars or Reliance grapes, he makes wine.
Blakney owns and operates Younity Winery & Vineyards on Albion Road. He and his wife, Jeri established the vineyards in May 2007 and registered Unity Winery in 2009.
Soon after, they were notified that a winery in California had trademarked the word "Unity."
"We took what could be considered a bad situation and turned it into an opportunity," Blakney said. "Do not let adversity set you back."
Blakney, who enjoys plays on words, said he considers "you," or each individual customer, to be the "Maine ingredient" in his wine. So he tweaked the name of the business to Younity Winery & Vineyards. The couple enjoy coining catchy names for their wines, all of which are made with Maine grapes and other Maine fruits.
For instance, their cranberry wine, which is pale pink, bubbly and slightly sweet, is called Tickled Pink.
The rhubarb wine, a semi-dry white, is named Rhuby Slippers.
Star Crossed, a dry white wine, is made by combining Prairie Star grapes with Lacrosse grapes.
Somethin' Blue, a full wine made from wild blueberries, has an apt name to be served at weddings.
The Palmer Sisters, a spicy, complicated elderberry wine aged with oak chips, is named for Clem Blakney's grandfather's sisters.
And, Over A Barrel, which has a fruity, slightly sweet taste, is made with Niagara green grapes.
Blakney envisions a nonalcoholic homage to John Wayne made from grape juice called John Wyne.
Connie Bellet, an artist living in Palermo, designs delightfully themed labels around the Blakneys' creative names and concepts.
Her label for Tickled Pink features an ecstatic dancing pink hippopotamus wearing a tutu.
She imagined green rhubarb leaves in the shape of elegant footwear for Rhuby Slippers.
For the Star Crossed wine, Bellet created a Romeo-and-Juliet-style scene with a male suitor standing below a balcony on which his lover stands. Grapevines frame the balcony and above the star-crossed lovers, a night sky is alive with twinkling stars and a moon with a man in it.
Blakney described the Palmer Sisters, who all lived to ripe old ages, as spinster teetotalers. Bellet's label shows three women wearing hats seated at a table. A fourth, who is standing, clutches a bottle of wine behind her back.
On the Over A Barrel label, a hand holding a wine glass sticks out of a small hole in a wooden barrel as it plunges over a steep waterfall.
The designer labels have been so popular, Blakney said, that guests at wine tastings want to purchase the artwork on posters.
Blakney, 60, learned about making wine from his father in Washington state.
After he moved to Maine a few years ago, his hobby turned into a business venture.
Each of the 1,200 vines in the vineyard stretching alongside Albion Road, produces about 10 pounds of grapes.
"The yield increases every year," he said.
Someday, Blakney said, each vine might produce 20 pounds of fruit. Maine's grape-growing season runs from June to September and Blakney said vines can climb six to eight feet each season.
Grapes and vines are like children, he is fond of saying.
"Every one has a personality," said Blakney, who sings to grapes while he prunes vines.
"If you let them go wild, you pay for it," he said. "You have to nourish and guide them and they'll grow up rewarding you."
Blakney said the entire process is satisfying -- from planting vines to sipping wine with guests in his cozy tasting room, which contains a small wooden bar, stained glass lights, and a view of the vineyard.
"I want to get people enthusiastic about wine," he said. "The more wineries, the better it is."
People will appreciate Maine wineries even more, he said, if there is a whole bunch. "You see one grape, you say, 'What's wrong with that?' You see a cluster and you say, Wow!'"
Younity Winery & Vineyards is one of 15 members of The Maine Winery Guild dotting The Maine Wine Trail, which winds from Prospect Hill Winery in Lebanon to Dragonfly Winery in Stetson, to Shalom Organic Orchard Farm & Winery in Franklin, to Oyster River Winegrowers in Thomaston.
Guild members open their vineyards and tasting rooms to the public.
Next to Blakney's tasting room, in the basement of the home, wine ages in two 120-gallon barrels.
Blakney said each barrel, which is covered in homemade cheesecloth, produces about 500 bottles of wine.
"Never judge a wine on the first taste," he said. "The first wakes up your taste buds; the second taste is the true flavor."
And if a batch of wine doesn't turn out as he wished, well, that's part of life. "Do not be afraid you might get your toes stepped on," he said. "If you don't stick your feet out, you never move forward."
Wise words from a man who is barefoot most of the time.
"I like to feel the earth with my feet," he said, explaining that as a child, to save his shoes from getting scuffed on gravel roads, he walked with his shoes slung over his shoulder.
Mistakes, said the self-described barefoot vintner, are opportunities to learn. And Blakney rather relishes them.
When a batch of Somethin' Blue didn't taste quite right for wine, it became a tasty, tangy spread for crackers -- BB's Maine Blueberry Sting.
"Beware of a wicked sting" reads a warning on the label, which instructs users to shake, open and devour.
Blakney said his tasting room will likely be open for a couple of weekends before Christmas, then he will hibernate and remodel until spring.
Calling ahead is recommended for those interested in a weekend wine-tasting, conversation and a walk with Blakney through the vineyard.
Those who get his answering machine will hear his cheerful voice say, "Drop in, we can talk. And certainly we can drink."

Full text: PORTLAND (AP) -- The tropical storms that drenched the Northeast this year left an unexpected bounty: Thousands of mushrooms have sprung up on some lawns, and foragers have filled bags with wild ones plucked from the earth, stumps and logs.
"It was like a scene from 'Alice and Wonderland,'" said David Fischer, who wrote "Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America."
The mushrooms are providing good meals for people like Margaret Primack of Newton, Mass., who collected 60 to 70 pounds this summer. But because some mushrooms are poisonous, they also present a danger for people who can't tell the difference between the tasty and the toxic.
The Northern New England Poison Center has seen an increase in mushroom poisoning cases in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, with 97 in August and September, nearly double the figure from the same time last year.
"People need to have respect for mushrooms," said Karen Simone, the poison center's director. "They don't understand that this can be dangerous."
Different mushrooms types can look similar, and it takes a trained eye to tell the difference between those that are safe and those that are deadly. Mushroom and health experts discourage people from eating wild mushrooms unless they're absolutely sure they're safe.
"If somebody eats the wrong thing, they could be dead, and it's not a fun way to go," said Fischer, who also runs a website dedicated to wild mushrooms from his home in Syracuse, N.Y.
Consumers who are worried about safety can buy mushrooms from the nation's commercial growers, who produce the white button mushrooms commonly used on salads and pizzas, along with shiitake, Portobello and oyster mushrooms.
Commercial mushroom production also is up, topping $1 billion for the first time in the 2010-11 growing season, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's an 8 percent increase from the previous year. Pennsylvania is the leading mushroom state, producing more than half of the nation's commercial crop.
Mushrooms thrive in wet weather and there's been no shortage in the Northeast. Most of the region had more rain than usual in August and September, with cities like Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia setting two-month records. Almost 30 inches of rain were recorded in New York's Central Park during that time.
The downpour didn't help spring mushrooms like morels, but it boosted other species like black trumpets, chanterelles and hen-of-the-woods, which can weigh 20 to 30 pounds each. Hundreds of common mushrooms, and sometimes more, appeared on lawns and golf courses.
"This has been a special year. Some people say it's the best that they've ever seen," said Cynthia Kowal, a senior research administrator at Boston University, member of the Boston Mycological Society and amateur forager who collects mushrooms in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
Mycology is the study of fungi. Both amateur and professional mycologists tend to be a passionate group, photographing and documenting mushrooms, sharing and identifying them and discussing them in online forums.
This year, the volume and variety of mushrooms has given them plenty to talk about. There are lobster mushrooms, so-called because of their red color; shaggy manes, an edible lawn mushroom; stinkhorn mushrooms, which emit an unpleasant odor; and chanterelles, prized among epicureans.
Candice Heydon, a mushroom grower and broker in Maine, said she has had to turn away amateur pickers and foragers who've shown up at her door with bags of mushrooms, hoping to make some extra money.
Even some professional foragers have been overwhelmed.
"They're looking for one kind they're going to get paid for. When they see so many, they're distracted," said Heydon, who owns Oyster Creek Mushroom Co. in Damariscotta.
David Spahr, who collects and studies mushrooms, said the volume of black trumpets is the biggest he's seen in 40 years of foraging.
"That gets people excited because black trumpets are the best-tasting mushrooms in the woods," he said from his home in Washington, Maine.
Spahr cautioned that it's not just rain that's responsible for the widespread fungi this summer and fall. Mushrooms are a bit of a mystery and are not well understood, he said, and even experts don't fully understand why some years are better than others.
That's no concern for Primack, a middle school teacher, and her husband, Richard. They're just grateful for the bounty they're enjoying this year.
"People normally add mushrooms as a garnish for dishes. This year they're so abundant that we have whole large bowls of mushrooms for dinner," said Richard Primack, a biology professor at Boston University. "Our freezer is filled with mushrooms. We're having difficulty finding space for the ice cream."

WATERVILLE -- In real estate, it's all about location.
In the world of edible, wild-mushroom gathering, it's all about timing.
"Timing, timing, timing," mushroom hobbyist and presenter Richard Tory of Canaan told a group of more than 100 people Sunday during an open-air workshop at the Quarry Road Recreation Area. "The seasons; what time of year to look for them -- right after a rain. Not too cold, not too hot, not too dry. The right amount of water."
Sunday's workshop and self-guided mushroom tour of the trails and woods surrounding the recreation area were sponsored by Kennebec Messalonskee Trails.
Foraging, identifying and preparing fungi for the table also is about safety, said Tory, a vegetarian for the past 40 years.
"People need to make sure they identify very carefully what they eat," he said displaying a series of local mushrooms that are good -- and safe -- to eat. "Poisoning cases at hospitals in Maine are up this year. You have to be very careful; you have to really learn how to identify species and try to avoid the other ones.
"Be observant, curious and patient. There are old mushroom hunters and there are bold mushroom hunters, but there are no old, bold mushroom hunters."
The first rule of foraging fearlessly for fungi is to buy and use a good field guide, to learn where the safe, "choice" ones grow and when they grow, Tory said. He recommends learning the identity of the top 10 varieties that grow in central Maine.
There is the oyster mushroom, the chicken mushroom and hedgehog mushroom. There are shaggy manes, bear's head tooth, black trumpet and wine cap, he said of some of the mushrooms that flourish in Maine this time of year, especially after a wet summer.
Some of the tips shared by Tory Sunday included avoiding "little brown mushrooms" and "little white mushrooms." Use only firm and "non-buggy" specimens, he said. Usually mushrooms without "gills" are the safest to eat, he said.
Tory told enthusiasts Sunday to make sure they cook the mushrooms, to eat them in moderation and to be careful of alcohol consumption while eating mushrooms.
Fred Murphy of Waterville was among the many visitors to the workshop who were anxious to learn more about the tasty, wild treat.
"I'm interested in understanding mushrooms," Murphy said. "I want to know what ones I might be safe in picking out back of my house because I own a wood lot that might have some in it."
Murphy said he wanted to take a piece of the bear's head tooth mushroom to try to "inoculate" the trees on his land with the spores from the sample.
Heather Tompkins of Waterville said she had not actually tasted the mushroom selections being circulated through the crowd Sunday, but said she wanted to know more.
"We see mushrooms all over the place and wanted to get a sense of what they are," she said. "I've never really looked into it before, so I wouldn't feel quite ready to eat them. I'm thinking of getting a field guide for them."
Workshop attendee Steve Frederick of Norridgewock said that with recent interest in eating locally and the general state of the economy, he and others may have to look to the woods more for food -- like mushrooms.
"I pick mushrooms, but I wanted to identify more," he said. "For every one I pick, there's probably 10 varieties that I don't know if they're good or not. I think this is very informative. I'm glad I came."

Full text: State House Bureau
AUGUSTA -- A highly anticipated report on the state Department of Marine Resources offers plenty of recommendations but few revelations.
In light of the abrupt resignation of Norman Olsen as Gov. Paul LePage's marine resources commissioner in July, there was speculation that the independent audit would contain sharp criticism of the department or shed further light on the circumstances surrounding Olsen's departure.
Ultimately, the 90-page document drafted by three out-of-state experts picked by Olsen cited several concerns that have been topics of discussion in Maine's fishing industry in recent years:
* Criticism of the Department of Marine Resources' structure and effectiveness.
* Skepticism about the sustainability of recent record-breaking lobster harvests.
* Concern that the already cash-strapped department will have fewer resources in the near future.
Insiders in the industry apparently did not spend their weekend reading the report, which was released Friday.
Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, said she's looking forward to reviewing it, "however, I have not yet received a copy."
LePage's press office issued a news release Friday afternoon containing a link to the report, which is on the Department of Marine Resources' website.
Rep. Windol Weaver, R-York, House chairman of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee, said Monday that he was just beginning to review the report.
Others contacted Monday for their thoughts on the report declined to comment because they hadn't looked it over.
Despite the report's low profile so far, Weaver predicted that it will be the focus of much of his committee's work during the legislative session that starts in January.
"I guess it's good advice and an outside evaluation that the department's probably needed for many years," he said, "so it gives us a good starting point."
The audit was done by David Wallace, who has owned seafood processing companies and fishing boats in his 45 years in the industry; W. "Pete" Jensen, whose career in natural resources management includes work with the National Marine Fisheries Service; and David Borden, who has been in fisheries management for 38 years, according to the report.
The review contains more than three dozen recommendations, ranging from staffing and fiscal matters to fishery management, lobster processing and aquaculture.
It says, "The department should be restructured and activities prioritized around a strong legislative policy requiring sustainable resource management based on management plans with clear objectives and goals."
It also says that, based on interviews with dozens of department staffers and lawmakers, "one particular concern was that the continued increase in the harvest of lobsters that is largely unexplained may not be sustainable but there were no efforts underway to constrain the harvest to an identified sustainable level."
Maine lobster landings averaged about 20 million pounds a year from 1950 to 1990, according to the report. More than 94 million pounds were landed in 2010.
The number of lobster traps increased from 430,000 in 1950 to 2.6 million in 1996. Now, there are more than 3 million traps for 5,977 lobstermen, according to the report.
The audit says that because it is not clear why the yield has been so plentiful in recent years it would be "prudent to initiate a process to slowly transition the industry away from several practices that we view as undesirable and/or damaging in order to promote the long-term viability of stock and industry."
The authors recommend that the state gradually reduce the number of traps "in a very predictable and transparent way."
Weaver, the lawmaker from York, said he doesn't believe that lobsters are being overfished but he agrees that the industry likely faces changes.
"We're going to look at that (number of traps) because we've got to do something about it, but also we're having a problem with letting new people into the industry," he said, because entry is now restricted.
He agreed with the report's evaluation that the Department of Marine Resources -- in charge of one of Maine's most lucrative industries -- is running on a shoestring budget and is likely to get less federal money.
"It's getting very tough and we're looking for more money, but you know the state doesn't have it, the federal government doesn't have it. The options are to increase license fees," he said, acknowledging that doing so would upset fishermen.
"You try and work with them and see what you can do, but sometimes you may have to do something that's not pleasant, and I hope we don't, but it's getting serious, as indicated by this report," Weaver said.
On the upside, the report highlights potential for expanding the industry for shellfish processing and expanding aquaculture opportunities by streamlining government permitting.
Adrienne Bennett, spokeswoman for LePage, said Monday that the administration is not prepared to discuss plans for following up on the report's recommendations until specific legislation is drafted.

BATH -- The Army Corps of Engineers' dredging of the Kennebec River is complete, and Bath Iron Works launched its latest destroyer by the Navy's Sept. 1 deadline. However, concerns about the future effect of the off-season project on juvenile lobster and clams persist among harvesters, environmentalists and residents.
Officials at the Maine Department of Environmental Protection said no significant harm was caused, and the Sept. 1 departure of the USS Spruance was a success on more than one front.
The Navy ship made safe passage down the Kennebec River on its maiden voyage, the summer catch was left unharmed by the Army Corps of Engineers project, and state marine officials reported there were no documented takes of endangered salmon or sturgeon.
In order to ensure the warship's safe passage, the corps dredged sand that had built up near Doubling Point and at the mouth of the river, and it dumped the material in an area of the river north of Bluff Head, known as The Narrows, and by Jackknife Ledge near Popham Beach.
The dredging was completed Aug. 14.
The project got a lot of public attention because it was done at the height of fishing and tourism season, unlike in previous years.
According to a report from the corps, "Steps were taken to minimize potential adverse impacts of the discharge on the aquatic ecosystem."
DEP spokeswoman Samantha DePoy-Warren said clam flats remained open after the dredging project on Aug. 18; and after the Corps dumped the dredging material by Jackknife Ledge, lobstermen hauled in traps to find lobsters inside.
As far as the endangered species observer aboard the dredging ship could tell, no endangered fish were killed during the process, DePoy-Warren said.
The question of how the dredging and dumping affected juvenile marine life will have to wait longer for an answer.
There were fears that the dredging might have stirred up fecal matter carried by the river from soil erosion, rain and antiquated septic systems and farms. The state Department of Marine Resources tested for fecal contamination at 11 additional sites along the river before and after the dredging project, and tests came back clean. The river remains open to clam digging.
Before the project started, the corps was required to have a suitability determination test to show the elements that were to be dredged up.
Bob Greene, project manager for the DEP, said the department determined 98 percent of the material was sand and that contaminants would adhere to other sediments, but not sand.
As a result of the finding, Greene and his staff determined that any additional testing for metals and other contaminants was not merited.
The Department of Marine Resources doesn't test for metals and other contaminants settled into the river bottom, either, according to Fran Pierce, who monitors water quality in shellfish growing areas for the department.
Pierce said they also don't have a way to test the effects of the dredging on juvenile clams and lobsters, the results of which local harvesters have said would not be realized for three or four years after dredging.
"Even at that point, how could you definitely say whether it was caused by the dredging?" Pierce said.
Tests need to be taken in advance of dredging to establish a baseline, and then tests would need to be taken years after.
"It would be a pretty involved study," Pierce said. "We just don't have the staff."
A small staff working for DMR monitors the entire ragged Maine coastline -- about 3,500 miles -- to measure shellfish health.
Greene said they did not measure the effect of the dredging on juvenile lobsters and clams for the Spruance dredging.
He did not think dumping material at Jackknife Ledge, which many local lobstermen view as a prime summer lobster fishery, would harm young lobsters. He also said they relied heavily on previous projects and information gleaned from local lobstermen.
Greene said lobsters would not migrate out of a dumping area permanently; they just get out of the way of the disturbance area, then return to the same spot over time.
"That is what I've been told by people who have been involved in the lobster industry," Greene said.
In recent years, shellfish harvesters have become increasingly involved in the health and sustainability of clam flats. When the state and clam diggers clashed about a series of flat closures, it sparked awareness of the need to monitor pollution levels and reseed flats.
"There's much more interest at the local level and many parties are involved," Pierce said. "It's really great. The public is much more aware."
Regarding the effect of dredging silt on clam spat -- juvenile clams planted by local diggers for future harvests -- Greene was less sure.
"I don't think anybody knows," he said.
However, he said there was little concern. Of the material dredged, about 2 percent of it was silt, Greene said.
Two percent of 50 yards over the vast acreage of clam flats would total about 0.016 inches of silt thickness, Greene said. That amount of silty material would not cover evenly, nor remain in one place for any length of time.
"We made the determination there wouldn't be an unreasonable impact on the clam flats. From a physical perspective, there was just not enough silt to cover the spat," Greene said.
He said it would be difficult to develop the methodology to measure the specific impacts of silt on clam flats.
"There are a lot of mitigating circumstances why we haven't done post-dredging monitoring," he said. He added that his department doesn't have enough data to indicate what the silty material's effect would be to warrant a study.
"Yes, there's going to be an impact, but not enough to warrant the staff or the cost."

Full text: READFIELD -- Marc Loiselle built his home to code.
His Cape on the outskirts of the village is well insulated, has proper wiring and an air-exchange system that keeps it cozy in winter, cool in summer.
"Then you drill a well, and surprise!" Loiselle said. "Most people assume it's fresh, pure, natural water, and perfectly safe to drink."
Eventually, Loiselle found out his wasn't. After he built his Sturtevant Hill Road home in 1995, he had his well tested as part of a Columbia University study.
It showed arsenic in his drinking water at 30 parts per billion.
"At the time we drilled, I presumed the risk to be minimal," said Loiselle, a retired hydrologist. "It was below the contaminated level, so we didn't do anything."
Then, in 2002, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency strengthened the standard, moving it from 50 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion.
Loiselle's is hardly the only home in Maine with toxic levels of arsenic in its well water.
Using data from more than 11,000 wells in 530 Maine municipalities, a landmark U.S. Geological Survey study released in 2010 showed, for the first time, three high-arsenic clusters: the southern coast, Down East and Greater Augusta.
Columbia University followed up those results and estimated 31 percent of private wells in Greater Augusta contain arsenic above the federal standard. Arsenic found in some private wells sampled by Columbia researchers exceeded the standard by 10 to more than 100 times.
Using various analytical methods, Columbia researchers say 12,293 to 15,561 Kennebec County residents are drinking from private wells that have toxic levels of arsenic, which has been linked to increased risk of skin, lung and bladder cancer; developmental problems in children; diabetes; and undesirable effects on the immune system.
The problem -- naturally occurring from underlying rock -- is particularly prevalent in Readfield and Manchester, and in a band along the western edge of the county from Winthrop and Monmouth south through Hallowell and Litchfield.
The solution is fairly simple: a water test for $15 to $25 and, if deemed toxic, a filtration system that can cost as little as a few hundred dollars.
But many are still in the dark about the problem. Standards continue to evolve. And Maine does not require any testing of private wells, on which 74 percent of Kennebec County homes rely for potable water, according to U.S. Census data.
It's in the rocks
Loiselle, 61, was at least prepared to deal with the results of his water test: He'd dealt with enough water supplies during his career as a Maine Geological Survey hydrogeologist to know the risks of arsenic.
He said he knew arsenic is a part of the earth's crust and occurs naturally in central Maine's soil and rocks.
The Columbia study found arsenic correlates with certain types of bedrock, in particular: Silurian meta-sedimentary, Devonian granite and Ordovician-Cambrian volcanic rocks.
State Geologist Robert Marvinney said arsenic is absorbed into ground water as it flows through fractured bedrock.
Development and blasting may change the way fractures are connected, allowing water with more arsenic to reach a well it once didn't. Such situations are rare, he said.
Arsenic compounds also were widely used as pesticides and herbicides in the 20th century. Such use has been discontinued, but Marvinney said it's possible some arsenic found in Maine's ground water may be from such sources.
"Arsenic is common in many minerals found in Maine and other parts of the country, particularly . . . compounds with sulfur," Marvinney said. "Sulfide minerals can be found throughout the metamorphic rocks that underlie much of central and southern Maine. Arsenic is also fairly mobile within a few hundred feet of the surface, meaning conditions can cause it to be leached from the minerals into water fairly readily."
Marvinney said Maine has known about its arsenic problem since at least the 1990s, when the Maine Geological Survey and Maine Centers for Disease Control first documented high levels in Buxton and Hollis.
The highest arsenic concentration found thus far in Maine well water was in Danforth.
At 3,100 parts per billion, the Danforth well is comparable to some found in Bangladesh, a developing south Asian nation where an estimated 50 million people are chronically exposed to toxic levels of arsenic in drinking water.
The World Health Organization has called Bangladesh's arsenic crisis "the largest mass poisoning of a population in history."
Marvinney said most of the occurrences in Maine are much lower than the well in Danforth. But health officials were alarmed nonetheless by some of the readings here -- and by data linking high arsenic levels to poor brain development in Bangladeshi children.
When elevated arsenic levels were found in private wells where they were not previously suspected, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted the largest study of its kind in Maine, from 2005 to 2009, to detect and map the state's high-arsenic wells.
The findings were clear: Kennebec County is an arsenic hot spot.
Of the top 10 Maine municipalities with wells exceeding the federal limit for arsenic, half are in Kennebec County -- with Manchester, at 62 percent of wells, the state's worst.
Other local hot spots include Readfield, with 49 percent of wells exceeding federal limits; Winthrop, with 46 percent; Monmouth, 45 percent; and Litchfield, 42 percent.
'Urgent public health issue'
Arsenic -- a known carcinogen -- is found in a wide variety of chemical forms in the environment. It has been used for leather and wood treatments, pesticides, metals and alloys, petroleum refining and other industrial applications.
In powder form, it has been used as a rat poison. Arsenic was in the news in 2003 when a man poisoned the coffee urn at a New Sweden church, sickening 15 parishioners and killing one.
It's also naturally occurring in many foods, including rice.
Sparked by health data that showed ill effects from arsenic exposure, Columbia University began a five-year arsenic study of children in Bangladesh in 2000 to see how the substance affected brain development.
Joseph Graziano, program director for the Strategic Plan for Arsenic Research in Kids study, said groups of 50 Bangladeshi children were given a standardized test.
The first group, which had the lowest arsenic concentrations in their drinking water -- below 5 parts per billion -- scored an average 76 on the test.
The second group -- which drank water with arsenic levels at 5 to 50 parts per billion -- scored an average of 71.
The third group -- which drank water with arsenic at 50 to 176 parts per billion -- scored an average 68.
The final group -- which drank water with arsenic at 177 to 800 parts per billion -- had the lowest average score, 65.
"We know that poor nutrition exasperates the concentration of arsenic -- and we know precisely why," Graziano said. "There are certain nutrients -- folate and selenium -- that really antagonize the toxicity of arsenic, and folate deficiencies are common in Bangladesh.
"The study we're doing in Maine and New Hampshire is looking at children who have better nutrition than Bangladesh and much less exposures than Bangladesh, where you're seeing numbers ranging up to 800 (ppb), which we don't see in Maine."
Graziano said the results of the SPARK study -- which focused on children in Greater Augusta and southern Maine, as well as children from New Hampshire -- will be released within the next few months.
He said little is known of short-term exposure.
But a 2006 study conducted in Chile by the University of California at Berkeley and Chilean researchers found links between arsenic exposure in-utero and lung disease in children.
The study found that Chileans exposed to arsenic only as children had a death rate from lung cancer seven times greater than the rest of the country. The death rate from bronchiectasis was 12 times greater.
For those with both early childhood and in-utero exposure, the death rate from lung cancer was six times greater than that for the rest of Chile, and the death rate from bronchiectasis -- a condition in which damage to the airways causes them to widen and become flabby and scarred -- was an astonishing 46 times greater.
The study's lead author, University of California at Berkeley epidemiology professor Allan Smith, said the findings provided some of the first evidence that fetal or early childhood exposure to any toxic substance can increase disease rates in adults.
"The extraordinary risk we found for in-utero and early childhood exposure is a new scientific finding," he said. "I sometimes ponder the improbability that drinking water with concentrations of arsenic less than one-thousandth of a gram per liter could do this, and think that I've got to be wrong.
"But our years of working with arsenic exposure in India and Chile tie in with this study perfectly."
Graziano agreed: Studies show people exposed to arsenic in fetal life have poor lung function as adults.
"Those pulmonary function tests showed their lungs were impaired by about 10 percent just from having been exposed in fetal life," Graziano said. "Again, we shouldn't propagate fear -- because much of the work is not done in U.S. populations. But (effects from arsenic are being seen in) relatively disadvantaged populations and, again, we know nutrition is a big factor."
The National Research Council has concluded that even small amounts of arsenic over time can cause higher risks of skin, lung and bladder cancer.
Amanda Sears, an associate director of the Environmental Health Strategy Center, participated in a Maine Cancer Consortium work group that developed goals for the Maine Cancer Plan.
One of the goals was to promote testing for arsenic in well water through education and awareness.
Another was to increase the number of private testing laboratories.
Finally, the plan called on officials to ensure that at least 75 percent of Maine homes with private wells are tested for arsenic.
Sears said Maine needs a law to require routine testing of private well water for arsenic, especially when a home is sold or rented.
But none of these goals has been implemented.
"The prevalence of arsenic in Maine ground water, the potent carcinogenicity of arsenic and the unacceptably low level of public awareness of the arsenic threat make this an urgent public health issue," she said.
Evolving standards
The federal safety standard -- once 50 parts per billion -- has been 10 parts per billion since 2002.
But it applies only to public water systems -- not private wells, which are unregulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Well owners are responsible for testing their own water.
New Jersey established a lower standard -- 5 parts per billion -- in 2001; that same year, the National Resources Defense Council recommended in testimony before the U. S. House of Representatives a federal standard of 3 parts per billion.
The EPA said it dropped the federal limit for arsenic from 50 to 10 parts per billion to "improve public health by reducing exposure to arsenic in drinking water."
In doing so, the agency estimated the change would prevent 16 to 26 nonfatal bladder and lung cancers per year and 21 to 30 fatal bladder and lung cancers per year.
The debate continues on what is the safest level, but scientific consensus is clear: Arsenic in drinking water poses a health threat over time and must be remediated.
State toxicologist Andrew Smith said the level at which arsenic affects health depends on logical factors such as:
* how high the levels are;
* how much water a person drinks;
* how long he or she has been drinking the water; and
* who is drinking it, for example, pregnant women, infants or adults.
The estimated lifetime cancer risk from drinking water with arsenic at 10 parts per billion is one in 1,000, Smith said.
"On one hand, not a huge risk," he said. "On the other hand, a much bigger risk than that associated with most other drinking water standards."
Smith said the estimate assumes lifetime exposure and intake of about 2 quarts of water per day.
He said people ingest about 5 to 10 micrograms of arsenic each day from naturally occurring trace levels in foods, especially rice products, seafood, shellfish and algal products.
Charles Culbertson, a microbial ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Maine Water Science Center, said states can adopt their own limits -- like New Jersey did -- but they can't be more lenient than the federal standard.
"The federal government constantly reviews these types of regulatory limits as more information becomes available," he said. "In the late 1990s, studies showed that low concentrations of arsenic were a greater health concern than previously thought," which prompted the move to a tougher standard.
He said there are two forms of arsenic: organic and inorganic. The inorganic form is the most common, by far, he said, and is most responsible for well water problems.
Within the inorganic form, there are two dominant forms of arsenic: arsenic-5 and arsenic-3.
"Arsenic-3 is the most difficult form to filter out of your well water," Culbertson said. "Without getting into too much chemistry, this has to do with its electrical charge in natural waters. ... In layman's terms, arsenic-3 is not very 'sticky' and therefore does not interact or react with common filtration material used to remove arsenic.
Arsenic-5 is quite sticky, Culbertson said, because it has an electrical charge in natural waters.
Consequently, it's quite easy to remove, as it reacts and interacts with a variety of material used in common arsenic filtration systems.
"Both forms are considered toxic," he said, "arsenic-3 perhaps slightly more so."
Advocates encourage anyone getting a well test to have the lab specify what the arsenic-5 and arsenic-3 levels are, in order to make the best filtration decision.
Battling for protection
Culbertson said homeowners should consult reputable companies when seeking arsenic filtration systems.
For example, a good treatment company will be aware of the fact that there are two forms of arsenic requiring alternate treatment methods.
"A lot of plumbers and do-it-yourself homeowners are not aware of these issues, and think one size fits all when it comes to buying an arsenic filtration system for their home," he said.
Andrews Tolman, assistant director of the state's Drinking Water Program, said the Legislature has taken up the issue of private well testing in the past, but requiring it has met with opposition -- mostly from the real estate industry.
There also have been discussions about licensing companies that install water mitigation systems, Tolman said.
Nothing has come of that, either.
"The Legislature has not been willing to mandate even testing, so I suspect that regulation of private well quality is not politically viable," Tolman said. "We and our colleagues in the Environmental and Occupational Health Program have worked on education and outreach to help private well owners understand the risk of using a well without testing and, if needed, treatment."
Tolman said there are several removal methods.
Arsenic in small systems and private wells is usually treated by reverse osmosis. There also are systems that use higher-tech solutions: absorptive media beds and anion exchange resins.
"Usually, for a private well, we suggest that only the water actually consumed be treated, as this reduces the cost and maintenance required, and also limits the amount of water wasted in treatment," Tolman said.
Smith, the state toxicologist, said L.D. 1775, a bill to mandate water testing during housing transactions, failed in 2007.
"The Maine Realtor Association and we opposed it," Smith said. "We made it clear that we supported the intent, but the problem was that they attached other things to the bill that we didn't have the resources to do. So that killed it."
He said the Maine Association of Realtors had issues with being placed in a position to ensure water testing occurs.
"They have been very helpful in getting both arsenic testing and radon testing listed on the standard purchase-and-sale agreement, so it is obvious to most buyers that this should be done," he said. "But focusing on housing transactions or new well construction is at best a very limited way to promote well water testing."
Linda Gifford, chief lobbyist for the Maine Association of Realtors, said her members pass out buyer education booklets with information about arsenic, and there is a box to check off in the purchase-and-sale agreement asking buyers if they want the well water tested for arsenic.
"So arsenic is well covered out there in the real estate market," Gifford said. "To require a seller (to test) -- who many of the times these days is in foreclosure or distressed, or may even be a bank -- it made no sense."
Slow progress
Public health advocates say voluntary education programs are working -- but slowly.
In 2004, Smith said only about 26 percent of Maine households reported knowing whether their wells had been tested for arsenic.
By 2009, he said, that number increased to more than 40 percent.
"We have another survey running now," he said. "So, we are making progress, though not as fast as would like."
Meanwhile, preventing exposure to arsenic in the first place seems like an unlikely solution for Mainers.
Marvinney said it is impossible to predict the frequency of arsenic from fractures in the bedrock prior to drilling.
"One cannot pre-identify a fracture to avoid while drilling," Marvinney said. "There is no way to allow the water into the borehole and exclude the arsenic, uranium or radon in the water."
As for Loiselle, he installed a resin removal system under his kitchen sink.
The metal cylinder is filled with plastic beads coated in iron oxide, which he said draws arsenic out of his drinking water supply. The system treats all cold water from the tap.
"What's nice about this is, the manufacturer sends me a test kit every six months," he said. "They analyze the water and keeps track of the how efficient the removal system is working."

PORTLAND -- A Japanese delegation from the Aomori Prefecture will make a five-day visit to Portland, Augusta and four other communities next week to exchange ideas on alternative energy, business and aquaculture.
The delegation includes government officials, business leaders and university faculty members from a Japanese energy think tank.
The visit, from Sept. 6-10, will include stops at the Gulf of Maine Research Center in Portland, as well as presentations at the Maine International Trade Center, the University of Maine's Offshore Wind Laboratory, the Maine Aquaculture Association and the Maine Shellfish Growers.
The visit was organized by the Maine-Aomori Sister State Advisory Council.
"(The council's) mission is to identify and assess existing activities and exchanges with Aomori and devise strategies to develop cultural, educational and commercial opportunities between the sister states," said Stephen MacDougall, the council's chairman, in a press release.
"This visit, with its very timely focus on energy and the fishery and food products industries, will strengthen and expand the Maine-Aomori partnership and quite possibly reveal the potential for joint research and development programs."
Maine's relationship with the Aomori Prefecture dates to 1889, when the 1,500-ton ship Cheseborough, sailing from Bath, wrecked off the coast of Aomori. Residents from the village of Shariki rescued four survivors and buried the people who died.
That included Peter Erickson, the captain.
Amid the wreckage that drifted ashore, the people of Shariki discovered Maine pears, and enjoyed them so much that they planted pear trees of their own. Every year, the people of Shariki hold a service for the sailors who lost their lives on that night in 1889 and leave pears on the graves of those who died.

Full text: Correspondent
PHIPPSBURG -- The Army Corps of Engineers finished dredging a portion of the Kennebec River on Aug. 14, in time for the Navy to receive Bath Iron Works' newly built destroyer, the DDG 111 Spruance.
But some residents are concerned about the project's impact on marine life.
While the disturbance of silt caused some immediate problems for local fishermen and clammers, long-term effects are uncertain.
Laura Sewall, director of Bates Morse Mountain conservation area and a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Corps, said she saw an unusual spread of dead quahogs washed ashore in the days immediately after the project's completion.
"It was like a trap door had opened up," she said, describing what she said were hundreds of dead quahog shells scattered across the beach Tuesday. "It was like pulses of dead quahogs. It was so visible. People have said we have seen this before, but it was always after a big storm."
But with each passing day, the shells were picked clean by birds and the waves spread them farther apart.
Phippsburg Shellfish Committee chairman Dean Doyle describes the silt washing ashore as a fine, light brown substance.
The Shellfish Committee joined the town of Phippsburg, the Shellfish Conservation Commission, the Phippsburg Land Trust, the Kennebec Estuary Land Trust, Friends of Merrymeeting Bay, residents and others in a legal appeal of a Maine Department of Environmental Protection decision that allowed the out-of-season dredging to occur.
The Corps dredged approximately 70,000 cubic yards of sand near the area of Doubling Point and at the mouth of the Kennebec near Popham Beach.
They dumped the sand in two sites: One just north of Bluff Head, in a portion of the Kennebec known as the Narrows; the other at a spot about a half mile south of Jackknife Ledge.
In their complaint filed with the First District Court in Portland, plaintiffs asked that the court direct the Corps to dredge and dump the river-bottom material using the least environmentally damaging alternative. The complaint included a request to wait to do advanced dredging until off season, or else dredging the minimal amount needed for safe passage of the Spruance down the Kennebec.
Was it enough?
John Libby, a small-business owner and shellfish harvester who sells seafood and produce from his Phippsburg home, is upset by the dredging and thinks it may need to occur again.
"I'm sick and tired about hearing them dumping all the dredging material into a 125-foot hole in the Kennebec, but when they come back five years later, it's still 125 feet deep," Libby said. "It tells you, you need to take that sand out into the ocean and dump it. Yes, it's going to cost more initially, but it's going to save money in the long run. It's just ridiculous."
Ed O'Donnell, navigation chief for the Army Corps of Engineers New England District, said he did not think tidal currents would fill in where they dredged.
Still, he said a lot of material had moved from where they had surveyed from May this year to a pre-dredge survey in late July.
"This river is really unpredictable," he said. "Things changed pretty quickly."
O'Donnell said upriver activity meant they felt they needed to do advanced maintenance dredging, which is additional dredging of sand.
He said that was more cost effective, since getting the equipment onto the river is expensive and they were able to get more done over the course of one project.
He said the Corps didn't take any extraordinary measures to minimize the impact, but that the dredging ship had an endangered species observer on board.
"We didn't see any takes of endangered species," O'Donnell said.
Dave Percy, a lobsterman who sets and hauls his traps by Jackknife Ledge, said he hadn't seen any takes, either. But he said he was surprised to see the dredging ship dump all the material in few spots.
"They just dropped it, boatloads," he said as he unpacked crates of lobsters from the back of his pickup on a West Point dock last week. "I was thinking they'd shoot it out little by little."
Percy said he could not say for sure whether smaller lobsters were affected by the sand dumping.
"I highly doubt they (the lobsters) could get out of the way," he said. "That's why everybody wanted them (Army Corps) to go further out (to dump)."
In addition to the concern about dumping in what many have described as a prime lobster fishery, there's some concern over how the dredging will affect clam flats.
Doyle said he has taken water samples and conducted tests for fecal pollution at 20 clam flat sites along the Kennebec River -- from Fort Popham to the South End Launch in Bath, during and after the dredging.
"There was a lot of stuff stirred up," he said, without elaborating.
Dot Kelly, a member of the Phippsburg Land Trust, stuck rods in the flats at low tide before the dredging began, to mark, in 10-centimeter intervals, any accumulation of silt.
She said the rods did not show how much silt had accumulated on the flats, and that it is difficult for citizen scientists to quickly determine the potential damage an August dredging project would have on marine life.
"It's not something that happens overnight," she said.
But she questioned the timing. "The Army Corps of Engineers even said August is the worst month for this."
"Is it really going to extend to the next time they need to dredge?" she said. "When the river needs to be dredged again, we need to be collaborative."
Kelly was referring to the hope that many residents, shellfish harvesters, lobstermen, business owners and town officials have for open communication between the Navy, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies to get the necessary work accomplished with the least negative impact.
Several days after the project, clam diggers began seeing signs of clams, but many said they were not sure if the lack of holes immediately following the dredging were from the warm August weather or from the disturbance from the dredging process.
Affect on clams
August is high season for fishing and tourism on the Maine coast, when clam diggers make $130 per bushel, the highest price paid for clams all year.
A significant concern among residents is an accumulation of dredging silt on the spat, the baby clams harvesters planted in spring. Throughout the summer, the spat float freely in the water and then toward summer's end, they settle into the mud.
Local clam harvester Terry Watson said he remembers a test that was taken several years ago, during the time of another Kennebec River dredging project, which sought to measure the accumulation of silt on the clam flats. He alleged that after the project, harvesters lost two years' worth of clams as a result of smothering sediment.
Watson said he did not see significant layering of sediment this year.
While some residents argue the effects of the dredging are not as easy to see, any sediment of sand dumped from the dredging process on the flats could suffocate the clam spat.
Clam spat is tiny, smaller in circumference than a fingernail, with necks that can't stretch beyond half of an inch. Larger clams are found deeper in the mud, since they have longer necks that can reach the surface.
"I wouldn't be able to say whether (the dredging) affected the seed," Doyle said. "It takes two to three years for them to mature."
Doyle said his father still works at Bath Iron Works, as do many members of his family.
As one of several plaintiffs against the Army Corps of Engineers, Doyle emphasized one point he said he has stressed all along: They weren't interested in stopping the ship's passage down the Kennebec, but were asking for the least amount of damage be done to the river.
"There's more in the Kennebec than that shipyard," Doyle said. "It would be better if they would just work with the fishermen. There are plenty of other ways to do it.
"We don't want to see (BIW) be impacted at all," he said. "But it would be nice if we could sit down and work on something that could work out for everybody."

Full text: The Portland Press Herald
Legislation to allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to dredge the Kennebec River and dump the materials offshore near Popham Beach has been signed into law.
Gov. Paul LePage signed the emergency legislation, L.D. 1398, on Friday after it was approved by the House and the Senate. The law, which took effect immediately, means that dredging can be done in early August, during the height of the tourist season and commercial fishing along the Kennebec.
The Corps says the river's navigation channel must be dredged to allow the Navy destroyer USS Spruance to leave Bath Iron Works safely, where it is undergoing final revisions. The Navy has said speedy delivery of the ship is critical to national defense. The ship is scheduled to leave BIW on Sept. 1.
Adrienne Bennett, the governor's spokeswoman, said the bill was reviewed thoroughly by the Legislature's Environment and Natural Resources Committee, and the House and the Senate, which passed it without debate.
The Environment and Natural Resources Committee voted 12-1 to recommend passage.
"There was real concern among legislators about the impact on fishing, but those concerns did not outweigh the necessity for the Navy to get its destroyer out of Bath safely," said Rep. Robert Duchesne, D-Old Town, the committee's ranking Democrat.
The dredging project probably will begin Aug. 1 unless an appeal filed by the town of Phippsburg, its commercial clam harvesters, the Phippsburg Land Trust, the Kennebec Estuary Land Trust and the Friends of Merrymeeting Bay is upheld by the state Board of Environmental Protection.
Proponents say the legislation makes a long-overdue correction to state water quality standards. The river's water quality classification, before Friday, would not have permitted dredging.
"From the department's perspective, we feel that our own historical records support that this portion of the Kennebec was originally supposed to be cleared for dredging," said Samantha DePoy-Warren, spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection.
Opponents say the dredging should have been done last winter, not in August, when boating, recreational and commercial fishing, and clam digging reach their peak in Phippsburg.
Steve Hinchman, an attorney in West Bath who represents Phippsburg's interests, said the disposal site will be less than a half-mile from the shore of Popham Beach.
"The disposal site will be peppered with lobster traps in August. It's going to become ground zero for the dredging project," Hinchman said.
He said the project has the potential to devastate commercial fishing and clamming along the Kennebec River in Phippsburg, and to disrupt tourist activities such as boating and fishing.
"In 22 years, the state has never issued a permit to dredge the Kennebec River in the summer months," Hinchman said. "It's a 180-degree reversal of the position taken by every other governor (before LePage)."
Shellfish harvesters are concerned that dredged materials will settle on clam flats, making it difficult for them to dig. It could also kill juvenile clams, they say.
Duchesne, the state legislator, said Hinchman could not provide scientific evidence that would justify his concerns. He said the state Department of Marine Resources has agreed to monitor the project.
In April, the DEP issued a permit to the Corps to allow it to dredge the Kennebec River in August.
About a month later, Hinchman filed an appeal with the state. DePoy-Warren said the appeal could be heard in July by the Board of Environmental Protection.
She said Hinchman's pending appeal doesn't stay the permit issued by the DEP.

Full text: Two local farmers trying method on Scarborough River
BY ANN S. KIM
The Portland Press Herald
SCARBOROUGH -- Standing on his pontoon work station, Nate Perry scooped young inch-and-a-half-long oysters into plastic mesh bags. Good weather meant an opportunity to deploy some floating bags and get the shellfish on the way to market size.
By this time of year, nearly all the bags have been set out. The warm waters of the Scarborough River will encourage the oysters to pump and take in nutrients after their winter hibernation. When they reach cocktail size -- 3 inches -- Perry, a one-man operation, will be able to harvest them and sell them to markets and restaurants hungry for Maine oysters.
Perry and Abigail Carroll, another fledgling farmer, are among the first to try oyster aquaculture in the Scarborough River. The location, with its tidal currents and particular nutrients, creates oysters that they try to describe with such adjectives as briny, sweet, creamy and grassy.
"That's what an oyster is, it's the taste of the sea where it came from," Perry said.
While Carroll sees continued high demand for Maine oysters, she cautions that oyster aquaculture isn't for everyone. The work, she notes, is dirty, hard and very physical.
Carroll and Perry each use bags with foam floats that are connected to lines. The systems vary in the details, and Carroll and her two part-time employees do some of their work on the beach at low tide rather than on a pontoon like Perry does. But each of them will have to flip the bags regularly to dry out the algae that forms on the wet side and root out invaders like starfish and crabs. As the oysters grow, the farmers have to sort them into different bags to provide them more room.
"You've got to really nurture these guys," Carroll said.
It takes about three years to grow oyster seeds -- specks about 2 millimeters big -- to market size. Carroll got a jumpstart with her initial batch by starting with juveniles.
Perry and Carroll each are looking to expand small operations around Nonesuch Point after an initial go under small-scale licenses that limit operations to 400 square feet. Under the new licenses they're seeking, Perry could expand to 1.4 acres and Carroll to 4 acres.
A third license holder, Ernest Heether, began a venture with Carroll before they went their separate ways. Heether, who could not be reached, has renewed his small-scale license with the state.
The expansions planned by Perry and Carroll come at time when aquaculture is becoming the new face of the working waterfront in Maine, said Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association. The sector is growing as it becomes more difficult to make a living in traditional fishing, whether due to limits on the resources or a lack of available licenses, he said.
Perry, who comes from a lobstering family, also makes his living by teaching music and working at J's Oyster in Portland. (His shucking skills -- he's done about 1,000 in an hour -- once won him a state title.) Carroll is an entrepreneur who got immersed in oyster aquaculture after deciding to investigate the concept and work on a business plan.
Oyster aquaculture in Maine is centered around the Damariscotta River, where research at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center in Walpole and warm water created a hospitable environment. More than 72 percent of last year's harvest -- some 2.96 million oysters -- were from the Damariscotta River.
Interest in oyster aquaculture had been increasing slowly and steadily, said Jon Lewis, aquaculture environmental coordinator at the state Department of Marine Resources. There are about 150 oyster sites in the state, with some businesses operating multiple sites.
In addition to proper temperatures, oysters need areas that are free from fecal coliform contamination. Other considerations include navigation, water flow and other uses of the area.
Both Perry and Carroll are growing American, or Eastern, oysters, which account for nearly all the oysters from Maine. Wellfleets, Blue Points and Pemaquids are all American oysters that come from different locations.
Perry expects to sell his oysters under the name Pine Point Oyster Co. in time for Independence Day, and Carroll has been selling hers as Nonesuch Oysters.
He hopes to sell about 1,000 a week while she hopes to increase production from hundreds a week to thousands.
As a side project, Carroll is also growing Belons, or European flats, the other type of oyster found in Maine. Distinctive in their metallic undertones, Belons are prized in their homeland of France and among connoisseurs. They are also more difficult to grow. Carroll is growing them as part of a research project coordinated by the Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research and Education.
Oysters are a high-value product, with Americans able to fetch 50 or 60 cents apiece on the wholesale market, according to Lewis. That market was worth more than $1.75 million last year.
The strength of Maine's brand is based not just on the state's reputation as a pristine area. There's a biological basis as well, Belle noted.
Water temperatures in Maine are relatively cold, which means that oysters here generally do not spawn. When oysters direct their energies toward reproduction, their glycogen content falls, making them less sweet and plump, Belle said.
Maine oyster farmers cannot grow enough to satisfy demand and it's not uncommon for growers to have to ration the number they provide to each account, Belle said.
"There aren't enough Maine oysters for the world," Carroll said.

Full text: This version of "Pirates of the Caribbean -- On Stranger Tides," long awaited by some, is finally here, and presented under the baton of "Chicago's" Rob Marshall. This accounts for a good deal. All of the sword fights are choreographed with some threatening to offer a kick line. There are times, as well, when it appears that our players are about to break into song. "Come sail with me, come sail away with me."
In this, the latest dragged-out chapter (no pun intended) of "Pirates of the Caribbean," the beaches are awash in comic opera-neo-Shakespearian androgyny. One almost needs a photo menu to tell who is what. We get dueling sword-swashers here with Jack Sparrow (Mr. Depp) and his paramour Angelica (Ms. Cruz) swinging various swords and bon mots.
Jack (Johnny Depp, of course) and Angelica (miscast Penelope Cruz) still maintain their love-you-hate-you schtick, but at deck level, and even from the poop-deck, it's a glaringly obvious fact that Sparrow secretly longs to be Angelica, and Angelica wants to be Sparrow. Go see it again and tell me I'm wrong. Both spend their moments together flashing evening shadow-lined eyes at one another when they're not trying to avoid killing one another. Angelica keeps eyeing Jack's bandanna, beads, eye shadow and assorted bling, while sashaying around in an oversized man-hat. Interesting touch.
In this version, where Depp never strays from his signature schtick, we do get better supporting players. Ian McShane is aboard as Angelica's papa Blackbeard, now flourished with touches of gray. Ian does what Ian is good at -- snarling at the bottom of his lungs and flashing death-ray eyes. We love Ian, but like almost everyone in this water-logged float-a-rama, he is wasted.
Also wasting his time, and like the others, simply on board for the paycheck, is the fabulous Oscar-ite Geoffrey Rush, returning as Captain Barbossa, he of the oyster shell skin and ropey beard.
This entire expensive crew is signed up here to set sail to a mysterious Caribbean island in search of Ponce de Leon's storied "Fountain of Youth," never mind that the mythical fountain was set in Florida. They will fight swells, both oceanic and royal, to put themselves in harm's way just to get a swig of de Leon's super-juice. All the above come with a back up cast of zombies, monkeys, perverted swabbies, and inept deckhands.
The movie opens up in London, where Sparrow is disguised as a royal jurist, in order to free an old shipmate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) whom the royal cops think is Sparrow. Say what? McNally couldn't look more butch or more like a bouncer in a pirate's strip bar. They escape only to be re-caught and brought before a pompous British Lord, at a massive dining table. It's clearly an homage to the big banquet scene in Errol Flynn's great "Robin Hood." In fact, much of the action, fencing, lancing, swinging from trees and parapets, is all lifted from Warner Brother's great pirate films. Sadly, they're all done in darkened sepia tones, deep shadows and candlelight, clearly designed to disguise the fact that Depp is no Errol Flynn.
The biggest surprise in this version is a real eye opener and original. The crews are coming ashore in long boats when they are surprised by a bevy of mermaids. That's right, mermaids. But these are not cute little Disney mermaids. This bunch of tailed femmes are right out of "Jaws." They lure the guys with song and sex and then ... Well, I'll not reveal the fun.
One mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) is netted and brought along as a love interest for a young traveling preacher (San Clafin.) He gives her a name, Syrena. She is fresh, lovely and pensive, puffy lipped and doe-eyed, all of which makes poor Cruz look like Katy Jurado in comparison. Which reminds us to add that Salma Hayek would have been a better choice of Anjelica. Cruz, at least in this role, lacks the Hispanic fire and steam required of Blackbeard's daughter.
"Pirates" is clearly for many, lots of fun, a real popcorn bacchanal. Like miniature golf, it helps to be 10 to 12, but for adults looking to opt out of the endless cutesy "Hangover" flicks, it's welcome relief. OMG Is that Judy Dench in the carriage and Keith Richards in the pirate bar? Is he really Jack Sparrow's father? I hastily add that mermaids are harmed in this film, but they're only computerized, and that Julia Roberts does not make a cameo appearance.
J.P. Devine is a former stage and screen actor.

Summer dredging plan for Kennebec a concern

Full text: Maine Sunday Telegram
Popham Beach area fishermen, business owners and others are trying to block the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from dredging the Kennebec River during the height of the summer fishing and tourism season.
While dredging is normally done in winter, the corps is seeking state and federal permits to remove 70,000 cubic yards of silt from two sections of the river in August. The dredge spoils would be deposited downriver in Phippsburg, and offshore near Seguin Island off Popham Beach.
The corps, which is responsible for keeping federal navigation channels open, says the work is necessary to prevent the U.S.S. Spruance, a $1 billion destroyer under construction at Bath Iron Works, from running aground when it leaves in September.
The Navy says speedy delivery of the 510-foot ship is critical to national defense. Opponents say they are seeking a compromise that won't harm the endangered short-nosed sturgeon, Atlantic salmon and other wildlife in the river, or jeopardize the livelihoods of clammers, lobstermen and those involved in the tourist trade.
"They are wiping out the entire bottom habitat, smothering it under a layer of sand. Ecologically, dredging is carpet bombing," said Stephen Hinchman, a West Bath lawyer.
Hinchman represents the town of Phippsburg, the Phippsburg Shellfish Conservation Commission's 40 commercial harvesters, the Phippsburg Land Trust, the Kennebec Estuary Land Trust, Friends of Merrymeeting Bay and several Phippsburg residents who have appealed a conditional permit issued by former state Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Darryl Brown. The appeal is one of four filed in the case.
They will be decided by the Board of Environmental Protection.
Brown issued the permit earlier this year, on the condition that the Legislature reclassify the water quality in sections of the river below BIW where the dredged material will be dumped. The current classification, the highest possible, prohibits the disposal of dredged material.
DEP officials said the sections in question were mistakenly classified at the highest level in the 1990s.
"Our documentation makes it clear to us there was an error," said Susan Davies, water quality standards coordinator at the DEP.
Lawmakers have yet to act on the reclassification, which is included in an omnibus bill proposing changes to DEP rules.
Opponents say they are not against shipbuilding or dredging, but they question why the corps didn't plan better for the project.
"It is frustrating for us because we know they have to do it, and BIW provides a ton of jobs for our families and friends. But why do we have to do all the sucking it up for poor planning?" said Ethan DeBery, a Phippsburg resident who runs a fishing excursion boat and ferry boat to Seguin Island.
Opponents say they are just asking the corps to take less intrusive steps than the full-fledged dredge the agency is proposing -- the firstsince 2003 -- to ensure that the Spruance doesn't run aground.
Hinchman said it is possible the channel can be deepened by using a mechanical bucket dredge rather than the proposed hopper dredge, which vacuums up the material. He said the corps could then come back and do the full dredging in the winter.
Bill Kavanaugh, manager of the dredging project, said the corps cannot afford to dredge twice. He said federal funding for maintenance dredging is declining, especially for projects like this one, that do not involve commercially important ports. The Kennebec dredging will cost about $1.5 million.
"We are not looking to modify our plan," said Kavanaugh.
He disputed opponents' claims that the dredging would hurt fishing or the environment, saying the corps is required to pursue the least costly environmentally suitable alternative available.
"We don't anticipate any flats being closed and any significant impacts as far as fishing and tourism," said Kavanaugh.
He said ongoing dredging off Cape Cod in Massachusetts has benefitted fishing.
"You are dredging up sediments that contain tiny organisms that fish go for," said Kavanaugh.
He said he expects the project to win approval from the National Marine Fisheries Service, which has the authority to stop the work if it threatens endangered species.
Opponents point out that the destroyer went safely down the river for sea trials in March, when a Bath Iron Works pilot successfully navigated the ship outside the designated channel.
But Commander Tate Westbrook, a self-described environmentalist and captain of the Spruance and its 275 crew members, said that is a risk he cannot take. He said that in March, with the tides at their highest, the ship barely cleared the bottom.
"We had two feet between the bottom of my ship and the granite edges of the river," said Westbrook.
He said no matter how experienced the pilot, it is impossible to know exactly where the channel is under a destroyer, which is not equipped with a forward depth sounder.
Westbrook said the safety of his crew, many of whom will be going to sea for the first time, is at stake as well as the environment if his ship runs aground and spills the 300,000 gallons of fuel it will be carrying.
Westbrook said due to technical delays the ship is already six months overdue for its nearly year-long trip down the East Coast and through the Panama Canal to its home port of San Diego. Westbrook said the chief of naval operations, Admiral Gary Roughead, has repeatedly told Congress the Navy needs 313 destroyers to meet its current obligations around the world, but is operating with an active fleet of only 286.
"In Navy-speak, the demand for destroyers exceeds the supply," said Westbrook.
Last week, the corps conducted new channel surveys to determine whether spring runoff may have solved the problem by washing out the sand blocking the channel. Although the results are not yet available, Kavanaugh expressed doubt because the snowpack in the Kennebec watershed over the winter was below normal.
Even if the channel has opened up, there is no guarantee it will remain so this summer, when sand at the mouth of the river washes back toward shore and up the river, said Kavanaugh.
Bath Iron Works officials find themselves caught in the middle.
"BIW has no desire to negatively impact the livelihoods of either our Phippsburg neighbors, the 111 BIW employees who reside in Phippsburg or the 5,600 BIW employees who live in communities across the state and make their living building ships for the U.S. Navy," said spokesman Jim DeMartini.
But BIW officials questioned the motives of some of the opponents, such as landowner Dot Kelly, who has applied for a federal permit to place six tidal turbines in the area where the dredge spoils will go.
Kelly said her concerns are strictly about the environmental impact of the project.
"I just want them to go through the legal process for permits," said Kelly.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree has met with both Bath Iron Works and the dredging opponents to try to broker a compromise. She said she is concerned about the effects of an August dredge.
"I hope it won't be necessary," said Pingree.
Meanwhile, time is running out, Kavanaugh said.
It is unclear when the Board of Environmental Protection will get to the appeals, including two filed by area residents opposed to the dredging and one by the corps, which is seeking an unconditional permit that would require no legislative action.
The BEP has stopped meeting until its members are vetted for possible conflicts of interest, at the direction of Gov. Paul LePage. The governor instituted the review following the resignation of Brown, the former DEP commissioner, over conflict-of-interest concerns.
Brown resigned after it became apparent that his ownership of an environmental consulting firm could violate conflict-of-interest provisions in state and federal law, making him ineligible for the job.
Hinchman, the lawyer representing dredging critics, played a key role in raising the conflict-of-interest issue with the federal government, state lawmakers and the Maine Attorney General's Office.
Opponents say that even if the Legislature reclassifies water quality in the Kennebec, dredging in the summer still violates standards, and they will continue to fight it.
"You can't ask the people who live and work on the water to be the ones to pay for it. They should have done it last winter," said Hinchman.

AUGUSTA -- Nearly three years after a couple of Portland chefs got sick from eating poisonous mushrooms, Maine lawmakers may adopt the nation's most extensive food safety regulations for wild fungi.
Legislators are considering a bill to require that at least one person who is trained and certified to identify edible wild mushrooms handle the delicacies before they are sold at markets or served in restaurants.
"Many of the mushroom varieties look the same but are quite different when it comes to being safe to eat," said Sen. Brian Langley, R-Ellsworth, who is the bill's sponsor and a restaurant owner. "It would be a product we'd love to sell. But the way it stands now, I can't bear that risk."
The Legislature's Joint Standing Committee on Health and Human Services Committee took up Langley's bill during a work session Monday and voted 10-0 that it ought to pass. The bill now goes to the Senate for ratification.
Maine has a relatively small wild mushroom industry with an estimated 200 commercial foragers who sell to a dealer or directly to markets or restaurant chefs.
Now, with the industry enjoying a growing interest in local, organic and wild foods, it also must satisfy public expectations that the food sold in markets or restaurants is regulated and safe to eat.
"Maine has over 2,000 mushroom species. Of those, about 10 are common and potentially deadly," said Greg Marley, a Rockland-based author and mushroom expert who helped draft the bill. Some varieties that can cause severe intestinal distress or liver toxicity look a lot like edible ones at different stages of growth, he said.
Nationwide, poisonous mushrooms kill three or four people a year, according to the Northern New England Poison Center. No deaths have been reported in Maine in recent years, although Mainers are sickened each year when they pick and eat toxic mushrooms.
The bill before Maine's Legislature -- L.D. 1407 -- is a direct response to a pair of poisonings in the summer of 2008, when a commercial forager sold misidentified mushrooms to a couple of Portland restaurants.
Two chefs ate the mushrooms a few weeks apart and became so ill and dehydrated they had to be hospitalized. No restaurant patrons were served the mushrooms, which turned out to be poisonous lilac brown boletes instead of edible king boletes, or porcinis, officials said.
"When it happened twice, we started to become really concerned," said Dr. Karen Simone, head of the Northern New England Poison Center. "That was very unusual. ... It concerned me that restaurants were involved."
Had the mushrooms been served to an elderly or ill patron, it could have been life-threatening, she said. "These were two young, healthy people, and they got so sick that one guy needed the same treatment as a chemotherapy patient" for vomiting and dehydration.
Health officials would not identify the chefs or the restaurants involved.
The Maine CDC traced the mushrooms back to a forager, but officials could only pass the man's name to the Maine Restaurant Association so it could warn members.
"We followed up with the establishments, but don't have any regulatory authority over the person who foraged them," said Lisa Brown, health inspection program manager for the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
The unusual cases involving commercially harvested mushrooms led to the creation of a state task force that included foragers, chefs, the Maine Restaurant Association, health officials and mycologists, or people who study fungi.
The task force came up with the proposal to require training and certification. If it passes, wild mushrooms could be sold to the public only if they are handled by someone ? a forager, dealer or chef ? who is trained and certified every five years to identify edible and poisonous mushrooms.
Individuals could be certified for as many as 35 different edible mushrooms depending on the level of training they seek, Brown said.
The Maine Mycological Association, a nonprofit group of mushroom aficionados, would coordinate the training and testing, which would cost an estimated $75, according to Brown.
While some states have patchwork rules, Maine would be the first to have a comprehensive training requirement, said Brown, who also is working with officials in other states toward a possible national standard.
"No one has this type of program that we're drafting. All states are struggling with this," Brown said.
Brown called Maine's proposal a compromise to ensure public safety without placing too much burden on traditional foragers, many of whom pick mushrooms as part of a subsistence livelihood in parts of the state with few other job opportunities.
Under the bill, individual foragers would not have to be certified as long as they sell to a dealer or chef who is certified.
"We don't want to destroy people's livelihood. We want to make sure it stays alive and healthy. But we also want to protect public health," Brown said.
State officials have said the state could be forced to outlaw the sale of Maine-harvested wild mushrooms if there is no training standard to guarantee public safety.
Some in the industry, however, see the regulation effort as an overreaction.
"We don't need to be completely overburdened by more bureaucracy," said Rick Tibbets, a forager and mushroom grower in Scarborough.
Tibbets said he has been picking and selling wild mushrooms for 40 years and doesn't need to be tested by amateur mycologists. He proposed that the state simply register foragers and require proof of insurance. "What they would do is get rid of all the riff-raff," he said.
Dan Heydon is an owner of Oyster Creek Mushroom in Damariscotta. Along with cultivating mushrooms, the company buys wild varieties from as many as 100 foragers and sells to health food stores, markets and restaurants.
Although the proposed law could encourage foragers to sell to Heydon rather than get their own training and certification, he called the bill an overreaction, especially in a state with such a small industry.
"It looks like we'd probably be the heaviest-regulated state. I just don't understand it," he said. "I just think that we as a state have too many other things we have to worry about other than a handful of people selling a handful of mushrooms."
Sam Hayward, chef at Fore Street in Portland, said he feared the poisonings in 2008 would lead to an overreaction. But, he said, the proposal appears to be reasonable.
"It's the responsible thing that we be educated," he said. "I'm going to reserve judgment until I have a chance to really read the regulations and rules."
Hayward, who has picked his own wild mushrooms and cooked with them for decades, said he buys only from the most reliable pickers. Knowing how to tell good and bad mushrooms apart has been valuable.
The same summer that two other Portland chefs ate bad mushrooms, a different forager Hayward did not know dropped off some wild mushrooms at Fore Street for Hayward to use.
When he saw the mushrooms, he immediately recognized them as a poisonous variety and told the forager to come back and take them away, he said.
"They could have made someone ill."

State House Bureau
AUGUSTA -- State lawmakers must find $120,000 to maintain funding for three scientists who inspect shellfish beds, which are critical to Maine's $20 million-a-year shellfish industry, Sen. Lois Snowe-Mello, R-Poland, said Tuesday.
"These three positions must be maintained in order to ensure public health and safety, ensure uninterrupted services to the shellfish industry, and protect the Maine shellfish brand and economy," said Snowe-Mello, Senate chairwoman of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee.
Snowe-Mello and other members of the committee told the Appropriations Committee that they agree unanimously with Gov. Paul LePage's proposed marine resources budget, except for the omission of funding for the scientists.
The legislators recommended -- by unanimous, bipartisan vote -- adding money for the positions to the two-year budget that would take effect July 1.
Rep. Patrick Flood, R-Winthrop, House chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said he wants to check with the LePage administration to see "what the wishes are of the governor."
"I don't want to be terribly critical of the executive branch," he said. "A lot of things fall through the cracks, and this may be one of them."
Adrienne Bennett, spokeswoman for LePage, said Tuesday evening that the administration is working with the committee to find a solution.
The Legislature created the positions in 2009, after the state closed shellfish beds from Kittery to Harpswell in response to a determination by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that "Maine was not in compliance with federal requirements," said the Marine Resources Committee's report.
Snowe-Mello and other committee members said the state's shellfish industry must stay in compliance with federal rules so clammers can sell shellfish across state lines. Clammers have been a visible presence at the State House since last week as they have discussed the issue with lawmakers.
"A dirty lobster or a bad clam, and we lose billions of dollars," said Sen. Nancy Sullivan, D-Biddeford. "This needs to work, and we have to play ball with the feds."
Lawmakers funded the positions through fees for subsurface wastewater disposal systems, fees paid by public sewage treatment plants, and overboard discharge surcharges.
Those sources haven't produced enough money to support the positions over the long term, said Patrick Keliher, acting deputy commissioner for the Department of Marine Resources. He said funding for the positions will run out in June 2012. The additional $120,000 requested would keep the positions funded through 2016, he said.
Commissioner Darryl Brown of the Department of Environmental Protection said he will examine his budget to look for funding. He said the state should add to the number of people who inspect the shellfish beds.
"These positions are what we need to keep, to maintain a minimum level of performance," he said.

Full text: MSX showed up here for the first last summer
Maine Sunday Telegram
WALPOLE -- This time of year, Damariscotta River oyster growers usually kick back and relax.
The river is covered with a thick crust of snow and ice and the oyster beds underneath lie dormant.
But this year, many are finding it hard to take it easy. A disease that decimated the Chesapeake Bay oyster fishery showed up for the first time last summer in the Damariscotta, the site of Maine's most productive oyster beds.
Now the river's 24 leaseholders are wondering what damage the disease, known as MSX, has done over the winter.
"Historically, when MSX has been found, it tends to persist," said Chris Davis, co-owner of Pemaquid Oyster Co. and director of the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center.
The disease, which is spread by Haplosporidium nelsoni, a single-celled parasite, is harmless to humans but deadly to the American oysters cultivated in the Damariscotta.
The disease was first detected in the United States in Delaware Bay in 1957 and is believed to have arrived from oysters introduced from the Pacific Ocean. Two years later, it showed up in lower Chesapeake Bay, where it quickly spread to 90 percent of the oysters.
It was always thought that Maine waters were too cold for the parasite to take hold - until last July. That's when dead oysters began to show up in the holding rafts, where they are stored for a couple of weeks of de-silting after being harvested from their muddy beds farther up the river.
By mid-August, the growers sent their oysters off for testing and got the bad news that MSX had moved into the river, the state's breadbasket when it comes to oyster farming.
The river is perfectly suited to oysters, said Marcy Nelson, a scientist at the Department of Marine Resources.
Great Salt Bay, which lies at the head of the river north of the U.S. Route 1 bridge at Damariscotta and Newcastle, provides a rich source of phytoplankton, on which oysters feed. The water in the upper river is warm, so the oysters grow plumper more quickly than in other Maine rivers.
American oysters raised on the Damariscotta account for 63 percent of the state's annual cultivated harvest, which has fluctuated between 1.6 million and 3.6 million pieces annually, worth an estimated $3 million to $5 million to the growers.
A Damariscotta oyster can fetch up to $5 on the half-shell at the toniest raw bars in Los Angeles and other big cities, said James King, in sales and marketing at JP Shellfish in Eliot.
"These are premier oysters," he said.
Oyster farming on the Damariscotta grew out of research being done at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center in Walpole 30 years ago, when the bivalve had disappeared from the river for unknown reasons; but the towering shell middens left on the shoreline by feasting Indians 2,000 years ago attested to the once-bountiful supply of the mollusks.
Davis, of Pemaquid Oyster, who earned his doctorate at the University of Maine doing oyster research, was among the earliest to start an oyster aquaculture operation on the river in the 1980s.
Today, there is little available space left for lease.
Once the presence of MSX was confirmed, Davis and other growers quickly initiated a quarantine of the oysters with the help of the Department of Marine Resources, to prevent diseased oysters from being moved into other areas and spreading the infection.
No one knows why MSX hit the river last summer, but many blame the previous warm, dry winter followed by a string of record high temperatures and higher salinity levels in the river.
"MSX does not like fresh water," said Nelson.
Just how the parasite spreads remains a mystery.
Researchers at the Department of Marine Resources and the University of Maine Cooperative Extension tested farmed and wild oyster beds in other areas of the state and found the disease in the upper Sheepscot River and upper New Meadows River, but at much lower levels. The strain found in these two rivers also appears to be different from the strain in the Damariscotta River.
Nelson said that leads the researchers to believe that MSX was introduced to the Damariscotta River through human activity, rather than traveling naturally up the coast from the south.
"It is unlikely we will ever know the exact source of the MSX outbreak in the Damariscotta," she said.
There is no cure for the disease, but various strains of American oysters have been developed with higher levels of resistance. Also, there is a local supply of disease-resistant oyster seed at Mook Sea Farm in Walpole.
Ironically, the hatchery turns out 50 million MSX-resistant oyster seeds annually for other parts of the country that have been hard hit by MSX. Because it was assumed that Maine waters were immune, however, the disease-resistant strains were not being used locally, not even by Bill Mook, hatchery owner.
Mook, whose Wiley Point oyster farm harvests 400,000 to 500,000 oysters a year, said he lost several hundred thousand dollars last season to MSX.
"We took a big hit," Mook said.
This year, Mook is cranking up his hatchery production, in part to meet increased demand for the disease-resistant seed. He said the seed growing today at his hatchery will be sown this spring and ready for harvest in 12 to 14 months.
The University of Maine is also working on a disease-resistant strain.
Some of the Damariscotta's farmers say they are waiting until the ice melts, sometime next month, before deciding what course of action to take. It is also possible a very cold winter could reduce the level of MSX infection this summer.
"We are an industry of bright, ambitious people who think outside of the box. If there is any industry in the world, this industry can figure its way around this roadblock," said Barb Scully, owner of Glidden Point Oyster Co. in Edgecomb.

Full text: The Portland Press Herald
This time of year, Maine cities and towns are busily removing towering snowbanks to make roads and sidewalks safe, and trucking the piles to snow dumps.
Under state regulations that protect water quality, the dumps must be away from rivers and streams, partly surrounded by silt barriers and, by June 30, cleared of all the trash that gets left behind when the snow melts.
Now, a bill backed by the Maine Municipal Association would let cities and towns dump their snow wherever they want -- including into lakes, rivers and coastal bays -- without permission from the Department of Environmental Protection.
Municipalities that support the measure say snow dump rules cost them money and create their own environmental problems. But some environmental groups say that abolishing the regulations would threaten water supplies, kill fish and contaminate shellfish beds.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Sheryl Briggs, D-Mexico, has created another battle over environmental regulations in the early days of Gov. Paul LePage's administration. The snow dump requirements are on LePage's list of rules that he wants to abolish or weaken to make the state more friendly to businesses and create jobs.
Briggs said she sponsored the bill to review the regulations, not necessarily to abolish them.
"I am not saying it is a good idea, but I am saying the discussion should come forward," said Briggs, who is executive secretary for the town of Mexico.
Briggs' boss, Town Manager John Madigan, is lobbying for the change. He said the rules cost the town money and don't prevent pollution.
Mexico is one of about 10 municipalities in Maine that pay $315 a year to operate snow dumps that do not conform to DEP regulations.
"The bottom line is, we are along the Androscoggin River, and when the snow melts it is going to get there anyway," said Madigan.
Madigan said the town used to pile the snow it removed from its downtown behind the town hall, which is on the river. Now, it hauls the snow to a dump four or five miles away.
The new dump is licensed by the DEP, but the town has to pay the $315 fee because the site is over an aquifer.
Madigan said that moving the snow dump has created its own problems, driving up the cost of transporting the snow and sending more diesel fumes from dump trucks into the air.
He said the snow dump license fee is just one of a number of fees charged to towns by the state, and those costs add up.
"The state keeps taking money away from us, and all we can do is pass it on to property taxpayers," said Madigan.
He said he is skeptical that snow dumps pollute and questions the research on which the regulations are based.
Environmental groups say there is no question that snow dumps pollute and need regulation.
Joe Payne, baykeeper for the Friends of Casco Bay, said snow is dirty even before it hits the ground because it washes pollutants from the air as it falls. On the ground, it mixes with oil, dirt, road salt, litter and other material on roadways.
"There are plenty of studies that show how polluted snow is. You dump it into the water, and the pollutants go into the mud. It is one thing that is preventable," said Payne.
Geoff Herman, director of state and federal regulations for the Maine Municipal Association, said the bill was backed by the association's 70-member policy committee. He said clearing roads and sidewalks of snow is a public safety issue, not a pollution issue.
Herman said the bill would help cities and towns that don't own property that is suitable for snow dumps under current regulations.
"It has been a real limitation about where they can put the snow," he said.
Stephen Hinchman, lawyer for the Androscoggin River Alliance, said that if the DEP no longer issues snow dumping permits, any dumps that discharge into waters will violate federal law, and expose cities and towns to lawsuits.
Some municipalities say they welcome the snow dump rules because they protect water supplies.
"I don't think the regulations have been onerous at all," said Mike Bolduc, Saco's public works director.
When Saco's snow dump melts in the spring, he said, it leaves behind a pile of debris that would otherwise go into storm drains and, ultimately, the Saco River.
Portland officials said that even if the snow dump regulations are abolished, the city will keep its controls to minimize the dumps' environmental impacts.
The city piled snow in a vacant lot in the Bayside neighborhood until it got full. Truckloads of snow are going now to a site on outer Congress Street.
"We will continue to be good environmental stewards," said Nicole Clegg, the city's spokeswoman.

Full text: I surely hope that the Wiscasset School District can come to some agreement with our Native Americans for a new mascot with a Native American name.
Their idea of a Redskin mascot was surely in respect to their identity with Native Americans.
The oyster shell midden in my opinion in nearby Damariscotta is the most wondrous human creation in the entire state. Many of our locations retain their native American names.

PORTLAND -- The meat industry has its "Beef, It's What's for Dinner" promotion. Pork producers market their product as "the other white meat." Now the U.S. seafood industry is preparing to cast its own marketing net in a bid to reel in more consumers.
More than 50 fishing and seafood organizations from 24 states have signed on to the National Seafood Marketing Coalition, a group that's working on a national plan to better market American seafood and is hoping for help from the federal government. Organizers say promotion, new product development, education and other marketing means will strengthen the U.S. seafood economy and generate jobs.
"Our experience is that a little bit of marketing goes a long way," said Dane Somers, executive director of the Maine Lobster Promotion Council who has been active with the national group. "Since nobody's doing much, when you do a little bit it's noticeable."
Americans eat a lot of seafood; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates they spent about $75.5 billion on fishery products in 2009.
In 2009, they consumed 4.8 billion pounds of fish and shellfish, or 15.8 pounds per person. However, 84 percent of that seafood was imported, up from 68 percent in 2000 and 54 percent in 1995, NOAA says.
But it's not just imports that domestic seafood producers are up against, said Bruce Schactler, a Kodiak, Alaska, fisherman who's serving as the coalition's volunteer director. The industry also competes against other proteins, such as meat, chicken and pork, as well as other foods, he said.
Fishermen and seafood processors are no different from farmers who are trying to market their products, he said.
"They're Americans producing food, and so are we," he said.
There are regional seafood marketing groups around the country, such as the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute and the Maine Lobster Promotion Council. But there's no unified national marketing program or organization.
The coalition has been in the works for more than a year, with about 40 supporters from around the nation meeting in Seattle last month to agree on a plan.
The coalition, the group agreed, would be made up of five regional marketing boards representing New England and the Great Lakes; the Mid-Atlantic; Florida and the Gulf of Mexico; the Pacific coast; and Alaska and Hawaii.
Each region would develop marketing programs for its areas depending on the need. The boards would also collaborate to address national marketing issues.
The industry could have used a national campaign following last year's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Schactler said.
"You saw it all summer long, there were people thinking 'Maybe I ought to just quit eating seafood altogether. I can't figure it out. I'm confused. I'm going to become a vegetarian or eat chicken or something else,'" he said.
For funding, the coalition intends to line up a sponsor for a federal bill to establish what it's calling a National Seafood Marketing Fund. The goal is to get up to $100 million a year, with one possible funding source coming from duties and tariffs that are already imposed on seafood imports, Somers said.
An effort by the government 25 years ago to promote the industry didn't last.
The National Seafood Marketing Council was established by Congress in 1986 to encourage the consumption of domestically harvested seafood. It featured a national "spokesfish" dubbed the "sturgeon general."
But the government money ran out, the industry voted against paying for the program out of its own pocket and the council was disbanded.

AUGUSTA -- Can someone who has spent much of his career resolving conflicts overseas while working for the U.S. Foreign Service bring peace to Maine's fractious fishing industry?
It appears Maine will soon find out. The Legislature's Marine Resources Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to endorse Norman Olsen to be commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Olsen has worked as an associate coordinator for counterterrorism at the U.S. State Department, a senior adviser to the ambassador to Israel, a political affairs counselor in Israel during the Iraq War, and chief of staff of a team of diplomats in Kosovo that arranged a cease-fire between Serbian and ethnic Albanian forces.
If his nomination is confirmed by the Maine Senate, Olsen will have to handle disputes among groundfishermen, lobstermen, shrimpers, shellfish harvesters, sports fishermen, herring, tuna and alewife fishermen, environmentalists, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council.
Speaking at his confirmation hearing Wednesday, Olsen said he planned to build a sense of "community" among all the sectors of Maine's marine resources industry, explaining that the economic climate of the industry as a whole can improve when sectors cooperate.
"We in the marine resources industry have always thought of everything as a zero-sum game, one in which the extra dollar someone makes somehow comes out of our pocket," he said. "Nothing could be farther from the truth."
Representatives of several fishing sectors praised Olsen at the hearing. They liked his cool-headed diplomatic manner and his personal connections to Maine's fishing industry
Olsen is a fourth-generation fisherman. He grew up in Cape Elizabeth, and his father caught shrimp, whitefish, groundfish and lobsters.
Olsen began fishing for lobsters at age 12 and worked as a lobsterman for two years on his own 32-foot boat after graduating from Colby College with a degree in economics.
He also worked for a national company that harvested and processed surf clams and ocean quahogs.
"That's credibility you can't get any other way," said Tom Valleau, president of the Portland Fish Exchange. "He has the respect of the fishing industry."
One of the most controversial issues facing Olsen is whether lobsters caught as incidental catch in groundfish nets should be legal to sell in Maine ports. Because the practice is banned in Maine, many groundfishermen land their fish in Massachusetts ports, where those lobsters can be sold legally.
A proposal to allow such sales in Maine ports was defeated soundly in 2007 after the powerful lobster industry lobbied hard against it. When asked Wednesday what he thought of the idea, Olsen said he wanted to study the issue before making a decision.
James Odlin, a Portland groundfishermen, said he hopes Olsen's diplomatic skills will allow him to help the struggling groundfishing industry without threatening the livelihoods of lobstermen.
"I am hopeful that the new governor and commissioner can find a way for both fisheries to exist and bring the groundfishing industry back to the state of Maine," Odlin said. "There has to be a way to make that happen."

Bean's lobster business on roll

Full text: Maine Sunday Telegram
ST. GEORGE -- For years, Linda Bean had admired the picturesque wharfs and waterfront businesses in the villages on the St. George peninsula on Penobscot Bay.
She even went so far as to offer her name and phone number at one point to David Albano, owner of the Bay Lobster Co. and wharf in Port Clyde, in case he ever decided to sell. Then she forgot all about it, until Albano, who had stuck her number in a drawer nine years earlier, called her to ask if she was still interested.
On the threshold of a divorce and after years of not working, and at an age when many are seeking to kick back a little, Bean jumped at the chance at buying the business in 2007.
"I said, 'I sure would love to get involved, but you would have to teach me,'" said Bean.
Four years later, Bean, granddaughter of Maine's most famous retailer, L.L. Bean, is presiding over a growing lobster business as she approaches age 70. The mother of three sons in their 40s, and grandmother of four, Bean has built an empire that extends to four wharfs, a floating buying station, the midcoast's only lobster processing plant -- with another in the works -- plus other waterfront properties.
Her volume has grown from 400,000 pounds of lobster the first year to 4 million pound this year.
She has opened a chain of eight lobster cafes, with another due to open this spring. Her businesses are providing jobs for 156 workers, excluding the fishermen, and are well on their way to achieving her goal of creating new markets for Maine's lobstermen.
With the announcement last month that she had snagged the Walmart account for frozen cooked lobster claws, Bean became a key player in Maine's most valuable fishery.
The state's annual catch of about 75 million pounds is worth about $300 million to the roughly 6,000 licensed lobstermen. The industry employs thousands of others as crew members and at associated businesses, such as processing plants, restaurants, bait dealers and boat yards.
Bean's Walmart account was the result of a change in law this year that allows Maine companies to sell lobster claws and knuckles separately and offer value-added products for the first time. Previously, only whole lobsters, whole lobster tails in the shell and lobster meat picked out of the shell could be sold, due to concerns that undersized lobsters would be sold if the parts were separated.
The changes were designed in part to stop the flow of tens of millions of pounds of Maine lobster to Canada, where it was legal to process into parts. The processed lobster was then resold in the United States as a Canadian product.
It appears the law may be working. Not only is Bean selling her claws to Walmart, but another processor is looking at setting up shop at the former Stinson Seafood plant in Prospect Harbor.
The lobster processing plant at 17 Merrill Drive in Rockland was humming last Tuesday following a run of good weather and a plentiful haul.
Inside workers, wearing tall rubber boots to avoid the ever present lobster juice, separated the claws from the bodies. The claws were quickly cooked then plunged into a cooling bath. The smell of cooked lobster wafted throughout the plant. Several of the workers said dealing with mounds of lobster all day has had no impact on their own appetites for the crustacean.
Some of the claws were headed for the picking room where a couple dozen workers separated the meat from the shell, including the hard to get at knuckle portion. The meat was headed to her restaurants and other food service operators. The rest of the whole claws were flash-frozen, scored and packaged for Walmart.
Bean said she didn't know a thing about lobster when she got into the business. A business accounting major at Antioch College, Bean's business experience included a stint as a publisher and her position on the L.L. Bean board of directors.
Bean is probably best known for her outspoken conservative Republican views, aired during unsuccessful bids for Congress in 1988 and 1992. She played up her connections to the family's famous outdoor clothing company, a strategy that raised eyebrows even within her family.
In her new venture, Bean unabashedly exploits her connection to the famous retailer and Maine brand to market her products. She sells her live lobsters with a bracelet that identifies the port where the lobster was landed.
Some of her competitors say they can't help but admire her branding skills.
"Linda has got some good ideas. She is a strong marketer, which is ultimately good for the whole industry," said John Norton, president and chief executive officer of Cozy Harbor Seafood Inc. in Portland.
Cozy Harbor and Portland Shellfish Co. Inc. are the state's two biggest processors. Cozy Harbor processes about 5 million pounds of lobster a year, compared with Bean's 2 million pounds.
Bean spent her first year in the business learning everything Albano could teach her. Today, she said she depends heavily on her chief executive officer John Peterdorf's knowledge of the lobster market. But she is very hands-on in other aspects of the business. She works the crowds at trade shows, dollops lobster into rolls at country fairs and studies the fine print in all her business contracts.
The front seat of her late-model Volvo station wagon, which she drives at a stately pace around the peninsula oblivious to the line of cars behind her, overflows with business papers.
Bean's conservative views imbue her business strategy. Her deep distrust of Canada, which she calls a socialist state, influenced her entry into the business. One of the reasons she says she jumped at Albano's business was to protect it from an interested Canadian buyer.
She set the business up on a vertically integrated model, with separate companies contributing to each step of the supply chain. All of the businesses, from processing plants to restaurants, are separate companies that are held by Linda Bean's Perfect Maine LLC.
She said making each entity a separate business allows her to more closely monitor their profitability.
While vertical integration is not uncommon in the lobster industry, Bean has taken it a step further by opening up her own Linda Bean's Perfect Maine Lobster Roll restaurants. They include outlets in Del Ray Beach, Fla., where her grandfather retired; St. Thomas, the Virgin Islands; Nantasket Beach in Hull, Mass.; Portland, Port Clyde, Rockland and Camden.
She operates a mobile food stand and is working to open a new restaurant in April across from the L.L. Bean flagship store and campus in Freeport, which now houses a Linda Bean's Perfect Lobster Roll food stand.
Bean and several others in the industry are pursuing certification from the Marine Stewardship Council for the Maine lobster fishery. They believe that would make the fishery even more marketable to the growing number of food retailers interested in stocking only sustainably caught seafood.
But not everyone agrees MSC certification is the way to go. Jeff Holden, president of Portland Shellfish Co., said it could mean a record-keeping nightmare for fishermen and dealers. Marianne LaCroix, marketing director of the Maine Lobster Council, said others worry that if Maine fails to win certification it will reflect badly on a fishery long-recognized for its sustainable practices.
Whatever the outcome, the lobster business is looking up after two years of slumping demand due to the recession.
And Bean said she intends to keep growing. She is working on a line of new value-added products, such as ravioli stuffed with real chunks of lobster meat, which she has personally named Lobster Traps. Bean said her broker told her last week the frozen claws product, sold in one pound bags of five to six claws for $10, was flying off the shelves. Her sales force is also working to get the claws into more Maine retailers' freezer cases.
She sells them at her Port Clyde General Store for $7.99 a pound.
"It's a great commodity to be in," she said with a big smile.

Odor improving at HerbKomp facility

Full text: CLINTON -- A stinky problem that had become a public nuisance is now being fixed at the HerbKomp facility on Route 100, state officials say.
Most of the smelly odors had been created at the composting operation by seafood -- shellfish parts, animal bones and lobster-claw rubber bands -- that had been scattered around and not properly covered, according to inspections by the state Department of Agriculture.
Last month, complaints flooded in from neighbors, as well as town and state officials.
State officials gave HerbKomp's owner, Dwynn Williams, an outline of ways the facility could clean up its act and stop the bad smells.
This past week, those efforts appeared to be working.
"They've been cleaning up quite a bit -- the worst of it," said Mark Hedrich, nutrient management coordinator for the agriculture department. "We're just going to continue monitoring at this point, but we have been on top of it quite aggressively."
HerbKomp's owner, Dwynn Williams, couldn't be reached comment.
The company says on its website that it has developed "the best practice of processing aerobic compost" in Maine in response to increasing demand for quality soil for organic produce.
According to the website, HerbKomp's compost product, called Aerobic Digested Organic Matter, contains ingredients such as horse, cow and chicken manure, hay, clay, leaves, wood shavings, apples and water.
Complaints about odors from the facility came in October from five neighbors, Jeffrey Towne, who is chairman of the Board of Selectmen, and an official with the state Department of Environmental Protection.
In a letter written to Williams on Nov. 1, Hedrich outlined several ways of stanching the stink coming from the facility and said the matter would be referred to the state Attorney General's Office unless the "best practices" started in the next few weeks.
State officials inspected the facility three times in late October, according to Hedrich, and found the "offensive" odors "were resulting from shellfish and offal having been delivered to your site without appropriate amendment to minimize odors."
"Shellfish parts and large animal bones also were observed scattered about the site, as were rubber bands that had arrived at the site on lobster claws," Hedrich wrote.
The conditions were not in line with what the state considers "best management practices" and also violated state laws under the agriculture and nutrient statutes.
After talking it over Williams, state officials made several recommendations, including a review of covered materials and a compost management plan; no more delivering of fish or shellfish until it's handled properly; and removing rubber bands from lobster claws prior to arrival at the facility.
State officials also suggest a long-term goal of establishing a buffer of trees along the property's south side.

PORTLAND -- A team of 25 scientists surveying piers, docks and coves on the region's coast for invasive pests is documenting the growing problem of sea squirts as well as a newcomer, red alga, that's been spreading in southern New England.
The scientists wrapped up their weeklong survey Saturday by inspecting a cove and two marinas in Cape Elizabeth, South Portland and Freeport in southern Maine. Earlier in the week, the team visited sites in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
The goal is to develop a baseline inventory of marine animals and plants that have taken up residence in ocean waters where they don't naturally occur and determine if they pose threats to native organisms. The European green crab and the Asian shore crab, for instance, prey on commercially valuable shellfish, while other invasive species have been known to damage piers and pilings.
The worst group in recent years has been sea squirts, or tunicates, which are spreading across New England, said Jan Smith of the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.
"They're like a creeping mass and smother other things," he said. "We're finding it virtually everywhere and it's smothering native communities."
This is the fourth time since 2000 that scientists have surveyed the New England coastline to collect information on ocean invaders. The survey is coordinated by the MIT Sea Grant program, the Massachusetts Bays Program and the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management, with assistance from estuary programs in different states.
There are at least 64 plants and animals, ranging from sea anemones to barnacles and crabs, that are not native to the region and can now be found in New England waters, Smith said.
This year's project brought together a team of scientists from the U.S., Canada, Brazil and the Netherlands who have taken samples at marinas and along the shore and examined their findings in laboratories.
Scientists this year have been seeing a red alga spread in southern New England, Smith said. The alga, which is native to the Pacific Ocean, first showed up three years ago in Narragansett Bay, but has yet to cause any problems.
Scientists also came across a sponge-like organism on a dock near Newport, R.I., that they couldn't identify, he said.
The survey is important because it provides information about species that could hurt both the ocean and those who make a living off of it, said Curtis Bohlen, director of the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership, which provides assistance to the survey.
Off Maine, sea squirts increasingly have been showing up on the ocean floor and growing on lobster traps that are set along the coast, Bohlen said.
"My concern is as these things are coming in, they're rearranging our marine ecosystem in ways we don't really understand," Bohlen said. "The potential risk to the way we make a living in Maine's marine environment is significant, and we'd like to know that before it becomes a problems."

Distance doesn't seem to matter. No matter how far they are from the Gulf, waiters and waitresses around the nation are getting the same grilling by diners.
Is your seafood clean?
After months of watching news coverage of tar balls washing up on beaches and oil-soaked wildlife, customers are asking questions about the where their food was fished from, especially items closely associated with the Gulf, like shrimp and oysters.
"We have two oyster dishes on our menu, and people want to know where they are from," said Bryce Statham, owner of the Blue Moon Fish Co., in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla.
For some restaurants, the solution has been to add new items to the menu (alligator at one New Orleans eatery). Others have sought out the same seafood with a different geography (New Zealand grouper over Gulf Coast, for example).
Still others take a more blunt approach. While Dallas-area restaurants hung up "God Bless the Gulf" signs, another in upstate New York tweeted that they do NOT serve Gulf seafood.
The Associated Press contacted more than a dozen restaurants nationwide and many said the increased curiosity from customers hasn't necessarily cost them business. Rather, restaurateurs say a portion of their customers seek reassurance before ordering. It's the same sort of squeamishness lampooned recently in Doonesbury when Zonker, working as a waiter, assured a customer the crabs are "petroleum-free" and points out the latest satellite image of the spill on the man's placemat.
In reality, waiters and waitresses around the nation are getting pointers on ways to assure customers that their seafood is coming from either clean waters in the Gulf or from another part of the world.
This can be a balancing act. Restaurants typically want to support the devastated Gulf fishing industry, but also want to make clear they're steering clear of product from polluted water. Ken Vaughan, director of operations for Flying Fish restaurants, said his restaurants in the Dallas area and in Little Rock, Ark., and Memphis, Tenn., put up "God Bless the Gulf" signs, but they also tell customers who ask that their shrimp comes from reputable suppliers.
Jack's Oyster House in Albany, N.Y., recently told customers on Twitter and Facebook that "Jack's is NOT sourced from the Gulf."
In Florida, Statham said staff members check tags on the oysters so they can tell customers where they are from. Brad Lomax, owner of Water Street Restaurants in Corpus Christi, Texas, said they're training servers to explain that the shrimp is safe.
In Miami, the River Oyster Bar changed the look of its menu to show customers specifically where the oysters are coming from, said David Bracha, chef and owner. He also tells his staff to assure customers that the restaurant tries to buy fish locally when possible.
"I try to educate them on where the fish comes from," he said. "If a guest asks them or is concerned, they can speak about it intelligently."
Gulf seafood accounts for a bit more than 2 percent of the seafood consumed by Americans, according to industry estimates. Chefs tend to promote local products -- think Maine lobsters or Seattle salmon -- meaning restaurants beyond the South may serve few or no menu items from Gulf.
For instance, Mike Earp of Saltwater Seafood Market and Fry Shack in Raleigh says 95 percent of his product is from North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The Baltimore-based Phillips Seafood chain relies on crabmeat from a plant in Maryland as well as facilities overseas, a spokeswoman said.
For Gulf items that have become hard to come by -- or too costly -- many restaurants have replaced them with new items. Faced with a shortage of oysters, Cafe Adelaide in New Orleans started serving alligator sope (a traditional Mexican dish), and "it's selling pretty good" said sous chef Orlando Harris.
The Hillstone Restaurant Group, which runs Gulfstream restaurants in Los Angeles and Orange County, replaced its Florida black grouper Gulf sandwich with the newly named Crispy Fish Fillet made with New Zealand grouper.
Miami's River Oyster Bar switched to oysters from Seattle after prices for Gulf oysters "went through the roof," Bracha said. Similarly, Denver's Max Gill & Grill, said the restaurant stopped buying oysters from the Gulf soon after the spill and now only buys oysters from the west and northeast coasts, said general manager Eric Tittmann.
"A lot of people definitely ask about it," he said.
It's still not clear if that customer concern has translated into a nationwide drop in seafood restaurant business. Some Gulf state businesses are clearly affected. Vaughan of Flying Fish said the effects of the oil spill have cost them about 15 percent of their profits. A New Orleans restaurant, Bayona, filed a class action lawsuit against the companies involved with the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon rig for the loss of customers and revenue.
But other restaurants around the country say business is fine. Tittmann also said his Denver restaurant has actually gotten busier in the last eight months. Bracha in Miami said business has yet to be affected, though that could change with the currents.
"If the oil comes to Florida ... if it comes to the Keys ... people are going to be just freaked out," Bracha said. "You are going to see a lot less tourism and less people interested in eating seafood."

Associated Press Writers
NEW ORLEANS -- After three long months, the bleeding from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico has been finally, mercifully stanched. But in so many ways, the prognosis remains uncertain.
Which species will rebound, and which have been pushed beyond the brink? Has the oil accelerated the die-off of marshlands that protect one of America's great cities and make this the nation's second most-productive fishing region? What effect will the BP spill have on the future of deep-sea drilling -- at once boon and bane -- in the Gulf?
And, of more immediate concern to people along the nation's southern coast, where will the millions of as-yet uncollected, unburned, unseen gallons of oil from the blown-out Deepwater Horizon well end up?
Second-generation Plaquemines Parish resident Sandy Reno isn't sure she wants to wait around to find out the answers.
"I'm ready to pack up and leave," says Reno, 43, whose shrimper husband, like so many others along this coast, is now dependent on cleanup work from the company held responsible for the disaster. "When you've had enough, you've had enough. I've had enough already."
Just as the stumbling federal response to Hurricane Katrina five years ago exposed not just chinks, but spider web networks of fissures in our national armor, the failure to prevent and then quickly stop the spill has shaken many people's faith in American might.
"We're a superpower -- the United States," New Orleans chef and sometime fishing guide Eric Schutzman said recently as he took a break from carving up a batch of black drum and redfish caught in an unclosed section of Black Bay. "We put a man on the moon. You'd think we'd have enough brilliant minds to get it all cleaned up and get on with it."
Since the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 and sank 50 miles off the tip of Louisiana, as much as 184 million gallons of crude have hemorrhaged into the gulf.
To get an idea of what Gulf Coast residents might be facing, many have looked back to the region's last worst drilling accident -- the 1979 Ixtoc spill. It took Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, 10 months to contain the spill. By then, 140 million gallons of crude had bled into the gulf.
Wes Tunnell, associate director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, is traveling the region, looking for traces of the spill and speaking to people who lived through it. His blog is plastered with photos of red mangrove roots clogged with thin, weathered tar mats -- possibly from Ixtoc.
Tunnell and his colleagues interviewed 74-year-old Jose Chay, a longtime fisherman in Celestun, Yucatan. Chay told Tunnell that the spill forced locals to switch to jobs like salt mining, crabbing in the lagoon or making charcoal from the region's lush forests.
"They did these things for varying periods of time," Tunnell writes, noting that some started back fishing in about two years, but with poor results. "Others got back to fishing in 4-5 years when things seemed to be back to usual for the fin fish but not shellfish."
But, Chay told Tunnell, "it permanently killed all of the oysters and clams, the same thing we heard in Isla Arenas yesterday."
Large sections of the U.S. Gulf Coast -- which accounts for 60 percent to 70 percent of the oysters eaten in the U.S. -- have been closed to harvesting. It remains to be seen what effect the spill will have on the fishery.
Some watermen have been pulling up gape-shelled, dead oysters. But that is likely a byproduct of the state's efforts to keep the oil out of inland waters by diverting thousands of gallons of fresh water into the estuaries, says Mike Voisin, a member of the Louisiana Oyster Task Force.
A meeting is scheduled in early August to determine the next harvest season. But Voisin says it could be years before the spill's effects on the industry will be known.
"We always have three crops of oysters on the bottom, or three-year classes," says Voisin, owner of Motivatit Seafoods in Houma. "So when you're thinking about mortality, you're not just thinking about this year's harvest. You're thinking about 2010, '11 and '12's harvest."
Oysters, shrimp and other valuable commercial fisheries depend on the continued health of the marshlands that nurse and nurture the species upon which the industry rests.
Louisiana, home to 40 percent of the nation's coastal wetlands, has been losing 35 to 50 square miles of marsh a year for decades -- much of it from the ditching and canal digging activities connected to the oil industry. In places where oil has intruded, marsh grasses have turned brown and brittle, but it is unclear yet how deep the death goes.
When talking about the marshes to laypeople, chemical oceanographer Thomas Bianchi likes to use the analogy of a giant tea bag.
"When you put a tea bag in water, the tea that you see are organic compounds, that's coming from the tea leaves," says Bianchi, a professor at Texas A&M University. "So you get that kind of release from the normal healthy marshes as they grow and die."
With funding from the National Science Foundation, Bianchi is leading a team that will soon gather thousands of liters of water from Barataria Bay.
Through a process called reverse osmosis/electrodialysis, they will distill that down to hundreds of milliliters. That concentrate will be subjected to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and other processes to determine whether the marsh is dying at the roots, not just above the water line, and how much of the petroleum -- and the 1.8 million gallons of chemical dispersants dumped on it -- has gotten into the food chain.
Bianchi, who fled New Orleans and his job at Tulane University after losing his home to Hurricane Katrina, says his "gut feeling" is that the marshes have died below the water. If that is the case, he's concerned that this die-off could have a "cascading effect."
"It just makes the whole estuary more vulnerable."
Bianchi expects to have some preliminary test results in a matter of days or weeks. But it may well be two or three years before the spill's impact on the deep-sea environment, says Jeffrey Baguley, a marine biologist at the University of Nevada.
These communities of organisms are big players in the processing and recycling of organic carbon, says Baguley, who specializes in the study of marine invertebrates. There is still a lot of oil floating beneath the water's surface, and Baguley is concerned about how much of it will end up on the seafloor.
"We have organisms that live there in the deep sea that we're not sure of their overall function, their overall impact," he says. "So it's always prudent to err on the side of caution when you're impacting organisms you don't fully understand."
Another industry whose future is uncertain is deep-sea oil drilling. The federal courts have blocked one Obama administration drilling moratorium, but the Interior Department issued a new one this week. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is asking for a special legislative session to consider putting a constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would ban drilling within 10 miles of the state's beaches.
The notion of halting all deepwater drilling until we know what happened here might seem a no-brainer to many people in other parts of the country. But here, where many families have feet in both industries, people are seriously conflicted.
Even those who have been damaged most by the spill are now wholly dependent on the industry. Compensation payments and cleanup contracts from BP have put many in the region on a kind of artificial life support, forestalling what could be major life decisions.
And for some, this spill, coming on the heels of so many devastating hurricanes, has stretched the bonds of place.
If Sandy Reno could take her 13-year-old son and leave right now, she would.
"There was nothing down here for women after Katrina, anyway," she says, emerging from a pharmacy in the town of Port Sulphur, a 20-mile drive from her home in Boothville. "We used to have shops and a fitness center and a pool at the YMCA. We don't even have that anymore. This a man's place. Just look around."
But she knows there aren't many places where a man like her husband, George, 52, with a seventh-grade education, could run his own business and thrive.
"If he was to take a crew boat job or be a tug boat driver, I think he could do it," says Sandy Reno, who kept the books for the family's two shrimp boats -- the Captain Bubby and Little Dipper. "But that's not what he's done. He's always worked for himself."
Only now, he's working for BP -- and still waiting to be paid for more than a month's labor.
Work on the two relief wells intended to kill the well once and for all is expected to be completed next month. But experts say tar balls and oil mats will continue to wash ashore from Texas to Florida -- and perhaps beyond -- for years to come.
As Louisiana's poet laureate, Darrell Bourque might be expected to have written something about the spill. But he's still too overwhelmed.
"I don't know how yet to translate that into the language of a poem," the 68-year-old writer said from the family farm where he grew up near Opelousas in rural St. Landry Parish.
To a large extent, Bourque's poetry is grounded in his belief that humans are just extensions of the landscape.
"One of the great lies and the great myths we've told ourselves is that there's a division between the natural world and the human world," he says. "And I think we're as much an extension of the natural world as the plankton and the pelican."
As sympathetic as he is about the plight of fishermen, oil workers and others who are hurting, Bourque has tired of hearing people talk about losing their "way of life." As far as he is concerned, it's that "way of life" that brought the gulf to the edge of the abyss.

LUBEC -- Out on the mud flats in the easternmost nook of the United States, generations of clam diggers have dug deep into the muck for tasty soft-shells to satisfy New Englanders' cravings for steamers and fried clams.
These days, the digging isn't so good. The clam harvest in far eastern Maine has dropped sharply in recent years, and clam diggers say one big reason is an onslaught of the carnivorous moon snail.
The little-known mollusk that drills into clams and other shellfish and eats the meat inside has been multiplying. The besieged clam population has fallen, leaving diggers with fewer clams for the taking.
The snail sounds almost unreal: Mucous-oozing creatures emerging from the mud in the dark of night, drilling their way into unsuspecting clams with sandpaper-like tongues and leaving behind empty shells.
"It's like science fiction," said Brian Beal, a marine ecology professor at the University of Maine at Machias who's studied clams and snails for decades.
Clam diggers aren't happy.
For 30 years, Bob Varney, 55, has earned an honest day's pay on Lubec's flats by pulling his four-pronged clam rake over and over through the mud, clay and sand in search of the sweet "piss clams," so named because they squirt water through their necks at clammers walking by. The work is difficult and dirty, bringing barely $50 a day.
These days, Varney typically harvests 55 to 60 pounds in four or five hours. Not long ago, he could rake up double that, but the clams are spread thin nowadays. A growing number have deadly drill holes in their shells from the moon snails.
What concerns him most are the snails' volcano-shaped egg cases -- some of which can hold more than 1 million eggs -- that show up nearly everywhere he digs. "We didn't have anything like this even two or three years ago," Varney said, taking a break from digging. "They've just escalated."
Moon snails are native to the region, ranging from Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence to North Carolina. In Maine, their numbers go in cycles from area to area; biologists say there was a surge in the 1970s and '80s.
For now, there's no concern that the creatures will spread in abundance beyond far eastern Maine, one of the most productive clamming areas in Maine and New England. Thirty miles away, clam diggers don't even have an inkling about the snails, Beal said.
Some cultures consider the snails a delicacy, but in Maine they're just a nuisance. Beal said they may be more numerous in eastern Maine because of the decline of green crabs, which prey on the snails and clams.
That's bad news in a region where jobs are scarce and many make their livelihood from the land and the sea.
Some clammers work on fishing boats, rake blueberries and make Christmas wreaths. They cut wood and pick periwinkles -- a snail-harvesting practice known as "wrinkling" -- off the rocky ocean ledges. Many dig clams, which make their way to stores and restaurants across New England and the Northeast.
Clam harvests fluctuate, but the downturn has been severe in Cobscook Bay, a sprawling body of ocean water tucked against the Canadian border, known for its 20-foot tides, turbulent waters and rich ecosystem. The harvest in Lubec and other bay towns fell by 85 percent from 2006 to 2009 -- from about 800,000 pounds to about 100,000 -- according to the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Partly to blame for the decline are widespread outbreaks of "red tide," caused by a naturally occurring algae that produces a toxin that makes clam harvesting off limits, Beal said. But the rise of moon snails is the No. 1 reason.
On a recent day on a Lubec flat, Beal and some clammers found dozens and dozens of the snails and their small egg cases, which look like small pieces of rubber littered on the mud.
Harmless-looking and slow-moving, the creatures can turn deadly when they get hold of a clam under the mud, enveloping it with its slimy, mucous-oozing foot and softening the shell with an enzyme secretion. In just a day, they can drill a hole in the softened shell and eat the clam meat inside. "They just go in and slurp it up," Beal said.
On the flats, clammers in their rubber boots have a hard enough time of it without the snail invasion. They work in the wet and cold, sometimes sinking knee-deep into Jello-like mud pockets known as "honey pots" that can suck their legs down in a flash, trapping them until they can wiggle free, sometimes leaving a boot behind.
Lately, diggers have been getting less than $1 a pound (prices will probably be double that in August, when demand is highest).
In Lubec, a town of 1,500, the value of the harvest has fallen from $566,000 four years ago to just $39,000 last year, according to the state.
David Case, 34, said it's barely worth his while to dig clams these days. But there's little else around to make a buck, and he still has to put food on the table. "I always said I wouldn't dig clams for under $1 a pound," he said. "But if you don't have any money, what can you do?"
Dennis Huckins, 56, said the moon snail is a crook, taking money out of clam diggers' wallets. "It's a thief," he said. "It steals from you."
But many diggers keep at it because there's nowhere else to turn. Back in the day, Lubec was a bustling place with seafood processing plants, a busy downtown -- even a movie theater.
"There's nothing substantial here you can do," Huckins said. "How many Walmarts and McDonald's do you see? There's not a lot of industry here. You make your own."
For now, clam diggers have been removing snail egg cases -- more than 90,000 so far -- from the flats. Beal records their findings and the diggers usually dump the snails on their gardens as fertilizer. Some people think the moon snails could be processed, packaged and sold. "There's a market for moon snails somewhere in the world," Beal said. "Why not market ours?"

Portland Press Herald
PORTLAND -- With the lobster boat stopped near Fort Gorges, the delegation donned long rubber aprons and gloves and got a warning from Tom Martin to keep their hands away from the winch.
The Chinese business leaders gathered around as Martin, the owner of Lucky Catch Cruises, hauled up the traps. He explained the mechanism of the traps, told them that females with eggs must be thrown back, and showed them how to measure a lobster.
The one he held met the size standard -- at least 3 inches from the back of the eyes to the edge of the main body -- and could go into the tank.
"Big enough!" Martin said, to cheers from the group.
Friday's outing was part of a crash course on Maine's lobster industry for representatives of COFCO -- a conglomerate that includes China's largest food importer -- and Hopu Investment Management.
The group was in Maine at the invitation of ndependent candidate for governor Eliot Cutler, of Cape Elizabeth.
"I want them to understand Maine lobster is better than Australia and New Zealand lobster, that we produce enough to export to China, and that it is a sustainable fishery -- which is very important to China -- and that they and we can make a lot of money with trade going that way," Cutler said.
The delegation included Ning Gaoning, chairman of COFCO; Paul Liu, president of Ceroilfood, a subsidiary of COFCO; and Fang Fenglei, Hopu's chairman.
Cutler lived in China for two years, moving there to open an office for his law firm. He got to know Fang then, and in recent months met Ning through Fang.
Friday's schedule included a visit to Portland Shellfish Co., where the visitors tasted products and saw workers butcher live lobsters, pack tails for flash freezing and pick cooked meat by hand. They then had a lobster roll lunch at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute with representatives of the industry.
The day's activities combined business and fun, said Liu, who is based in New York. He said that, while there certainly is a market for lobster in China, more study is needed -- on issues including marketing, the catch and processing -- before the businesses decide whether to pursue opportunities in Maine.
"We'll do our homework, keep contact with people here and see what happens from there," he said.
The group learned that Maine's lobster catch is 75 million pounds a year, and that an estimated 35 million pounds could be available for export to China. That amount, which could be worth about $200 million a year, would be enough to consider pursuing, said Guy Cui, one of the partners in Hopu.
"Two hundred million dollars is something worth exporting. Twenty million is too small," he said.
Ning, who goes by "Frank," said he would first want to build the Maine brand in China, where lobster is now associated with Australia or Boston. He would work with frozen products before considering importing live lobster, which poses more logistical challenges.
Dane Somers, executive director of the Maine Lobster Promotion Council, said working with COFCO would be an enormous opportunity. He said it would broaden the market and help firm up prices for exports.
"That's a nice way of saying, 'Whoever pays the most gets the lobster,'" he said.
In November's election, Cutler will face Democrat Libby Mitchell, Republican Paul LePage and two other independents, Shawn Moody and Kevin Scott.
Arden Manning, the state Democrats' campaign coordinator, said it wasn't surprising that Cutler arranged to bring the delegation to Maine, given that he lived in China.
"It's hard to say you know what Mainers are going through if you live in China and, really, have lived in Washington before that. That might be a concern for Maine voters," he said.

Voters will decide June 8 whether the state should borrow $10.25 million to upgrade water infrastructure and improve water quality. The bond would be matched with $33.25 million in federal and private funds.
If approved, Question 5 would replenish two funds that lend money to communities and water districts on a revolving basis; as the loan is repaid with interest, the money is lent again.
The Safe Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund would receive $3.4 million that is needed to secure $17 million in federal money over the next two years.
There are more than 20 projects awaiting funding, according to Nancy Beardsley, director of the Division of Environmental Health at the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, which manages the fund.
The highest-priority projects are those that address a public health risk, she said, such as the presence of contaminants in water.
Many areas of Maine have relatively high concentrations of natural arsenic and uranium in its water, Beardsley said, noting the federal government has installed new safety limits for these chemicals in the past several years.
The department received requests to fund projects that would cost $42 million this year, and anticipates being able to spend only $18 million if the bond package is approved.
"We have more projects each year than we have money available," said Beardsley.
Question 5 also includes $3 million that would bring in an additional $15 million in federal money for the Wastewater Treatment Facility State Revolving Loan Fund.
Municipalities can borrow money from this to upgrade their sewer systems and eliminate combined sewer and storm-water overflow systems present in larger communities. This fund has been in place for 20 years and has loaned out over $500 million.
"We need to have federal money continue to flow into the fund to keep it going," said Stephen McLaughlin, engineering manager for the Bureau of Land and Water Quality at the Department of Environmental Protection, which manages the waste-water fund. "Currently, we have documented waste-water needs of another $500 million within the next five years that need to be dealt with."
If Question 5 is approved, $1 million will help towns without sewer systems work with homeowners and small businesses to build septic systems, cleaning up cesspools and straight pipes that still exist and dump sewage into streams.
Another $600,000 would go toward eliminating overboard discharge systems that, even when working properly, require the banning of shellfish harvesting around the state in anticipation of system failure.
In addition, $750,000 would go to investigate and clean up areas of hazardous contamination, and $600,000 more would be used to make grants that would enable poorer communities to build sewerage systems. This program would bring in a match of $900,000 in other funds.
Another $1 million would go to help farmers build irrigation ponds and wells to ease weather-related risk and reduce the environmental impact of pumping water from rivers. In the past decade, this program has protected 9,000 acres of crops worth $21 million, according to Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture Ned Porter.
Democrats generally support the bond package, saying investing in Maine's infrastructure will pay dividends in terms of creating jobs and preparing the state for the future.
Sen. Minority Leader Kevin Raye, R-Perry, said he expects voters to be more selective about bonds this year because of the precious state of the economy and what he considers to be excessive borrowing.
"Many issues that in past years could have sailed to passage are going to be rough sledding," he said. "The water bond is one that I think is extraordinarily valuable, especially given the federal match. I am hopeful that as voters go through that selective process that they look very carefully at it."

Full text: Associated Press Writers
BARATARIA BAY, La. -- As officials approached to survey the damage the Gulf oil spill caused in coastal marshes, some brown pelicans couldn't fly away Sunday. All they could do was hobble.
Several pelicans were coated in oil on Barataria Bay off Louisiana, their usually brown and white feathers now jet black. Pelican eggs were glazed with rust-colored gunk, and new hatchlings and nests were also coated with crude.
It is unclear if the area can even be cleaned, or if the birds can be saved. It is also unknown how much of the Gulf Coast will end up looking the same way because of a well that has spewed untold millions of gallons of oil since an offshore rig exploded more than a month ago.
"As we talk, a total of more than 65 miles of our shoreline now has been oiled," said Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who announced new efforts to keep the spill from spreading.
A mile-long tube operating for about a week has siphoned off more than half a million gallons in the past week, but it began sucking up oil at a slower rate over the weekend. Even at its best the effort did not capture all the oil leaking, and the next attempt to stanch the flow won't be put into action until at least Tuesday.
With oil pushing at least 12 miles into Louisiana's marshes and two major pelican rookeries now coated in crude, Jindal said the state has begun work on chain of berms, reinforced with containment booms, that would skirt the state's coastline.
Jindal, who visited one of the affected nesting grounds Sunday, said the berms would close the door on oil still pouring from a mile-deep gusher about 50 miles out in the Gulf. The berms would be made with sandbags and sand hauled in; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also is considering a broader plan that would use dredging to build sand berms across more of the barrier islands.
At least 6 million gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf, though some scientists have said they believe the spill already surpasses the 11 million-gallon 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska as the worst in U.S. history.
Obama administration officials continued defending their response while criticizing that of BP PLC, which leased the rig and is responsible for the cleanup. U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he is "not completely" confident that BP knows what it's doing.
"If we find they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, we'll push them out of the way appropriately," Salazar said. But federal officials have acknowledged that BP has expertise that they lack in stopping the deep-water leak.
In Barataria Bay, orange oil had made its way a good 6 inches onto the shore, coating grasses and the nests of brown pelicans in mangrove trees. Just six months ago, the birds had been removed from the federal endangered species list.
The pelicans struggled to clean the crude from their bodies, splashing in the water and preening themselves. One stood at the edge of the island with its wings lifted slightly, its head drooping -- so encrusted in oil it couldn't fly.
Wildlife officials tried to rescue oil-soaked pelicans Sunday, but they suspended their efforts after spooking the birds. They weren't sure whether they would try again. U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Stacy Shelton said it is sometimes better to leave the animals alone than to disturb their colony.
Pelicans are especially vulnerable to oil. Not only could they eat tainted fish and feed it to their young, but they could die of hypothermia or drowning if they're soaked in oil.
Globs of oil have soaked through containment booms set up in the area. Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said BP needed to send more booms. He said it would be up to federal wildlife authorities to decide whether to try to clean the oil that has already washed ashore.
"The question is, will it do more damage because this island is covered with the mess?" Nungesser said.
Officials have considered some drastic solutions for cleaning the oil -- like burning or flooding the marshes -- but they may have to sit back and let nature take care of it.
Plants and pelican eggs could wind up trampled to death by well-meaning humans. If the marshes are too dry, setting them ablaze could burn plants to the roots and obliterate the wetlands.
Flooding might help by floating out the oil, but it also could wash away the natural barriers to flooding from hurricanes and other disasters -- much like hurricanes Katrina and Rita washed away marshlands in 2005. State and federal officials spent millions rebuilding the much-needed buffer against tropical storms.
The spill's impact now stretches across 150 miles, from Dauphin Island, Ala. to Grand Isle, La.
On Sunday, oil reached an 1,150-acre oyster ground leased by Belle Chasse, La., fisherman Dave Cvitanovich. He said cleanup crews were stringing lines of absorbent boom along the surrounding marshes, but that still left large clumps of rust-colored oil floating over his oyster beds. Mature oysters might eventually filter out the crude and become fit for sale, but this year's crop of spate, or young oysters, will perish.
"Those will die in the oil," Cvitanovich said. "It's inevitable."
Each day the spill grows, so does anger with the government and BP. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa P. Jackson was headed Sunday to Louisiana, where she planned to visit with frustrated residents.
Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano were to lead a Senate delegation to the region on Monday to fly over affected areas and keep an eye on the response.
The leak may not be completely stopped until a relief well is dug, a project that could take months. Another effort that BP said will begin Tuesday at the earliest will shoot heavy mud, and then cement, into the blown well, but that method has never been attempted before in mile-deep water and engineers are not sure it will work.
The only thing that has kept leaking oil out of the Gulf so far is the mile-long tube siphoning oil from the well to a ship. BP spokesman John Curry told The Associated Press on Sunday that it siphoned some 57,120 gallons of oil within the past 24 hours, a sharp drop from the 92,400 gallons of oil a day that the device was sucking up on Friday.
The amount BP has collected in the mile-long tube has varied since it was installed last week. The device was siphoning 42,000 gallons of oil a day early that week, but at times Thursday, the siphon was collecting oil at a rate of as much as 210,000 gallons a day.
BP refused to provide day-by-day figures on how much oil the tube was diverting. Curry said the rate is expected to vary widely, in part because it is not just oil but also natural gas that is leaking. On Sunday, for instance, the siphon collected more than 7 million cubic feet of gas.
The head of the Senate's environmental committee, Democrat Barbara Boxer of California, has asked the Justice Department to determine whether BP made false and misleading claims about its ability to prevent a serious oil spill.
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs also told CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday that Justice Department officials have been to the region gathering information about the spill. However, he wouldn't say whether the department has opened a criminal investigation.
President Barack Obama has named a special independent commission to review what happened. The spill began after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana on April 20, killing 11 workers; the rig sank two days later.
The 6 million-gallon figure for the spill is based on an initial BP estimate that about 210,000 gallons were spilling out each day. It became obvious the company had been underestimating the leak Thursday, when it started siphoning the oil at a 210,000-gallon-a-day rate while more crude spilled into the water.
Greg Bluestein reported from Covington, La. Associated Press writers Mary Foster in in Barataria Bay, Matthew Daly in Washington, Kevin McGill in New Orleans and Associated Press photographer Gerald Herbert in Louisiana contributed to this report.

Full text: Maine Sunday Telegram
Jarod Bray is asking people to pay him not to catch lobsters.
For $1,350 a year, Bray will send the customer the identification tag -- required by law -- off one of his 800 lobster traps with a pledge not to fish it.
He said he reduces his carbon footprint by using less fuel, and his gear poses less risk to the endangered right whale.
Farmers get paid not to grow certain crops, so why not pay lobstermen not to catch lobsters, Bray asks.
Bray, who fishes with his father, Joe, off Matinicus Island, launched his "No Impact Trap" business and website, www.ecolobstercatch.com, last fall.
Although he has yet to find any takers, he said people have told him he is on to something.
"Everyone is trying to be green and eco-friendly," said Bray.
Known for creative marketing ploys, Maine's 4,330 lobster fishermen are casting about for new ways to broaden demand for the venerable crustacean.
Adopt-a-trap programs, peddling right off the boat or at farmer's markets and selling shares of the catch are among the recent innovations.
Lobstermen say they are just trying to cope with the uncertainty over what 2010 holds, following several years marked by soaring fuel costs, rock bottom lobster prices and, last summer, enough competition to trigger lobster wars.
"Every other week there is something challenging," said Dane Somers, executive director of the Maine Lobster Promotion Council.
The lobster promotion council is pushing the "new shell lobster," also known as softshell lobster, as the tastier alternative to hardshell specimens, which fetch higher prices because they are easier to ship.
"Some people are convinced it is sweeter and more tender and if you talk to chefs they love to get their hands on a nice new shell lobster," said Somers.
Lobstermen say the only thing that saved them from total disaster last year was a record catch. In 2009, Maine lobstermen hauled in 75.5 million pounds. But the lobster was worth a lot less -- $221 million, compared with the $244 million value of the 69.8 million pounds caught in 2008. Fishermen received $2.93 per pound last year, compared with $3.50 a pound in 2008 and the peak price of $4.63 a pound in 2005.
This year, lobstermen are worried not only about the troubled economy and whether Americans have regained their appetite for the luxury shellfish, but also about the price of bait. Federal regulators have imposed a quota on herring, a favored baitfish.
Although the lobster population has been deemed relatively healthy, there is growing scientific concern over the high level of lobstering, said David Etnier, deputy commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
"There is a lot of gear in the water and a lot of fishermen that could pose a long-term threat," said Etnier.
Such talk sends shivers through an industry that prides itself on its self-imposed sustainable fishing practices. In recent years, regulators have stepped in to require costly replacements of fishing gear and to restrict the entry of new lobstermen into the fishery.
Stuart Norton, owner of Three Sons Lobster and Fish in Portland, said although business has picked up around the holidays - he was busy with Mother's Day orders on Friday -- the days of people from out of state ordering a shipment on a whim show no signs of coming back.
Norton predicts the glut of lobsters will continue this summer, bad for the harvesters but great for consumers, with prices even better than last summer, when some retail markets were selling small soft shells for as little as $3.50 a pound.
"It is not going to be the luxury food it once was," Norton said.
Others are more optimistic. Somers said he has seen some encouraging signs. He said people who attended the European Seafood Exposition in Brussels last month and the International Seafood Show in Boston in March said they felt customers are coming back and the worst is behind them.
"Not that things are going to be wonderful," said Somers.
Long-time Yarmouth lobsterman Willis Spear said he is feeling more certain about the cost of bait, after his suppliers assured him they would have plenty on hand through August at least. He said all he can do is hope for the best.
"We are always cautiously optimistic or we would never go out," said Spear.

Full text: VENICE, La. (AP) -- A sense of doom settled over the American coastline from Louisiana to Florida on Saturday as a massive oil slick spewing from a ruptured well kept growing, and experts warned that an uncontrolled gusher could create a nightmare scenario if the Gulf Stream carries it toward the Atlantic.
President Barack Obama planned to visit the region today to assess the situation amid growing criticism that the government and oil company BP PLC should have done more to stave off the disaster. Meanwhile, efforts to stem the flow and remove oil from the surface by skimming it, burning it or spiking it with chemicals to disperse it continued with little success.
"These people, we've been beaten down, disaster after disaster," said Matt O'Brien of Venice, whose fledgling wholesale shrimp dock business is under threat from the spill.
"They've all got a long stare in their eye," he said. "They come asking me what I think's going to happen. I ain't got no answers for them. I ain't got no answers for my investors. I ain't got no answers."
He wasn't alone. As the spill surged toward disastrous proportions, critical questions lingered: Who created the conditions that caused the gusher? Did BP and the government react robustly enough in its early days? And, most important, how can it be stopped before the damage gets worse?
The Coast Guard conceded Saturday that it's nearly impossible to know how much oil has gushed since the April 20 rig explosion, after saying earlier it was at least 1.6 million gallons -- equivalent to about 2 1/2 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The blast killed 11 workers and threatened beaches, fragile marshes and marine mammals, along with fishing grounds that are among the world's most productive.
Even at that rate, the spill should eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history in a matter of weeks. But a growing number of experts warned that the situation may already be much worse.
The oil slick over the water's surface appeared to triple in size over the past two days, which could indicate an increase in the rate that oil is spewing from the well, according to one analysis of images collected from satellites and reviewed by the University of Miami. While it's hard to judge the volume of oil by satellite because of depth, it does show an indication of change in growth, experts said.
"The spill and the spreading is getting so much faster and expanding much quicker than they estimated," said Hans Graber, executive director of the university's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing. "Clearly, in the last couple of days, there was a big change in the size."
Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, said it was impossible to know just how much oil was gushing from the well, but said the company and federal officials were preparing for the worst-case scenario.
In an exploration plan and environmental impact analysis filed with the federal government in February 2009, BP said it had the capability to handle a "worst-case scenario" at the Deepwater Horizon site, which the document described as a leak of 162,000 barrels per day from an uncontrolled blowout -- 6.8 million gallons each day.
Oil industry experts and officials are reluctant to describe what, exactly, a worst-case scenario would look like -- but if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and carries it to the beaches of Florida, it stands to be an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions.
The Deepwater Horizon well is at the end of one branch of the Gulf Stream, the famed warm-water current that flows from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic. Several experts said that if the oil enters the stream, it would flow around the southern tip of Florida and up the eastern seaboard.
"It will be on the East Coast of Florida in almost no time," Graber said. "I don't think we can prevent that. It's more of a question of when rather than if."
At the joint command center run by the government and BP near New Orleans, a Coast Guard spokesman maintained Saturday that the leakage remained around 5,000 barrels, or 200,000 gallons, per day.
But Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, appointed Saturday by Obama to lead the government's oil spill response, said no one could pinpoint how much oil is leaking from the ruptured well because it is about a mile underwater.
"And, in fact, any exact estimation of what's flowing out of those pipes down there is probably impossible at this time due to the depth of the water and our ability to try and assess that from remotely operated vehicles and video," Allen said during a conference call.
The Coast Guard's Allen said Saturday that a test of new technology used to reduce the amount of oil rising to the surface seemed to be successful.
During the test Friday, an underwater robot shot a chemical meant to break down the oil at the site of the leak rather than spraying it on the surface from boats or planes, where the compound can miss the oil slick.
From land, the scope of the crisis was difficult to see. As of Saturday afternoon, only a light sheen of oil had washed ashore in some places.
The real threat lurked offshore in a swelling, churning slick of dense, rust-colored oil the size of Puerto Rico. From the endless salt marshes of Louisiana to the white-sand beaches of Florida, there is uncertainty and frustration over how the crisis got to this point and what will unfold in the coming days, weeks and months.
The concerns are both environmental and economic. The fishing industry is worried that marine life will die -- and that no one will want to buy products from contaminated water anyway. Tourism officials are worried that vacationers won't want to visit oil-tainted beaches. And environmentalists are worried about how the oil will affect the countless birds, coral and mammals in and near the Gulf.
"We know they are out there" said Meghan Calhoun, a spokeswoman from the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans. "Unfortunately the weather has been too bad for the Coast Guard and NOAA to get out there and look for animals for us."
Fishermen and boaters want to help contain the oil. But on Saturday, they were again hampered by high winds and rough waves that splashed over the miles of orange and yellow inflatable booms strung along the coast, rendering them largely ineffective. Some coastal Louisiana residents complained that BP, which owns the rig, was hampering mitigation efforts.
"I don't know what they are waiting on," said 57-year-old Raymond Schmitt, in Venice preparing his boat to take a French television crew on a tour. He didn't think conditions were dangerous. "No, I'm not happy with the protection, but I'm sure the oil company is saving money."
As bad as the oil spill looks on the surface, it may be only half the problem, said University of California Berkeley engineering professor Robert Bea, who serves on a National Academy of Engineering panel on oil pipeline safety.
"There's an equal amount that could be subsurface too," said Bea. And that oil below the surface "is damn near impossible to track."
Louisiana State University professor Ed Overton, who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills, worries about a total collapse of the pipe inserted into the well. If that happens, there would be no warning and the resulting gusher could be even more devastating because regulating flow would then be impossible.
"When these things go, they go KABOOM," he said. "If this thing does collapse, we've got a big, big blow."
BP has not said how much oil is beneath the Gulf seabed Deepwater Horizon was tapping, but a company official speaking on condition, confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels -- a frightening prospect to many.
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said that he has asked both BP and the Coast Guard for detailed plans on how to protect the coast.
"We still haven't gotten those plans," said Jindal. "We're going to fully demand that BP pay for the cleanup activities. We're confident that at the end of the day BP will cover those costs."
Obama has halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster.
As if to cut off mounting criticism, on Saturday White House spokesman Robert Gibbs posted a blog entitled "The Response to the Oil Spill," laying out the administration's day-by-day response since the explosion, using words like "immediately" and "quickly," and emphasizing that Obama "early on" directed responding agencies to devote every resource to the incident and determining its cause.
In Pass Christian, Miss., 61-year-old Jimmy Rowell, a third-generation shrimp and oyster fisherman, worked on his boat at the harbor and stared out at the choppy waters.
"It's over for us. If this oil comes ashore, it's just over for us," Rowell said angrily, rubbing his forehead. "Nobody wants no oily shrimp."

Full text: VENICE, La. (AP) -- An oil spill that threatened to eclipse even the Exxon Valdez disaster spread out of control with a faint sheen washing ashore along the Gulf Coast Thursday night as fishermen rushed to scoop up shrimp and crews spread floating barriers around marshes.
The spill was bigger than imagined -- five times more than first estimated -- and closer. Faint fingers of oily sheen were reaching the Mississippi River delta, lapping the Louisiana shoreline in long, thin lines.
"It is of grave concern," David Kennedy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press. "I am frightened. This is a very, very big thing. And the efforts that are going to be required to do anything about it, especially if it continues on, are just mind-boggling."
The oil slick could become the nation's worst environmental disaster in decades, threatening hundreds of species of fish, birds and other wildlife along the Gulf Coast, one of the world's richest seafood grounds, teeming with shrimp, oysters and other marine life. Thicker oil was in waters south and east of the Mississippi delta about five miles offshore.
The leak from the ocean floor proved to be far bigger than initially reported, contributing to a growing sense among many in Louisiana that the government failed them again, just as it did during Hurricane Katrina. President Barack Obama dispatched Cabinet officials to deal with the crisis.
Cade Thomas, a fishing guide in Venice, worried that his livelihood will be destroyed. He said he did not know whether to blame the Coast Guard, the federal government or oil company BP PLC.
"They lied to us. They came out and said it was leaking 1,000 barrels when I think they knew it was more. And they weren't proactive," he said. "As soon as it blew up, they should have started wrapping it with booms."
The Coast Guard worked with BP, which operated the oil rig that exploded and sank last week, to deploy floating booms, skimmers and chemical dispersants, and set controlled fires to burn the oil off the water's surface.
The company has requested more resources from the Defense Department, especially underwater equipment that might be better than what is commercially available. A BP executive said the corporation would "take help from anyone."
Government officials said the blown-out well 40 miles offshore is spewing five times as much oil into the water as originally estimated -- about 5,000 barrels, or 200,000 gallons, a day.
At that rate, the spill could eclipse the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- the 11 million gallons that leaked from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989 -- in the three months it could take to drill a relief well and plug the gushing well 5,000 feet underwater on the sea floor.
Ultimately, the spill could grow much larger than the Valdez because Gulf of Mexico wells tap deposits that hold many times more oil than a single tanker.
Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP Exploration and Production, had initially disputed the government's larger estimate. But he later acknowledged on NBC's "Today" show that the leak may be as bad as federal officials say. He said there was no way to measure the flow at the seabed, so estimates have to come from how much oil rises to the surface.
Mike Brewer, 40, who lost his oil spill response company in the devastation of Hurricane Katrina nearly five years ago, said the area was accustomed to the occasional minor spill. But he feared the scale of the escaping oil was beyond the capacity of existing resources.
"You're pumping out a massive amount of oil. There is no way to stop it," he said.
An emergency shrimping season was opened to allow shrimpers to scoop up their catch before it is fouled by oil. And shrimpers were being lined up to use their boats as makeshift skimmers in the shallows.
This murky water and the oysters in it have provided a livelihood for three generations of Frank and Mitch Jurisich's family in Empire, La.
Now, on the open water just beyond the marshes, they can smell the oil that threatens everything they know and love.
"Just smelling it, it puts more of a sense of urgency, a sense of fear," Frank Jurisich said.
The brothers hope to get all the oysters they can sell before the oil washes ashore. They filled more than 100 burlap sacks Thursday and stopped to eat some oysters. "This might be our last day," Mitch Jurisich said.
Without the fishing industry, Frank Jurisich said the family "would be lost. This is who we are and what we do."
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Thursday so officials could begin preparing for the oil's impact. He said at least 10 wildlife management areas and refuges in his state and neighboring Mississippi are in the oil plume's path.
The declaration also noted that billions of dollars have been invested in coastal restoration projects that may be at risk. He also asked the federal government if he could call up 6,000 National Guard troops to help.
As dawn broke Thursday in the oil industry hub of Venice, about 75 miles from New Orleans and not far from the mouth of the Mississippi River, crews loaded an orange oil boom aboard a supply boat at Bud's Boat Launch. There, local officials expressed frustration with the pace of the government's response and the communication they were getting from the Coast Guard and BP officials.
"We're not doing everything we can do," said Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish, which straddles the Mississippi River at the tip of Louisiana.
Tension was growing in towns like Port Sulphur and Empire along Louisiana Highway 23, which runs south of New Orleans along the Mississippi River into prime oyster and shrimping waters.
Companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips have facilities nearby, and some residents are hesitant to criticize BP or the federal government, knowing the oil industry is as much a staple here as fishing.
"I don't think there's a lot of blame going around here. People are just concerned about their livelihoods," said Sullivan Vullo, who owns La Casa Cafe in Port Sulphur.
A federal class-action lawsuit was filed late Wednesday on behalf of two commercial shrimpers from Louisiana, Acy J. Cooper Jr. and Ronnie Louis Anderson.
The suit seeks at least $5 million in compensatory damages plus an unspecified amount of punitive damages against Transocean, BP, Halliburton Energy Services Inc. and Cameron International Corp.
In Buras, La., where Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005, the owner of the Black Velvet Oyster Bar & Grill couldn't keep his eyes off the television. News and weather shows were making projections that oil would soon inundate the coastal wetlands where his family has worked since the 1860s.
It was as though a hurricane was approaching, maybe worse.
"A hurricane is like closing your bank account for a few days, but this here has the capacity to destroy our bank accounts," said Byron Marinovitch, 47.
"We're really disgusted," he added. "We don't believe anything coming out of BP's mouth."
Signs of the 2005 hurricane are still apparent here: There are schools, homes, churches and restaurants operating out of trailers, and across from Marinovitch's bar is a wood frame house abandoned since the storm.
A fleet of boats working under an oil industry consortium has been using booms to corral and then skim oil from the surface.
BP conducted a test burn on Wednesday, but abandoned a plan to set fire to more oil after weather conditions deteriorated. The attempt to burn some of the oil came after crews operating submersible robots failed to activate a shut-off device that would halt the flow.
Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was briefed Thursday on the issue, said his spokesman, Capt. John Kirby. But Kirby said the Defense Department has received no request for help, nor is it doing any detailed planning for any mission on the oil spill.
Obama dispatched Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson to help with the spill. The president said the White House would use "every single available resource" to respond.
Obama has directed officials to aggressively confront the spill, but the cost of the cleanup will fall on BP, White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said.

Full text: Maine Sunday Telegram
CASCO BAY -- New listing: Turnkey blue mussel farm with strong brand awareness, three mussel rafts with new predator nets, 60,000 pounds of market-ready inventory, a 41-foot processing barge filled with equipment, a 27-foot commuter boat with trailer and state leases.
Asking price: $275,000.
"And part of the package are a lot of little tips," said owner Toleff Olson, who is throwing in 160 hours of special training.
Olson, of South Portland, is selling his 10-year-old Bangs Island Mussels farm off Clapboard Island, believed to be the first commercial rope-grown mussel operation on the East Coast. Olson is focusing full time instead on his seaweed venture, Ocean Approved, which is one of the first, if not the only, cultivated kelp businesses in the country.
Olson is hoping his mussel farm will catch the eye of an enterprising Mainer who can see the advantages of working on the open water rather than in a cubicle.
As his business partner, Paul Dobbins of Falmouth, points out, it is hard to beat the 11/2 mile commute out to the processing barge from Falmouth Town Landing, a ride that often features glimpses of bald eagles and nesting ospreys.
"And you cannot ask for a more beautiful office," said Dobbins.
Olson is getting out of blue mussel farming at a time when the sector is growing. Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, said the market for the edible bivalves is booming.
"Farm-raised has a very high meat yield, and they are a reasonably priced seafood," he said.
Belle said he expects to see a big turnover in aquaculture farms in the future as the first generation of aquaculturists who set up the state's trout and oyster farms in the 1970s begins to retire. Those early operators tended to hold graduate degrees from marine biology programs, and idealistic ambitions.
"They were the Cousteau kids, who were viewing aquaculture as a way to feed the world," said Belle, referring to the pioneering marine conservationist Jacques-Yves Cousteau.
The new generation of aquaculturists has a more practical approach. Many are ex-commercial fishermen driven out of the groundfishing business, or young adults from fishing families who cannot obtain one of the limited number of state permits for other fisheries.
In Maine, the wild harvest of blue mussels is much greater than the cultivated harvest. In 2009, the roughly 33 fishermen licensed to use draggers on wild mussel beds landed 14.7 million pounds of blue mussels worth $1.2 million, according to preliminary data from the state Department of Marine Resources. The state's 10 mussel farms, about half of which are rope-grown operations, produced a combined 805,899 pounds of mussels, worth $999,000 last year.
Working a mussel farm is physically demanding. There can be frequent shutdowns because of toxic red tide and or heavy rains that degrade water quality.
But the job is not particularly time-consuming, said Olson. In the winter, he heads out to the barge twice a week with his helper, Bernie Sutherland, of Portland. In the busy summer season, he takes on another couple of workers and adds another day or two a week.
"There is plenty of time left to surf," said Olson.
The mussel ropes are attached to rafts, protected by thick nets from eider ducks, which have a voracious appetite for the shellfish.
The water around the rafts is particularly clear, thanks to the mussels, which filter 25 gallons of water each in 24 hours.
With the help of a power winch, Olson and Sutherland haul up the 35-foot ropes, each loaded with 250 to 300 pounds of mussels as well as barnacles, starfish, sea squirts and other freeloaders. The mussels are mechanically knocked off the ropes and shoveled into a sorter. Undersized mussels, called spat, are collected for use for the next crop.
The sorted mussels are then fed into a debearding machine. They emerge clean and ready for market.
The farmers then wash down all evidence of mussels from the decks so as not to attract gulls.
While Olson and Dobbins will reveal financial details of the operation to serious buyers only, they say the farm makes enough to support two families.
Consummate salesmen, the two say demand for mussels began to skyrocket once the stock market turned around. Last year, they doubled their sales, Olson said.
Olson said he takes pride in the reputation of his mussels and wants that reputation to continue under the new owners. The Bangs Island Mussels have national brand recognition and have been featured by Martha Stewart and gourmet magazines.
Mussel farming on suspended ropes is considered an environmentally benign form of aquaculture compared to finfish farming, which can pollute and cause other environmental problems, another selling point, said Scott Balfour, Olson's broker.

For years, the Old Orchard Beach Conservation Commission lay dormant for lack of interest. It was brought back to life by several pressing environmental issues.
"Our dune system needed to be monitored. We needed more cataloguing of wetlands as more development came about," said Andrea Berlin, the commission's chair.
Eighteen months after the Town Council re-created it, the commission has landed a grant to explore the town's potential to generate wind power, taken on management of the town's parks and started a community garden project.
Old Orchard Beach and other communities have revived their conservation commissions after years of hibernation. The groups are taking on environmental tasks at the local level that no one else was addressing, such as combating the spread of invasive species, restoring eel grass beds and protecting lobster grounds.
Forty years ago, more than 200 of Maine's 454 cities and towns had active conservation commissions. The number dwindled to about 40 by 2007, said Bob Shafto, former chairman of the Falmouth Conservation Commission.
The commissions came into fashion during what Shafto calls Maine's great environmental awakening, when federal clean-water and clean-air laws were established and land-use and anti-pollution measures won bipartisan support in the state Legislature.
The state authorized commissions to inventory open land, identify land with high conservation value and take steps to protect it through acquisition or easements.
But land conservation by public entities raised thorny issues, such as whether it's the proper role for a municipality to buy private lands and remove them from the tax rolls. Land deals proved problematic, since the purchase prices were public.
"A lot of landowners didn't want to see their names in the paper," said Shafto.
Private, nonprofit land trusts started to replace conservation commissions in the 1980s. Today, there are more than 100 across the state.
"The local land trust became the de facto conservation commission." said Shafto.
Conservation commissions have remained dominant in other New England states; they operate in 216 of New Hampshire's 234 municipalities.
While state and local land trusts have done a great job protecting land from development, Shafto said, there is little structure for environmental protection on the local level. So he resurrected the Maine Association of Conservation Commissions in 2007, and is now its executive director.
Since then, 15 more municipalities have revived their commissions, and another half-dozen are considering it, said Shafto. The association now has 68 member communities.
"People are realizing this is the last generation with a chance to protect the rural character and the Maine-ness of their towns," he said.
Some conservation commissions continue to focus on land acquisition. In Wells, for example, the conservation commission created a land bank, which voters continue to support with an annual infusion of $50,000 to $70,000.
Others have branched out into other areas. The Kennebunkport Conservation Commission organized a campaign in 2008 to reduce the use of pesticides and other lawn chemicals that harm the town's lobstering grounds and shellfish beds.
Lawns all over town now sprout little flags emblazoned with the Lawns for Lobsters logo. The conservation commission also snagged a grant to put up wind turbines to partially power the police and fire stations.
"We have been pretty active," said Sarah Lachance, the commission's chair.
In Old Orchard Beach, the conservation commission has discovered that an ambitious agenda can ruffle feathers.
The conservation commission was putting finishing touches on the community garden it had created in a 50-acre woodland park attached at the town-owned Ballpark when the Town Council voted last month to shut down the garden.
Now, the commission is gathering signatures in protest. Berlin said her group is just trying to conserve and enhance open space for residents.
"We are trying against all odds," she said.

LUBEC -- Clam diggers in the Lubec area are fighting a devastating predator, moon snails, and are desperate for help.
Landings of softshell clams in the Cobscook Bay area have decreased 100 percent in the last two decades, Dr. Brian Beal of the University of Maine at Machias said Friday, and moon snails are to blame.
The explosion in the moon snail population seems to be concentrated Down East, a loss confirmed by more than a dozen clam diggers who attended a Lubec Shellfish Committee meeting Friday.
Beal said that last spring volunteers collected snails and collars -- the sand-constructed egg cases of the snails -- and in one area in Lubec, 3,273 collars were collected in one day. Each collar contains 1.3 million moon snail eggs.
"If you were a clam digger in Freeport right now, you could dig five bushels of clams at low tide," Beal told more than a dozen diggers gathered in Lubec on Friday. But pickings are mighty slim in Cobscook, he said, an area where 5 million clams were dug not too many years ago.
"The saddest thing of all is that this is not a sardine plant. This is not a paper mill. When 100 jobs are lost in the clam industry in Lubec, nobody pays attention," Beal said. "This is a human loss."
Lubec has the largest clam flat area in the state and the smallest yield due to the predator moon snail.
"This is a community issue," digger Julie Keene of Trescott said. "It's about a heck of a lot more than just clams. We've been reduced to picking [periwinkles]. We're starving. We're losing our homes."
Clammer Shawn Tinker said, "Yesterday, we had some clam diggers come up here from southern Maine. They couldn't even get a bushel and they'll never come back again."
Beal recently conducted scientific trials in the Haul Up bay area of Lubec. His findings revealed that the carnivorous moon snails are having a catastrophic effect on soft-shelled clams.
Beal seeded the clam flats at Haul Up with 1.5 million juvenile clams in May 2008. When the clams were retrieved in November, 80 percent were dead.
"We expected death and destruction, and we found it. This is pathetic," he said. In addition to finding the dead clams -- each with the trademark circular hole bored into their shells by the moon snail -- Beal found hundreds of the egg-filled collars.
Once a productive clam bed, the Haul Up is barren today. "There are no clams there now," Beal said.
"If this is a microcosm of what is going on in the rest of Lubec, this is a very big deal. These snails are wreaking havoc and it is scary," Beal said. Although green crabs, not a native species, also eat clams, Beal said the majority of damage is done by the snails.
How serious is the problem? One digger summed up thusly: ""I used to be a clammer when you could still find clams," he said.
The diggers appealed to John P. Graham, Rep. Michael Michaud's Deputy Chief of Staff, for help, particularly in light of Beal's recent denial by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a grant that would not only have decreased the moon snail population, but would have put dozens of local people to work mitigating the losses.
Beal's grant would have provided seasonal jobs for 40 shellfish restoration workers, five hatchery jobs and two field coordinators. His plan was to restore and enhance the clam flats.
With the loss of the grant, Beal and the clam diggers are resorting to removing any moon snails and collars on a volunteer basis.
Other options discussed were marketing the moon snails -- they are a delicacy in Korea.
Following the meeting, Graham said Michaud had sent him to hear the clam diggers' concerns. "Boy, I'm glad I'm here," he told the clammers. "We have heard you loud and clear." Graham said he would immediately begin looking into how Michaud could help Beal obtain some restoration and mitigation grants.

PHIPPSBURG -- For months, Dick Hill has been nervously watching the erosion at Popham Beach State Park.
Since November, the shifting Morse River has eaten away the sand dunes to within 25 yards of the park's bath house and septic system, toppling hundreds of trees and further threatening a beach that for the past few years disappears at each high tide. Last week, Hill organized a meeting to rally support for a dredge-and-fill operation to put the Morse River back on its original course -- a move opposed by abutting landowners.
But this weekend, an unusual trifecta of ocean surf and tides could solve the decades-old erosion of Popham Beach.
"Mother nature is going to do the heavy lifting for free," state marine geologist Stephen Dickson gleefully predicted last week.
Dickson said the storm system on Thursday and Friday created a tidal surge and a pounding surf from 10- to 15-foot waves offshore, followed by astronomical high tides Saturday and today. That may be enough to recut the original channel, which Dickson said will result in a visibly enlarged beachfront with room for sunbathers even at high tide as early as this summer.
"You might see this once in a lifetime," said Dickson, who has spent his professional career studying the sands at the mouth of the Kennebec River.
The sands at Popham Beach have been shifting since the glaciers departed 20,000 years ago, leaving behind mountains of sand that washed down the Kennebec River to form a beach system unique to the Maine coast. Today, sands extend out several miles along an area stretching from Small Point Beach at the tip of Phippsburg Peninsula to Reid Sate Park at the tip of the Georgetown peninsula on the mouth of Sheepscot River.
The sandbars attract birds. Sand dollars cover the sandy underwater delta.
The area is a magnet for winter flounder, which prefer sandy ocean bottoms.
The Morse River, which lies on the western end of three-mile long Popham Beach, carries the tides from the ocean into the marshes behind the beach. The river channel naturally changes course every 15 years or so, moving eastward and back, from a straight path to the ocean to an angled approach.
"Like a tail on a dog wags back and forth," said Dickson.
But for the past decade, the tail has continued to wag toward the state park, causing the beach to erode more than at any time in the past century.
A series of easterly storms in the past couple of years accelerated the erosion.
That pushed the high tide mark inland by about 180 feet -- to within 75 feet of one of two new bath houses that opened last summer, part of a $1.4 million improvement project.
Hundreds of trees fell into the river. With about 10 feet of shoreline disappearing each week, park officials obtained a special permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in November for a project to stem the erosion.
The permit allowed the state to rig a temporary sea wall by bundling the fallen trees and securing them with ropes to others on high ground. The temporary wall has worked.
"We have lost inches rather than hundreds of feet since we did that in early November," said John Picher, director of engineering and realty at the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands.
At the same time, bureau officials met owners of property abutting the Morse River. They hoped to get permission to cut a channel through the sand bars now blocking the river's direct outlet to the ocean, and to block off the new channel that has been carved out.
The abutters, including the Bates-Morse Mountain Conservation Area, the Small Point Association and the Nature Conservancy of Maine, said they were not interested in human intervention in the area, preferring to let nature take its course.
Laura Sewall, director of the Bates-Morse Mountain Conservation Area, said it was not clear that cutting a channel would permanently solve the problem and abutters were worried about how the work would affect wildlife. The conservation area is used for educational research.
"It could not serve as a laboratory that teaches us about natural processes," said Sewall.
Clammers were equally displeased with the prospect of human interference and the potential loss of clam beds that had been uncovered by the changing course of the river.
"Who is going to pay the clammers for the loss of all of these clams?" asked Richard Lemont, a former longtime chairman of the Phippsburg Shellfish Committee.
But beachfront residents such as Dick Hill, worried that the Morse River would erode the beach in front of their homes, were anxious to see the channel cut.
"My family has been going to that park since the turn of the last century," said Hill.
He said if the erosion were to reach the park's septic system, the entire beach area might have to be shut down because of the resulting pollution.
Other visitors to the beach -- there are 175,000 annually, making it one of the most heavily used state parks in Maine -- say it would be great if they no longer were forced to abandon the beach for a couple of hours around each high tide.
"I just want to make sure it is still here so we can use it," said Susie Reinheimer of Bowdoinham, who was riding her horse, Cody, on the beach last week.
Will Harris, Bureau of Parks and Lands director, said the channel-cut proposal has now been shelved, and moving the building and septic system is not financially feasible. No other practical solutions have surfaced.
"We have done pretty much what we can do," said Harris.
Which means Harris and others are hoping that Dickson is right, and the storms and high tides this weekend will deepen a new fledgling channel that has developed and send the Morse River back on a straight course. After Thursday and Friday, several more feet had been eaten into the shoreline and more trees had toppled over near the bath house.
But there were signs that the erosion had shifted further east. Dickson said it will be clear by Wednesday, once the high tides wane, whether the river has changed course.
He said the new channel has to be scoured out to a depth greater than the existing channel, like a seesaw. Then the sand will begin to build back on the park side of Morse River.
"It could tip the balance and help save the Popham State Park," said Dickson.

PORTLAND -- The New England shellfish industry faces the threat of widespread red tide outbreaks this spring and summer that could force hundreds of miles of clam flats to be closed and lead to clam shortages.
A survey of the ocean bottom off New England last fall provides evidence there will be a significant bloom of the toxic algae that cause red tide, federal and state officials said Wednesday.
This year's bloom could be similar to those of 2005 and 2008 that shut down shellfish beds from Maine to Cape Cod for months.
Red tide has become more frequent and severe in recent years, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in economic losses. With more red tide being forecast, the outlook is bleak for clam diggers who have had to contend with major outbreaks in three of the past five years.
"It's going to be devastating," said Butch Taylor, owner of C&S Seafood in Cushing, which buys clams from more than 100 clammers in the midcoast Maine region.
Red tide is caused by naturally occurring algae that produce a toxin that shellfish absorb as they feed. Red tide taints clams and mussels, making them unsafe for people to eat, but poses no risk to people who eat fish, lobster, scallops and shrimp. Officials stress that clams and mussels on the market are safe, given the regulatory safeguards in place.
Red tide outbreaks have occurred periodically for decades, but some of the worst have occurred in the past five years.
Major blooms in 2005 and 2008 shut down hundreds of miles of shellfish beds in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Last summer, nearly the entire Maine coast was shut down at one point.
Scientists each fall survey the ocean bottom to determine the abundance of microscopic cysts that are dropped by algae blooms and act like seeds for future red tide outbreaks.
Last fall's survey turned up a large number of cysts -- 60 percent more than were observed prior to the huge red tide bloom of 2005 -- indicating a large bloom is likely this spring.
The cyst abundance also appears to have expanded to the south, meaning any outbreak could affect areas such as Massachusetts Bay earlier in the season than in past years, scientists said.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a warning Wednesday about the red tide outlook to give harvesters and aquaculture businesses time to prepare, and restaurants time to make contingency plans for seafood supplies during the summer.
When red tide strikes, clam prices usually go up and retailers and restaurants turn to new suppliers to get product or simply hang out an "Out of Clams" sign, Taylor said.
Restaurants serving fried clam rolls typically buy those clams in the spring and freeze them.
Although the conditions point to widespread red tide, researchers say ocean currents and wind patterns will ultimately determine where it shows up and how long it sticks around.
Onshore winds will drive the red tide toward shore and force clam flats to be closed. But when offshore winds are predominant, the algae tend to stay offshore, far away from harvesting areas.
It's clear that once red tide settles into an area, it tends to stick around for years. But it's not clear why red tide settles into an area in the first place.
"I think that's the $64 million question," said Darcie Couture, who is in charge of red tide monitoring for the Maine Department of Marine Resources.

Discarded drugs frequently taint water supplies

PORTLAND -- The federal government advises throwing most unused or expired medications into the trash instead of down the drain, but they can end up in the water anyway, a study from Maine suggests.
Tiny amounts of discarded drugs have been found in water at three landfills in the state, confirming suspicions that pharmaceuticals thrown into household trash are ending up in water that drains through waste, according to a survey by the state's environmental agency that's one of only a handful to have looked at the presence of drugs in landfills.
That landfill water -- known as leachate -- eventually ends up in rivers. Most of Maine doesn't draw its drinking water from rivers where the leachate ends up, but in other states that do, water supplies that come from rivers could be contaminated.
The results of the survey are being made known as Maine lawmakers consider a bill, among the first of its kind in the nation, that would require drug manufacturers to develop and pay for a program to collect unused prescription and over-the-counter drugs from residents and dispose of them.
Scientists and environmentalists have long known of the common presence of minute concentrations of pharmaceuticals in drinking water, either through human excretion flushed into sewers or leftover medicine thrown down the drain. Research shows that pharmaceuticals sometimes harm fish and other aquatic species, and that human cells can fail to grow normally in the laboratory when exposed to trace concentrations of certain drugs.
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection found tiny amounts -- measured in parts per trillion -- of medications ranging from antidepressants and birth control pills to blood pressure and cholesterol prescriptions. The most prevalent drugs were over-the-counter pain relievers, including ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
"People need a way to properly dispose of their drugs, and they're not getting it right now," said Mark Hyland, director of the state Department of Environmental Quality's Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management.
The bill is one of many "take-back" programs under consideration in more than half a dozen states and would be the first of its kind if enacted. It has won committee support and awaits further action.
The bill is opposed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a Washington-based organization that represents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and has partnered with other groups to pay for advertising against the proposal.
The lobby acknowledges that previous testing shows trace levels of pharmaceuticals can be found in water supplies and landfills, but says the levels are so small that they pose little risk.
"The amounts of pharmaceuticals (in the environment) are infinitesimally small," said Marjorie Powell, senior assistant general counsel. "We're talking about two drops in an Olympic-size swimming pool. Those two drops are much lower than any doses that would have an effect on humans."
The state tested leachate last October at landfills in Augusta, Brunswick and Bath. Hyland ordered up the study after members of the pharmaceutical industry expressed skepticism about the presence of pharmaceuticals in landfill water.
Leachate at Maine landfills typically is piped or trucked to municipal wastewater treatment plants. Those plants are not equipped to remove drugs from the water before it is discharged into rivers and the ocean.
The pharmaceuticals found in the landfills don't pose a direct threat to drinking water, Hyland said. The landfills are lined to protect groundwater supplies, and in Maine there aren't any wastewater plants that treat leachate and discharge into rivers that ultimately supply drinking water.
However, the leachate -- in high enough concentrations -- can pose a threat to fish and shellfish. Research suggests that hormonal drugs, such as birth control pills, tend to feminize fish. If the trend continues, Hyland said, there could be too few male fish to continue reproduction.
"What you find are greater concentrations of females downstream from where they've seen a dose of hormones, so you find a feminization of the fish population where there are fewer males around," he said.
Hyland said he has questions about the effect on commercial seafood -- one of Maine's biggest industries -- in ocean water downstream from the rivers, particularly bivalves such as clams or mussels, which filter water constantly and live near the shore.
"But obviously we need to know a lot more before we can draw a lot of conclusions," Hyland said.
Although landfill leachate doesn't get into drinking water supplies in Maine, it probably does elsewhere, said Andy Tolman, a geologist with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Some scientists urge caution about the dangers of drinking such water over several decades.
"Many larger states have big rivers that are used for both waste disposal and drinking water supplies, places like Ohio and Pennsylvania," Tolman said. "The same river gets used a number of times, and they're very concerned about treatment of sewage and leachate."
Powell, from the pharmaceutical lobby, argued that people can dispose of their drugs properly in their household trash. In Maine, much of the trash is burned, she said, and pollution control experts agree that incinerating unwanted drugs is the safest solution.
She argued that if the bill does pass, it will only make drugs more expensive, she said.
Concerns have grown in recent years about pharmaceuticals reaching drinking water supplies. An Associated Press investigation in 2008 reported that the drinking water of at least 51 million Americans contains minute concentrations of a multitude of drugs.
It's commonly believed that the vast majority of drugs that get into water supplies come from human and animal excretion and that smaller amounts come from flushing them down the toilet or drain, a practice the Food and Drug Administration says is not recommended for most medications.
Federal guidelines recommend using community drug take-back programs to dispose of medications. If those aren't available, people should mix their unwanted drugs with cat litter or some other undesirable substance, put them into a sealed container and put it in the trash, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

WHITEFIELD -- Larry Felt loves to reminisce about the old days when things were hopping over at Kings Mills Union Hall.
For 75 years, people thronged the Town House Road hall from near and far to enjoy the famous annual game, oyster stew, chicken pie and harvest suppers, plus minstrel shows, dances and beano.
The hall was built in 1901 by the Whitefield Fish and Game Club and Whitefield Grange 101. That Grange merged with the Arlington Grange in 1969, and the fish and game club disbanded in 1974. The hall is currently owned by the Kings Mills Union Hall Association.
Members of the association's board of directors not only are committed to restoring the splendor of the 1901 building, but also restoring community.
They are eager to give the hall new life.
Judy Maldovan, president of the board, said the group has held craft fairs, public suppers, children activities and "white elephant" sales on the first floor. She said the upstairs is still off-limits because there is no fire escape.
She said restoration is a slow process. The association raises between $700 and $900 at every public supper, but that isn't enough to bring the building completely up to code. The group also hasn't been successful in securing grants to help pay for repairs.
That hasn't stopped members of the association who are determined to save the hall, however.
"We're continually raising money and checking all the avenues to pay for what needs to be done," she said. "The fire escape is the next big project. We would love to have the upstairs back. It's got a stage. We have the original stage curtain, which is in pretty good shape. We want to preserve that, but our main project is to get the building up to code."
Eighty-nine-year-old Felt, a fifth-generation resident of Whitefield, said his family members were active in the fish and game club, including his grandfather, his sister and his brother-in-law. For many years he was the club's president.
He said there was always something going on at the hall.
"The Grange and fish and game club met there periodically," Felt said. "We ran dances, put on horse shows in the field and held game suppers. We would feed over 300 people at those suppers. We always had a big Fourth of July celebration, and at Christmastime we had a community Christmas tree and the whole town turned out. Of course, people here were a lot closer then than they are now."
At that time, the hall was a center for the community, he said. Kings Mills village, at the south end of town, had two stores, a railroad station -- the narrow gauge railroad passed through Whitefield from Wiscasset -- a garage and a blacksmith.
His grandmother rented out rooms to tourists who came to town for the harvest supper and stayed the weekend.
"I just had a neighbor stop in and we were just discussing this," he said. "I said I wished we could go back to things the way they were, back to the '40s and '50s; but I guess we have to move forward with the times."
Today the hall's metal roof is streaked with rust. Scallop shingles on the back side of the building need to be scraped and painted, and the old brick chimney is covered in moss.
In 1985, the state fire marshal closed the hall. The downstairs was re-opened in 1987 for limited use. Once the foundation was reinforced in 1990, it was safe for the public.
In 2007, the hall was listed on National Register of Historic Places. Maldovan, the board president, said the group must follow certain guidelines when restoring the building. The exterior still needs work and the group is in the process of having the entrance door reproduced.
"Inmates from the Lincoln County pre-release center scraped and painted the downstairs where we hold our public suppers," she said. "It used to be really drab, but it's nice and bright in here now."
The upstairs vaulted ceiling is covered in narrow pine slats that continue down to the floor. The stage has a door that leads to a dressing room.
Some of the glass panes in the old windows are cracked, and the door that once led to the iron fire escape has been barricaded.
Judi Ekholm, who serves on the board, said the roof still needs to be replaced and the upstairs made handicapped-accessible.
"Basically we're working to restore the hall and get it back up to functioning," Ekholm said. "We've been an association for only two years but have been moving forward on these projects. One of the things we've been doing is raising money to have the facades painted."
Katherine Morse takes pride in Kings Mills Union Hall and understands the importance of restoring a town landmark. The retired state worker always helps out at chicken pie suppers, which raise funds to maintain the building.
Morse said her great-grandmother Kate Comeau established and operated a cottage hospital on the Town House Road in the 1930s. The lifelong resident said she was born in that hospital and has fond memories of the hall.
"There was a whole group of us who went to dances there. We learned how to dance at the hall," Morse said. "I grew up going to a one-room school house in the village, it would have been in the 1950s, and we used to go to that hall for hot lunches. They would line us up in twos and march us up there every day to give us lunch."

The red tide that closed clam flats statewide in July was so toxic that it killed more than a dozen sturgeon at the mouth of the Kennebec River, state officials said Friday.
It's believed to be the first time that red tide has killed fish along the Maine coast. And it's the first known case anywhere of the toxin killing shortnose sturgeon, which apparently ate contaminated clams.
The dead fish were found floating near the mouth of the Kennebec in July. At the time, coastal Maine was enduring its most intense red tide outbreak on record. Officials immediately suspected that the sturgeon, which are known to swallow shellfish, had been poisoned.
Federal test results released Friday confirmed high levels of the red tide toxin -- saxitoxin -- in the stomachs and other organs of three fish.
The same laboratory in South Carolina will now test for red tide poisoning in a sampling of about 20 eider ducks that washed ashore dead in Cape Elizabeth around the same time the sturgeon turned up, said Darcie Couture, director of the Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program for the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Couture said she expects those results to be positive for poisoning.
"This was the worst year we've had. This year was just unbelievable," she said.
What worries her most is that it followed a series of other bad years.
"It definitely looks like something tripped and we're in this new environment where we're subject to these incredibly strong" red tide seasons, she said.
Red tide is caused by a type of algae that lives offshore and spreads into coastal waters when conditions are right for summer blooms. No one knows exactly why or when the blooms occur, but winds that push the algae toward the coast and large flows of fresh water from rain appear to be important factors.
Red tide is dangerous to people who eat clams, mussels or other shellfish that ingest the toxic algae. Small doses can cause tingling or numbness, while larger doses can cause deadly paralytic shellfish poisoning.
Maine's clam flats were closed to digging for much of this summer as a precaution, and markets and restaurants had to go elsewhere to find fresh shellfish.
A woman on Swans Island got sick after eating clams she had dug.
She recovered, although officials warned that toxin levels were high enough in some areas to be lethal to humans.
The outbreak was so severe off New England this year that scientists saw patches of reddish brown water, a phenomenon that gives red tide its name but is extremely rare in this part of the world.
Last month, Gov. John Baldacci and Maine's congressional delegation requested federal disaster assistance for the Maine shellfish industry because of the red tide closures during the summer.
Baldacci wrote in his letter that the latest bloom was more severe and more costly than those in 2005 and 2008, both of which were declared disasters.
More than 1,500 Mainers are licensed to harvest shellfish, and the industry generates more than $50 million a year, he wrote.
The death of the sturgeons has introduced a previously unknown threat to the endangered fish, say federal officials. But it's not believed to have threatened Maine's population of shortnose sturgeon, which is concentrated in the Kennebec River.
There were an estimated 9,500 shortnose sturgeon in the Kennebec in 2000, according to Gail Wippelhauser, a biologist with the Department of Marine Resources. Officials now think the population is larger because the fish have shown up in the Penobscot, Presumpscot and Saco rivers in the past few years.
The new test results are a clear reminder of the danger of red tides and the fact that the algal blooms are getting stronger.
State officials and the shellfish industry have kept contaminated shellfish out of the market, which shows that the monitoring system is working, Couture said. But there is still a growing risk to people who collect their own clams and mussels during outbreaks.
"They just have to understand," Couture said, "it's getting worse every year."

Full text: In the eyes of religion, marriage is a sacred covenant created by God.
In the eyes of the state, however, marriage is little more than a word defining certain legal rights, benefits and protections. These include joint tax filing, property inheritance, hospital visitation, and participation in a spouse's health-care benefits.
Can anyone anywhere explain what any of that has to do with what God considers sacred? How does giving two men a "tax credit" detract from the sanctity or blessedness of someone else's covenant?
It all stems from fear, I guess. Fear that granting homosexuals the same legal status as heterosexuals will in some way anger the Creator.
After all, Leviticus 18:22, calls homosexuality an abomination, right? Never mind that, seven chapters earlier, it makes the same case for shellfish. Yet have you ever had a crisis of conscience over a good lobster?
Paul's first letter to the Corinthians says nothing specifically about gay marriage, but clearly states that homosexuals will not enter the kingdom of God.
Of course, he says the same thing about greedy people, drunkards and the verbally abusive. Yet would any of us deny marriage to a Yankees fan, hellbound though they be?
Dress it up however you want, voting "yes" on Question 1 boils down to "hatred." Pure and simple.
But, I don't hate homosexuals, you gasp. I just don't think they should be allowed to get married.
There were people like that during the Civil Rights era, too. They didn't "hate" black people. They just didn't think they should be allowed to drink from the same water fountain.
You may not be chanting racial slurs, and to suggest that another human being isn't as worthy of "x,y,z" as you are, may not be "hate," but it sure ain't love.

Religious leaders split in gay-marriage debate

Religion may be deeply entwined in the gay-marriage debate, but the issue is not as simple as pitting the spiritual on one side against the secular on the other.
Religious leaders are split on same-sex marriage rights. Even some faiths are divided -- one congregation may support same-sex marriage, while another of the same denomination is against it.
Even in the Catholic Church, there are divisions. The Portland diocese's leaders are leading the charge to repeal Maine's new same-sex marriage law, with pastors delivering sermons on the issue and taking up collections to support the cause. But this has spurred protests among some Catholic laity.
Gay marriage -- and related issues, such as whether gays can serve as pastors and priests -- are "really dividing religious communities deeply," said Alan Wolfe, director of Boston College's Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life.
"Like no other issue there is, this touches on everything -- love, devotion, sex, kids, promises," he said. "Most Americans don't have a position on a tariff, it's too foreign them. But they know all about those other things -- it resonates pretty deeply."
Rabbi Carolyn Braun of Temple Beth El in Portland suggested that when societal issues are framed in a religious context, the frame can often appear narrow. But in this case, religious leaders on both sides are out front in the debate.
"God does not have just one voice," said Braun, who supports same-sex marriage rights. "We really want to show that complexity."
But for other clerics, the issue is simple, the message in religious writing is clear.
"It's sort of a no-brainer because of my convictions about my faith and what the Bible has to say about homosexuality," said the Rev. Rich Gustafson, pastor at First Baptist Church in Westbrook, adding that the church "is called to be the conscience of a culture.
"We are to speak out against what we consider to be wrongdoing, sin, evil -- however you want to call it."
The debate's impact on people of faith is being felt across the state.
Last weekend, Bishop Richard Malone, head of the Catholic Church in Maine, had parishes take up a second collection, with funds going to support Stand for Marriage Maine, the political action committee pushing to repeal same-sex marriage. A new group, Catholics for Marriage Equality, urged parishioners against giving to the collection, but instead to put notes into the baskets stating their opposition to the church's stance.
The formation of a group to oppose the bishop's actions would have been unthinkable in the Catholic Church of 10 or 20 years ago. But things have changed, particularly after priest sex-abuse scandals that have affected parishes across the country.
"It's one more wake-up call. We have to make our own voices heard," Underwood said. "The laity need to be more aware, need to speak up. We have to speak out on what we believe is correct, what we believe is right."
Walkout in South Portland
Such divisions aren't new in the gay-marriage debate. Nor are they limited to churches that oppose same-sex marriage rights.
At the First Congregational Church, United Church of Christ, in South Portland, the congregation voted in 2000 to become "open and affirming," welcoming all people regardless of gender, marital status or sexual orientation.
Two years later, the congregation voted to allow its clergy to offer a blessing to same-gender couples. Only 60 percent of the congregation voted in favor of that, and the church lost "25 to 30 wonderful families," said the Rev. John McCall, senior minister at the church.
"People for whom this was the straw that broke the camel's back left. It was painful. Doing things that a person or a community believes is right or just doesn't mean it doesn't hurt," said McCall. "It can hurt like hell when people walk out the door. It hurts the community, it hurts those that leave."
This March, the church's clergy told the congregation that in order to differentiate between church and state, they would no longer sign marriage licenses from the state of Maine. They would continue, however, to give the blessing of the church.
"The state has a certain realm where it is responsible, and religious communities have what I believe should be an entirely different set of criteria and credentials," McCall said.
Scripture used
Not surprisingly, members of the clergy in various churches have different reasons for their positions on gay marriage.
There is a "strong movement in every religious tradition to rethink family, gender and sexuality," said the Rev. Dr. Marvin Ellison, a Presbyterian minister and head of the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to Marry.
"Religion is going to be a factor -- every religious tradition is concerned about the well-being of persons and the character of our community," he continued. "Many of us who are deeply religious believe the best way to support all families is to make available the rights and protections all families and all couples deserve."
Braun, the rabbi, said that for her, the issue boils down to the concept that God made humans in his image. That's where she plans to center her sermon for Rosh Hashana, she said.
"God wouldn't create a being that's no good; I believe that our sexuality is really part of who we are," said Braun.
But the Rev. Bob Emrich of the Emmanuel Bible Baptist Church in Plymouth, a same-sex marriage opponent, also sees it as a "real simple issue."
"The Bible says marriage is the union of a man and a woman," said Emrich, a member of Stand for Marriage Maine's executive committee and a key figure in the fight against same-sex marriage. "This makes it very simple, important to me."
Clergy on each side point to Scripture to make their points. Emrich said the Bible is clear on the definition of marriage in three separate passages.
McCall points out that there are more than 1,000 passages of Scripture. As a culture, we have decided that divorce is all right, slavery is not and it's acceptable to eat shellfish -- though those concepts go against parts of the Bible, he said.
McCall says he sees more in Scripture about justice and inclusion, leading him to support same-sex marriage rights.
Gustafson questioned whether people were allowing Scripture to speak on its own or coming to it with preconceived notions, "getting it to say what we want it to say." And that speaks to what he believed religion's role was in society, Gustafson said.
"The question is, are we influencing culture, or is culture influencing us?" he said. Marc Mutty, director of Stand for Marriage Maine, said the acceptance of same-sex marriage by mainline churches is a new phenomenon.
"I think it's an accommodation that's being made to what's politically correct," he said. It can be hard for people to debate the value or lack of value in someone else's religious thinking, Emrich acknowledged.
"We all have to grow a little bit of thick skin," he said.
There is at least one certainty: After the vote in November, there will still be religion in Maine. And it will have roles to play in society.
"Regardless of the outcome, there are going to be people who will be struggling and pained by the outcome," said Ellison. "I think every religious community needs to be aware and caring about everyone -- but especially about those who experience the outcome as defeat."
Gustafson said he hopes the entire same-sex marriage debate and vote will serve as a wake-up call to Christians.
"We can't be on the sidelines any more," he said. "We need to be out there in showing that the Gospel addresses these matters. I don't just want to be against things, I want to be for things -- (fighting) poverty, problems with youth, problems with divorce -- things affecting our culture. I pray this would be a wake-up call."

HANCOCK -- The influx of shellfish harvesters from other parts of Maine have some residents and others seeing red about how it is affecting clam flats in the upper Frenchman Bay.
Because a red tide outbreak has forced the closure of most bivalve shellfish harvesting areas throughout the state, some diggers farther south and from Washington County have been coming to Hancock County to ply their trade. The result, according to about 30 people who gathered Tuesday at the Town Office, is too many harvesters crowding into too small an area.
"[Area flats are] being raked by everyone from Portland to Calais," Steve Beathem, an Ellsworth city councilor and clam buyer for Maine Shellfish Co., told the group. "What they are doing is raking your future. You guys need to take action."
The state requires that towns adopting shellfish harvesting ordinances must include conservation measures and must enforce their ordinances, which means hiring someone to make sure local rules are being followed.
, according to Nault. Interested towns do not have to form shellfish associations exactly like the one in Knox County, he said, but by banding together they can pool their resources to hire someone to enforce local shellfish harvesting laws, he said.
Nault said he encourages shellfish harvesters and towns to adopt ordinances to manage their clam flats. He said that he and his small staff may know about the biology of bivalves, but it is the diggers who know the most about their digging areas.
"Local control, I feel, on a shellfish resource is best," Nault said. "We provide the science. They have that local knowledge."
Nault said clams harvested in the six Hancock County towns have a total average annual value of nearly $374,000, which is similar to the annual value of clams dug in towns with high tidal flat acreage such as Scarborough and Lubec. He said he would try to help advise diggers in the six Hancock County towns on how their towns can adopt local restrictions and manage their harvesting areas, perhaps as a group.
Charles Brown, a digger from Trenton, said Tuesday outside the Hancock town office that he and his fellow harvesters from the area plan to approach officials in each town to get support for adopting local restrictions of some sort. Protecting clam flats is not just good for harvesters, he said, it also is good for businesses where harvesters spend their money.
"Nothing like this ever happens overnight," Brown said. "We know we're not going to close down [area flats to outside diggers] this year, but next year we can."

TURNER -- Maxine Hinkley tugged open two drawers she'd never opened before and gasped.
Stacks of bird bodies piled one on top of another. Feathers as fluffy as the day they dropped out of the sky a century ago.
And around each ankle, a little ID tag: Pine Siskin, 1892. Bay-breasted warbler, 1890.
The unexpected drawer of birds joined a dozen-plus stuffed animals displayed around the room. And a pine cone collection. A bird nest collection. A snake and snakeskin collection. A dirt collection in carefully labeled glass bottles, one with Dust Bowl dust.
"People collected everything in those days and thank God they did," said Hinkley, president of the Turner Natural History Club Museum.
The little rural club's seashells are considered so extraordinary the American Museum of Natural History in New York City swung by to borrow 900 in 1997. The curator of zoology at the Maine State Museum calls it a "phenomenal resource," maybe unique in Maine today.
Yet Hinkley's pretty sure that for the last two decades nearly no one knew what, or where, it was.
"Museum" was just recently added to the name, along with a new sign, phone number and e-mail. In a real sense, the place is dusting itself off.
Their club dates to 1920, when members met once a month to listen to music, read poetry and show off collections comprised of things that cost little or no money. Hence dirt. Empty turtle shells. Neat jars stickered "Corn Products" from someone who apparently raided an old-time cereal cupboard ("Corn Kix," "Shredded Ralston").
Back in the day, it all made for a fun evening out. Membership swelled to 100, Hinkley said.
"Imagine the work people put into this," she said. "It was their hobby; it was their thing to do. They didn't sit around watching TV -- there was no TV."
Through an all-volunteer effort, they built the shallow white cape on 442 Turner Center Road as a clubhouse in 1930. Almost every room is lined with shelves or glass bookcases and taken up by something. As members died, they left the club intricate wood displays and hand-numbered envelopes stuffed with moss and lichen. Hundreds of rocks. Even a stuffed white baby seal.
The largest reserve is the seashells: Hinkley estimates the club has 50,000. Wing and pearl oysters. Tellins. Tun and fig shells. Janthina snails. Cowries.
A letter from the American Museum of Natural History that thanked the club for an indefinite loan of specimens like Hawaiian land snails said they would "greatly assist scientists around the world who frequently borrow such material for scientific research and education."
The labels and attention to detail give the club a "time capsule feel," said Paula Work at the Maine State Museum, who's driven out to visit. It's also a boon to those looking at issues like climate change.
"I was thrilled on two levels. One, that the center exists," she said. Second, that through a new grant to survey science collections around the state, she'll be able to offer some help.
"Those little 'aha' moments that are stored in drawers together, collectively, make these a phenomenal resource," Work said.
Today the club is at 14 members and doesn't meet monthly to read poetry and show off collections as much as to plan the future for the collections they've got, Hinkley said.
She's been president since February. Her husband, Homer, has been a member for 50 years. She plans to ask the town for help going forward with operating costs. This fall, she'll pursue grants. Next spring, she'd like to write its history.
On the group's to-do list is preserving the largely pristine stuffed specimens: Barred owls. Louisiana water thrush. A pair of yellow and green budgerigars, parakeet look-alikes that look like they could come to life.
How'd they fare so well over the decades left in the open air, in an unheated clubhouse?
Maine temperatures helped, Work said. Without much activity in the building, there wasn't much dust kicked up. And, it turns out, the liberal use of taxidermy poison provided an assist.
"Those birds are laden with arsenic, so they've become unpalatable to the insect world," Work said.

AUGUSTA -- Local legislators say they not only helped shape state policy this session, but had a significant effect on the lives of people in central Maine.
From renaming a bridge in Augusta to passing a new law to help people facing foreclosure, local lawmakers worked on the state General Fund and transportation budgets, tax and energy policy, and labor bills.
Depending on political persuasion, the results are regarded as positive by some and negative by others.
Borrowing a page from U.S. Rep. Tip O'Neill, who coined the phrase "all politics is local," the Kennebec Journal asked 10 lawmakers a single question: What legislation will most affect the people of central Maine? Below, you'll find their answers.
Rep. Patsy Crockett, D-Augusta
House District 57: part of Augusta
Crockett sponsored measures to rename the Father John J. Curran Bridge, create a memorial for murdered children and put a new law on the books to address motor vehicle accidents when a traffic violation results in death.
Last year, victims of childhood sexual abuse approached the city of Augusta and the state to try to get the Curran Bridge in downtown renamed. Curran, a Catholic priest who died in 1976, was accused posthumously of sexually abusing children.
A committee suggested the name Calumet Bridge at Old Fort Western, which was approved by lawmakers.
A member of the Taxation Committee, Crockett also worked on the tax overhaul that lowered the income tax, increased the meals and lodging tax and applied the state sales tax to new items.
"I am so pleased with tax reform, I can't tell you," she said.
Crockett also sponsored a new law to require signs to warn motorcyclists of rumble strips on certain roads and to allow fraternal organizations to add more players to Texas Hold 'Em games.
Sen. David Trahan, R-Waldboro
Senate District 20: Windsor, Washington, Friendship, Jefferson, Whitefield and other Lincoln County towns
Trahan said those who like to fish for smelt on the Kennebec River will notice a new federal saltwater fishing registry in January because the Legislature did not take action to put in place its own program.
Trahan sponsored a bill to allow the state to set up its own system, but the bill got sent back to committee.
He also said people who live in his district will notice major tax changes put in place by Democrats. The overhaul lowers the income tax but applies the sales tax to other items and raises the meals and lodging tax.
"It went through so quickly I don't think people know what it's going to do later on," he said.
On a positive note, Trahan co-sponsored a bill that funded three positions in the Department of Marine Resources to improve the state's shellfish monitoring program.
Rep. Lisa Miller, D-Somerville
House District 52: Chelsea, Washington, Somerville, Whitefield, part of Jefferson, Hibberts Gore
Miller, who serves on the Appropriations Committee, spent most of her time this session working on the state budget. The committee meets at least monthly throughout the off season and will be busy trying to cut an additional money from next year's budget.
"People want smaller government," she said. "When people get it, they don't always like it."
She also worked on a bill to create a citizen review panel to investigate police involved shooting deaths. The bill as proposed did not pass, but there will now be new requirements on local police departments when they investigate shootings.
MIller continued to work on legislation that will require students to spend more time exercising while at school, and she supported the tax reform plan.
Rep. Bill Browne, R-Vassalboro
House District 58: part of Augusta, Vassalboro, Windsor
Browne, who also serves as a member of the Vassalboro Budget Committee, said local towns will feel the effects of state budget cuts that reduced funding to municipalities, tax relief programs and for road repairs.
A member of the Legislature's Transportation Committee, Browne said he anticipates coming back over the summer to work on the highway budget. Lawmakers were unable to agree on a funding source for road paving.
"It's going to affect us if we don't get the paving done," he said.
Overall, the session had a positive tone, he said.
"I thought the leaders did a good job in the House and Senate under these trying times," he said.
Rep. Anna Blodgett, D-Augusta
House District 56: part of Augusta
Blodgett, a freshman legislator, said she feels badly for state workers who saw pay and benefits cut as part of balancing the state budget.
"It impacted this area so much more than anywhere else," she said.
Blodgett said she also supported efforts to reduce the size of the House and sponsored a bill to control gun sales. Both failed to pass.
As a member of the Labor Committee, Blodgett said she was glad to see a bill that allows workers to discuss their salaries gain final passage. She said she supported the bill to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry in Maine and that she thinks the tax changes will be beneficial "to just about everybody."
She said she's concerned that there's not enough funding for road work, which is something that will have to be addressed again soon.
Sen. Earle McCormick, R-West Gardiner
Senate District 21: Chelsea, Farmingdale, Gardiner, Hallowell, Litchfield, Manchester, Monmouth, Pittston, Randolph, West Gardiner, Winthrop
McCormick said the state budget, which cut pay and benefits for state workers, will have an impact on many of his constituents.
He also named new funding to pay for the expansion of the Kennebec County Courthouse, and money included in future borrowing packages, as items that will have an effect in this region.
The state made major payments to settle old hospital debt this year, which will help local hospitals, he said.
"We got through stimulus money that paid hospitals a significant amount that stabilizes the hospitals and the people employed by them for a while," he said.
McCormick said lawmakers will have to revisit the highway budget, which did not provide adequate funding for road maintenance.
Sen. Elizabeth Mitchell, D-Vassalboro
Senate District 24: Augusta, China, Oakland, Sidney, Vassalboro
Mitchell led the effort to secure funding to renovate the Kennebec County Courthouse, a project expected to get under way in the next two years. The money will be used to make the courthouse handicapped accessible, to consolidate court services and modernize the system, she said.
"That's a very positive thing for central Maine," she said.
Mitchell also sponsored a bill to make sure that benefits earned by state retirees and teachers won't go down if the Consumer Price Index drops. And, although state workers took cuts in pay and benefits, she said lawmakers were able to avoid additional layoffs.
As part of the health care changes offered to state workers, they will have the chance to earn back some of the money they will be required to pay if they participate in a wellness program.
Mitchell said that puts the state on even footing with private companies who have instituted similar programs in recent years.
Rep. Gary Knight, R-Livermore Falls
House District 81: Wayne, Leeds, Livermore and Livermore Falls
Knight said he played an active role in promoting a bill that would delay penalties for school districts that have not yet consolidated.
He also worked on bills that ban smoking on state park beaches and in outdoor eating areas.
Knight, a member of the Taxation Committee, said he ultimately could not support the major tax overhaul because it did not go far enough in providing tax relief for Maine citizens.
"At the end of the day, I voted against it, myself, because it fell so far short," he said.
Knight said Republicans played a key role in keeping the bond package to $150 million, an amount he described as fiscally responsible.
He said he was disappointed that a bill he sponsored to exempt severance pay at Wausau Paper from taxation died because it did not get funded.
Rep. Sharon Treat, D-Hallowell
House District 79: Farmingdale, Hallowell and West Gardiner
Treat worked to pass a new law that will set up a program to help people going through the foreclosure process stay in their homes.
"Hopefully, if it works, there's going to be outreach to people so before they get too far behind, they get help from people who aren't trying to scam them," she said.
She said a new law that will continue to fund Dirigo Health will keep health insurance in place for many people and small businesses that rely on the program. Treat sponsored a health care bill of rights that will require insurance companies to disclose more information to consumers.
The big energy bill that includes state and federal money to help people weatherize their homes will also help many in central Maine, she said.
"It's real assistance to people," she said.
Rep. Patrick Flood, R-Winthrop
House District 82: Readfield, Winthrop
Flood said the $150 million bond package includes money for waste-water improvements, an important, but unseen benefit for central Maine. Next June, voters will be asked to approve more than $5 million in state money for waste-water improvements, which would be matched by federal funds, Flood said.
He said individual families need to calculate how the tax reform package will affect them.
A member of the Appropriations Committee, Flood said there's difficult work ahead to trim the budget.
The committee was originally scheduled to cut an additional $30 million from the budget, but that number grew to $50 million when revenues came in lower than expected. Flood said that could grow again.
"We'll probably have $70 million or so to eke out of the biennial budget and present our findings to the Legislature when they come back in January," he said. "It could be quite significant."

WATERVILLE -- It was the late 1970s. Eric Bloom and his band, Blue Öyster Cult, were on a small private plane flying to a show in Maine.
"We got knocked all over the place," Bloom said in a telephone interview Wednesday. "It felt like we were going up 1,000 feet and then down 2,000 -- in five seconds."
By the time the plane got below the storm clouds, Bangor International Airport had had its power knocked out. The plane had to swing around and land in Portland.
"It was the worst storm; the worst flight. It was pretty miserable," said Bloom, lead vocalist who plays rhythm guitar and keyboard.
Blue Öyster Cult arrives in Waterville Saturday night to play a show at Champions Fitness Club at Elm Plaza.
The rock legends will be driving to Waterville, Bloom said.
The show will be the band's eighth of a 2009 tour that began June 3.
Saturday's show at Champions will be held at the fitness club's tennis court, with capacity for 800 to 1,000 people. Bloom said he's looking forward to the show.
"I would prefer to play Shea Stadium," Bloom said, tongue-in-cheek. "I'm glad to play Waterville and party all night long."
What can concert-goers expect to hear?
"I write a different set every day; it depends on what kind of show it is," Bloom said. "The obvious will be there. It's the other songs ... depends on how long we get to play."
The "obvious" choices will certainly include "(Don't Fear) The Reaper," "Burnin' For You," "Cities on Flame" and "Godzilla."
Bloom said the band did play a "fan's show" in New Jersey this past winter and played its longest set ever -- 27 songs over nearly 31/2 hours -- and the above songs were left out.
"We rehearsed and learned a few (songs) they never heard us play before," Bloom said. "You do have to relearn them."
The band continues to tour year after year; its last studio album, "Curse of the Hidden Mirror," was released eight years ago.
Bloom said the band doesn't have a record label and producing a new album is not in the cards because it's too difficult with the downward spike in the music industry, caused largely by digital downloads, he said.
Other than his own band's work, what is Bloom listening to these days? Lykke Li, for one; she's an alternative, gritty Swedish pop singer with an independent label, Bloom said. Disturbed and Slipknot are among his favorite modern hard-rock favorites.
Bloom said the band sees a wide variety of ages at shows, even though the height of their popularity was during the '70s and '80s. Bloom said he's seen entire families at shows.
Indeed, many fans are young people, Bloom said.
"More cowbell" may have something to do with that, he admits.
The popular catchphrase comes from an April 8, 2000, comedy sketch from "Saturday Night Live" that spoofs a VH1 documentary of Blue Öyster Cult in 1976 performing their most famous song, "(Don't Fear) The Reaper."
Actor Christopher Walken plays famed producer Bruce Dickinson. Walken interrupts the band's rehearsal several times and implores fictional cowbell player Gene Frenkle, played by Will Ferrell, to deliver "more cowbell" during the song.
"I gotta have more cowbell," Walken says memorably. "I got a fever; the only prescription is more cowbell."
The skit -- and the "more cowbell" line -- became notorious and continues to stick with Walken, Ferrell and, of course, Blue Öyster Cult.
Bloom remembers watching the skit live on TV that night.
"My jaw dropped," Bloom said.
But Bloom isn't bitter; he's thankful. "The cowbell sketch has been terrific for me. It's raised our visibility," he said.

Bible's moral laws stand firm, including marriage

Full text: In her May 30 column, Rev. Susan Reisert asserts that the Bible does not provide a stable, authoritative mandate on marriage -- nothing could be further from the truth.
Quoting Jesus: "At the beginning, God made them male and female and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate." Matthew 19:4-6.
Anyone who claims to be a Christian and takes the Bible seriously is on dangerous ground when they use narrative examples of polygamy, fornication, etc. as proof to support sinful moralities. The Bible also recounts incidents of murder, theft, lying, adultery. Would you also claim that those are acceptable because they are "in the Bible?"
Such foolishness seems to be the hallmark of our day, when good is called evil and evil is called good.
An equally maddening mindset among Bible critics is the idea that Christians are hypocrites if they don't adhere to all the Jewish laws in the Old Testament (such as abstaining from shellfish). While there are many Jewish civil laws our country would do well to observe, the ceremonial laws (regarding kosher food, hairstyles, circumcision) were peculiar to the Jews, to mark them as God's special people. The moral laws (do not murder, steal, lie) stand firm, including God's definition for marriage -- anything less isn't intellectually honest.

LD 1399 not just another 'toilet tax' for Maine

Full text: Some describe the bill by Sen. David Trahan, R-Lincoln, and Rep. Dianne Tilton, R-Harrington, "An Act Concerning Water Quality in Watersheds -- LD 1399" as nothing more than a toilet tax. I respectfully disagree.
LD 1399 was born to ensure that the state's shellfish industry can continue to provide jobs for our families, friends and neighbors. The shellfish industry contributes $60 million per year into the state economy. Without it, Maine would not be Maine -- the place we all know and cherish.
The bill also addresses the need to create a source of funding for infrastructure improvements and repairs at public sewer plants, septic system replacements, overboard discharge removals and pollution identification and abatement throughout the state. LD 1399 was worked on by all stakeholders -- the shellfish industry, the Maine Waste Water Control Association, the governor's office, legislators, and state departments of environmental protection and marine resources.
While none of the stakeholders wishes to see increased fees of any kind, the surcharges proposed in LD 1399 are small and targeted at the core of the problem: sewage seeping into our waters -- both via public and private systems.
Most everyone would agree that the responsibility to protect our rivers, lakes, streams and shores from pollution belongs to all Mainers. LD 1399 asks every resident to chip in to ensure that folks continue to flock to Maine in search of pristine waterways and clean beaches.

Full text: Pick-and-Choose Christians are out in full force nowadays in Maine. For those unfamiliar with the term, Pick-and-Choose Christians (P&Cs) presume to judge the worth of the Bible by vowing to protect some parts of it with every last fiber of their being while blatantly disregarding other parts entirely.
My favorite mental image of P&Cs is of those driving around town talking about "them homos."
You can just hear it: "I deplore them ... they're disgusting and unacceptable ... they're ramming gay marriage down our throats ..."(Please note these are phrases I pulled from past letters to the editor in case you think I just make this stuff up).
And even as they speak, they proudly flaunt the lobster license plates on the front and back of their cars. Leviticus 11:10-12, people! What's the penalty for ramming that unclean lobster down God's throat?
Now the P&Cs reading this letter are scolding me "... another wacko bringing up the shellfish again ... doesn't he know that's not important ... someone needs to tell him that stuff in the Bible about shellfish and locking away your unclean wife during her period just isn't important any more ... after all, it's only there because when it was written that stuff was thought to be dangerous to the community, but everyone knows it isn't true any more ..."
Hmmmm ...

Some people struggle to pick a career, let alone "find their calling."
For Alexandra Desaulniers, of Rockland, she's known her career path for most of her life.
"Since the age of eight, I have known that I want to be president of the United States," she said. "During a tour of the White House, I gazed up in awe at each president's portrait. But I also wondered, 'Where are all the women?'
"I was shocked when my mother told me that there had never been a woman president. And so my determination was sparked to become the very first."
Now 20, Desaulniers is a sophomore at Colby College in Waterville and will be featured in a book, "She's Out There: Essays by 35 Young Women Who Aspire to Lead the Nation: The Next Generation of Presidential Candidates." Edited by Amy Sewell and Heather L. Ogilvie, the book hits stands May 12.
Desaulniers heard about the call for essays through The White House Project, a non-profit organization working to advance women in business, politics and media. The contest asked for girls and women to write about what their presidential platforms would be.
Desaulniers' essay reflects her support of government policies that help small business. Her passion for small business began when she was 11 and her father, a science teacher, began a 12 feet by 12 feet oyster farm on an estuary as a school marine biology project. The family decided the farm had potential and invested in its growth. Today the family has more than a million oysters -- some smaller than pinky, others up to three inches, the size they are harvested.
The oysters are appealing because they pump and clean 60 gallons of water a day. They aren't just a source of sea food, Desaulniers said -- raising oysters is an environmentally friendly business and is an efficient way of cleaning the estuary's waters.
"As a member of a small family aquaculture business, I have felt firsthand the impact of local, state and federal policy on small business -- the backbone of much of the nation's economy," Desaulniers said in her essay.
Her essay was one of 35 submissions accepted from a pool of more than 200 papers. Editors Sewell and Ogilvie chose 35 essays because 35 is the minimum age for becoming president.
Besides Desaulniers' ideas regarding small businesses, many of the essayists wrote about issues discussed in the 2008 presidential campaign, including the Iraq war, health care, education, immigration and the environment. Women's issues came up often and several young girls mentioned the circumstances of the 2000 Bush-Gore election as an impressionable time on their interest in politics, Ogilvie said.
"We judged them based on how serious and passionate the writers are about politics, and how well they communicate their ideas," Ogilvie said. "The best essayists link their political ambition to their personal experiences, have unique ideas for solving problems our country is facing, or intend to take unique paths to reach their political goals."
Desaulniers' experiences, along with what she's learned as an Anthropology and theater double major, is the foundation of what she hopes will be an industrious service record.
"Politics need to be about the people; starting from small towns to federal, we need to have a local feel," she said.

Flame-retardant chemicals banned in Maine because of emerging public health fears have shown up in sediment or shellfish in all U.S. coastal waters, including in mussels collected along the Maine coast, according to a new federal report.
Maine was among the first states to restrict the sale of consumer products containing polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs, over the past five years. The compounds now are banned or are being phased out in many parts of the world amid growing evidence that they are building up in the environment.
Laboratory tests have shown them to be toxic to animals.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, released a report Wednesday saying that PBDEs have spread to all U.S. coastal waters from only a limited number of areas a decade earlier. Levels of contamination are highest around urban areas such as New York and Los Angeles, but the chemicals also are present in remote and relatively pristine areas, including along the coasts of Maine and Alaska.
"This is a wake-up call for Americans concerned about the health of our coastal waters and their personal health," John H. Dunnigan, NOAA assistant administrator of the National Ocean Service, said in the agency's written announcement. "Scientific evidence strongly documents that these contaminants impact the food web, and action is needed to reduce the threats posed to aquatic resources and human health."
Mussels collected from three sites along the Maine coast -- Kennebunkport, Harpswell and Sears Island -- contained low to medium levels of the chemicals, according to NOAA.
However, experts stressed that the presence of the chemicals does not mean that shellfish are unsafe to eat.
PBDEs also have been found in other foods, including fatty meats and dairy products, and in household dust, which is believed to be the biggest source of exposure for people.
Scientists also are not exactly sure yet what effects, if any, the chemicals might be having on humans, or how much exposure could cause health problems.
"I certainly wouldn't, on the basis of this data, get alarmed about people eating mussels or eating shellfish. The stuff is all over our houses and in all the other foods you eat," said Deborah Rice, a Maine state toxicologist who has studied the health effects of PBDEs.
"We already know that they're in the food supply," agreed Michael Belliveau, executive director of the Bangor-based Environmental Health Strategy Center. "It's one additional piece of evidence that the food web has been badly contaminated by these chemicals."
NOAA looked at sediments and shellfish because both tend to capture whatever contaminants are in the water. Samples collected in 1996 showed the presence of PBDEs in a small number of areas, while samples collected in 2006 showed the chemicals virtually everywhere.
The NOAA study was the first to look at coastal waters. Studies in Maine and elsewhere have found the chemicals in human blood and breast milk, dust, wild bird eggs and seal blubber, among other things.
PBDEs are long-lasting, man-made toxic chemicals that have been used since the 1970s as flame retardants in a variety of consumer products, including building materials, electronics, furnishings, motor vehicles, plastics, polyurethane foams and textiles.
A growing body of research points to evidence that exposure to PBDEs might cause damaging health effects, according to NOAA and other scientists. Studies indicate that liver, thyroid and neurobehavioral development could be harmed by exposure to PBDEs, and that babies, who can ingest the chemicals in breast milk or in household dust, are most susceptible.
Representatives for a group of companies that make the chemicals could not be reached. The trade group Bromine Science and Environmental Forum opposed recent restrictions in Maine and elsewhere by arguing that some common forms of the chemicals do not last in the environment as long as others, and that there was still no proof that low levels of exposure present a health threat.
Belliveau, of the Environmental Health Strategy Center, said the report shows that Maine was right to lead other states with restrictions on the chemicals. He also said it shows the need for stronger federal regulation of toxic chemicals.
"We have a broken federal safety system that allows untested and known toxic chemicals to be widely used in commerce and dispersed in the environment and in our homes and in our bodies," he said.
Maine and others states also need to do even more, he said.
"Maine has done what it can to ban new uses of the chemicals." But, he said, "there's a huge reservoir of these chemicals in old products."
Bellieveau said state officials have begun talking about a program to collect and dispose of old furniture and other products containing PBDEs. Although difficult, he said, it would be easier than trying to avoid exposure through foods or household dust.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- Canoeists and kayakers would be required to pay a $19-a-year license fee to use inland waters under a bill that will get a public hearing next week.
Rep. Jane Eberle, D-South Portland, is the sponsor of LD 626, which requires anyone older than 16 who uses a non-motorized watercraft to get a license. Those who already have a hunting, fishing or trapping license are exempt.
The idea is to get so-called "nonconsumptive users" to contribute to the Maine Endangered and Nongame Wildlife Fund.
The license would be called a "Wildlife Enthusiast's Conservation Appreciation, Recreation and Enjoyment" license or WE CARE, according to the bill.
Violators could be fined anywhere from $100 to $500.
Similar bills have been killed in the past, but groups such as The Nature Conservancy are backing the effort this time around.
The hearing will be held at 1 p.m. Tuesday in room 206 of the Cross State Office Building.
The great button debate
Senate President Elizabeth Mitchell, D-Vassalboro, reminded her Senate colleagues this week about decorum in the chamber.
While senators may wear small lapel pins of donkeys or elephants, depending on their particular persuasion, they are not supposed to wear other types of political buttons.
Sen. Dennis Damon, D-Trenton, who is sponsoring a bill to allow gay marriage in Maine, had worn a pin that said "It's about love."
Someone took offense, which led Mitchell to ask senators to talk to each other, or directly to her, if they have an issue with what someone is wearing.
"I don't want to be the button police," she said, noting that she has trouble seeing buttons from her perch at the rostrum. "Let's make sure we stay on the high level."
Mark your calendar
Speaking of the gay marriage bill, House Speaker Hannah Pingree, D-North Haven, said this week that a date for the public hearing has been set.
It's scheduled for April 24 at Cony High School. Lawmakers are anticipating a large crowd but could not get a room at the Augusta Civic Center, so they chose Cony instead, she said. It's school vacation week, so the school is available for use.
The bill is being circulated for signatures and could be printed as soon as next week.
GOP and shellfish flats
Sen. David Trahan, R-Waldoboro, and Rep. Dianne Tilton, R-Harrington, are working to drum up support for a $2 million bond issue for river cleanup that would help those who make a living from harvesting clams, mussels, oysters and quahogs.
The fund would be replenished by a $2 annual assessment on public sewer bills, according to the House Minority Office.
"The problem is that runoff from farms and storm-flooded sewer systems forces state regulators to close the flats for long periods of time," Harrington said in a statement. "That presents a real hardship for Maine families who depend on shellfish harvesting for their livelihoods."
Blodgett takes on gun issue
Rep. Anna Blodgett, D-Augusta, just a few months into her first legislative session, is taking on a big issue: background checks at gun shows.
Blodgett is sponsoring LD 814, which would require anyone selling weapons at gun shows to do an instant background check.
Apparently, federal law requires licensed firearm dealers who sell at retail stores to do background checks, but those who sell at gun shows don't have to, according to the House Majority Office.
"This is a matter of fairness," Blodgett said in a statement. "We cannot hold licensed gun dealers to one standard and sellers at gun shows to another. If there is a standard in place, it should apply to everybody."
Similar bills have been defeated in the last two legislative sessions.
The Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee will hold a public hearing on the bill in the coming weeks.
Fete for Mitchell
A group of Augusta-area officials and businesspeople recently threw a party for Senate President Elizabeth Mitchell, D-Vassalboro, complete with a song recorded in her honor.
Local businessman Roger Pomerleau, who sings under the name Valentine Green, recorded a song called "She's the One."
It tells the story about Mitchell's decision to move to Maine with her husband and her decision to stay.
"To the Kennebec Valley people, she's a hero to us all, protecting the powerless and standing mighty tall," are some of the lyrics, written by Harry King.
Mitchell said she had a great time.
"I have never had more fun," she said. "What an honor. I said, 'I hope you still like me at the end of the session.'"
Milk prices 101
Anyone who's been around the Statehouse for a while knows there are few things more confusing than milk prices.
Explaining Dirigo Health, Medicaid noncategoricals (childless adults), and tax reform pale in comparison.
Sen. John Nutting, D-Leeds, a dairy farmer himself, asked Agriculture Commissioner Seth Bradstreet this week to make sure he provided the committee with an easy way to explain milk prices to members of the Appropriations Committee.
His response?
"It's confusing as mud and that's the milk pricing as we know it," Bradstreet said.
Public hearings
The major event at the Statehouse next week is the governor's State of the State address, set for 7 p.m. Tuesday.
Legislative committees will have a busy week, with public hearings on motorcycle helmets, wind energy rebates and a host of bond proposals.

The UMaine report is available online at http://www.climatechange.umaine.edu/mainesclimatefuture.
Portland Press Herald
AUGUSTA -- Maine's forests, rivers and coastal waters -- and the communities and industries that rely on them -- all face major changes in the coming decades because of a warming climate, according to a University of Maine report released Wednesday.
Maine already is warmer than 30 years ago, with warmer coastal waters and earlier spring thaws, among other things, according to the report. And a much warmer and wetter climate is now unavoidable because of past emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, according to the study.
"It's a very complex and urgent problem that we have to deal with globally," said George Jacobson, a professor emeritus and a lead author of the report.
But, he said, "there is no way we can prevent the climate from changing a lot. We need to adapt."
Gov. John Baldacci asked the university to prepare a statewide assessment about a year ago, and a team of researchers from the university's Climate Change Institute presented the report to him Wednesday morning.
"It's a very sobering report," Baldacci said.
The report is the most ambitious effort yet to apply climate change projections to Maine's environment and economy, and it identifies a range of challenges, as well as some opportunities. It says, for example:
* Forests are expected to have fewer spruce and fir trees and more oaks and maples.
* Species such as loons, chickadees, lynx and moose could gradually be replaced by bobcat, deer and other southern species.
* Warmer ocean waters, together with higher acidity, could affect the health of lobsters and other shellfish, while southern flounder may become more common.
* Maine's tourism industry should prepare for rising sea levels that could threaten coastal areas, as well as shorter and wetter snow seasons and longer spring and fall seasons.
Baldacci said Maine will continue to lead efforts to slow global warming and minimize its impacts. But, he said, the report will help the state prepare and adapt.
"The effects of past emissions are already here and will continue to grow," Baldacci said. "This report is going to be one of the things that we want to constantly keep in front of us."
Baldacci said the report could be immediately useful to members of a task force that may soon explore adaptation strategies for the state. A bill to create the group is scheduled to be presented to a legislative committee next Tuesday.
More than 75 Maine researchers contributed to the report released Wednesday. Leaders of the effort said they plan to follow up with new studies focusing on climate change in Maine.
The report projects a 3- to 10-degree increase in average annual temperature over the next century and an increase in rainfall as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere gradually change Maine's climate. Those are considered middle-of-the-road projections and assume that global action is taken soon to reduce global warming pollution, according to Jacobson.
"This is not a worst-case scenario by any means," Jacobson said.
(The report is online at http://www.climatechange.umaine.edu/mainesclimatefuture.)
Among the projected effects, scientists say, a warmer and wetter climate will mean shifts in the plants and animals that live in Maine and coastal waters, including many that are commercially valuable. "The changes are significant enough that all of the species that live in Maine will be affected," Jacobson said.
Those changes will bring both challenges and opportunities, he said. For example, the spruce and fir trees that have fed the state's pulp and paper industry are expected gradually to be replaced by maple and oak trees.
"There may be opportunities for different kinds of forest products," Jacobson said.
Charles Colgan, a contributor to the report, said there clearly will be costs, such as rising sea levels and shifting river flows that threaten coastal communities and tourism.
"A lot of our economy is exposed to sea level rise and river flooding," he said. "The cost of being in risky places is going to go up."
But he also agreed there will be economic opportunities for Maine.
"I think when we get past the current (economic) crisis, the question is going to be: 'What's going to drive the economy in the next decade?'" he said. "And the answer has got to be, figure out how to fix these problems and make money doing it."
Paul Mayewski, director of the university's Climate Change Institute, said the report represents the state of the art of climate science.
While the overall global warming trend remains clear, scientists continue to learn new things about the rate of climate change and how it will affect different regions and environments, he said. The team of Maine scientists plans to build on the report with more regional studies that could help the state prepare and respond, he said.
"We will have no choice but begin to think more and more of these things," he said.
Mayewski said Maine, because of its natural resources, is in a good position to adapt and to take advantage of the economic opportunities such as developing wind power and other renewable energy. "We couldn't be in a better place," he said.
Jonathan Reisman, associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of Maine at Machias, was not a part of the research team and has been a more skeptical voice in the debate over Maine climate change policy.
He said he could not argue with the science, but praised the authors for acknowledging that there is still much to learn about climate science and how it will affect Maine.
"This is at best a guess, albeit an educated one," he said.
And, he said, he wishes the state would also take a hard look at the costs of addressing climate change before promoting alternative energy sources and other opportunities. While that may enrich some, he said, it will mean lower standards of living and less opportunity for most Mainers.

Full text: Staff Writer
VASSALBORO -- On Tuesday morning, a small sign hung in front of the log cabin-style building, listing the hours: 6 a.m.-6 p.m.
The outside windows were covered with promotional posters for New England Coffee. Up the entrance ramp to the front door, another sign: "Over 18 only" -- and another at the door: "No cameras, no touching, cash only." A man in a white dress shirt kept watch at the front door.
Inside, two men sipped coffee at their booth; the rest of the tables were empty. There are 15 tables, with room enough for 58 people.
On Tuesday, inside were three topless women, one topless man and owner Donald Crabtree in a dress shirt and tie. Blue Oyster Cult's "Don't Fear the Reaper" was playing.
Brothers Dick and Rene Brochu of Augusta, ages 60 and 59, said they decided to stop by the Grand View Topless Coffee Shop after hearing about it from friends. Both men are retired.
"I really hope it works," Dick Brochu said of the business. "It's different. I kind of like it. If you don't like it, I say don't come in, stay away."
Implying that criticism of the coffee shop has been overblown, Rene Brochu said, "The evil is in your head."
To the chagrin of some residents, the shop on Belfast Avenue opened its doors Monday. More than 50 opponents turned out for Planning Board hearings in January, but despite complaints, town officials said there was nothing they could do to stop Crabtree from opening the business.
The coffee shop is in a former motel, which has been the site of many businesses in the last several years, and is located on a sparse stretch of Route 3 just over the Augusta line. It was most recently Mac Daddy's Pub at the Fat Cat Grille, which closed several years ago.
Eight customers -- all men -- stopped by the coffee shop between 10 and 11:15 a.m. Tuesday. Staff members estimated they had between 50 and 60 customers on Monday, despite a snowstorm; of those customers, about eight were women, they said.
Aside from the Brochu brothers, the other customers in the shop Tuesday morning declined to give their names or comment.
Topless waitress Susie Wiley, 23, of Farmingdale, said she went for the job because it's "something different" and said she's worked in coffee shops since she was a teenager.
Asked whether the shop is degrading to women, Wiley said, "No, I love it. I find it very empowering, not degrading."
For now, the menu at the shop is slim: Just cups of New England Coffee ($3 each) and donuts made from Chase Farm Bakery in Whitefield ($2 each). Crabtree said he may offer more food if business picks up.
Elvis Thompson, 32, of Brunswick, was the lone male waiter at the coffee shop Tuesday morning, though he said there are two other male waiters.
Thompson, topless and wearing black boots and black shorts, said he was laid off from another job two weeks ago and then saw an advertisement for the coffee shop.
During the first day, Monday, Thompson said he waited on two ladies, one of whom told him she had been opposed to the business but now she thinks it's great.
Topless waitress Kris Kelley, 43, of Windham, said her previous restaurant experience was managing a pizzeria in Hawaii.
Kelley said criticism of the shop is "ridiculous."
"It's just a body part," she said. "There are more serious issues to worry about in this country than something like this."
Kelley said she gets along with all her co-workers and customers: "We're one big happy family."
Contacted on Tuesday, resident Paula Furbush, who was critical of the coffee shop when it was proposed to the Planning Board, said she had not realized the business had opened.
"I definitely think it's not a good idea. I've lived in town my whole life and we've never had anything like this," Furbush said.
Lisa Breton, a resident for 23 years, said she was surprised the coffee shop opened up.
"I don't believe it's going to pan out, not in a small community like this," Breton said. "People move to these small towns because they don't want to deal with bars and adult video stores and a topless coffee shop. It's important for towns to have an ordinance written so things like this can't happen."
Crabtree said he does not pay his staff a regular wage; all their earnings come from customer tips, mostly ranging from $5 to $20.
On Tuesday morning, Kelley brought coffee to a male customer, who gulped down about half of the cup during a couple minutes, handed Kelley a $100 bill and left without saying a word.
Topless waitress Ginni Labree, 34, of Palermo, wore fluorescent electric pink nail polish and has a tattoo of a rose on her arm. Labree said she has previous experience as a store manager and used to work in dance clubs.
Although "most people have been respectful," Labree said she did encounter inappropriate behavior on Monday when an intoxicated couple came in. The male attempted to touch her, but she backed away. "I told them, 'Hey, we can't touch.'" Labree said she doesn't mind hugging customers or shaking hands.
Labree said she enjoys chatting with people and she has received many compliments from customers, such as "you're pretty, nice body, nice tattoos and you're very colorful."
"I haven't had anybody leave without a smile yet," she said.
Crabtree said he interviewed 150 people for the positions and narrowed the field to 10. Crabtree said he selected people who were the friendliest and comfortable being topless.
"We want to keep the girls respectable, not trashy," said Crabtree, who lives in the motel attached to the shop. "The biggest thing is keeping people happy."

Full text: It's high school graduation time, which means speeches from an important person wearing a funny hat and standing behind a lectern. No one invited us to give a graduation speech, but this is what we'd say if we were invited:
"Dear graduates,
1. Because you are 18 and full of yourself, and we are old and gray, you will ignore everything we say today.
2. But you're sitting there with nothing else to do, so you may as well keep your ears open.
3. That means taking the I-Pod buds out of them.
4. Sex, drugs, Amy Winehouse, American Idol, the Jonas Brothers and MTV's The Hills. Oh, and Madonna, Tila Tequila and Justin Timberlake.
5. We're not allowed to talk about those things at a high school graduation, but maybe now I at least have your attention for a moment.
6. If you wasted your high school years by getting by on the least amount of study, didn't join any clubs or play any sports and just "hung" -- all is not lost.
Tomorrow, you can cast off that identity and start again because the people at the next place you go -- college, a job, the service -- don't know that about you. You have a chance to make a second first impression -- don't blow it.
7. If you made the most of your high school years -- well, you're not like us. But we still like you. You can put your I-Pod buds back in you ears.
8. This is more for the parents: The worst is probably over. You won't believe how nice and considerate your annoying kids will be in about five years. You'll not only love them -- you'll even like them.
9. Graduates -- don't pay any attention to adults who tell you that you have to save the world, or the world is your oyster or any other grand platitude. Resolve now to listen respectfully to what we tell you (because that's good manners), but make up your own damn mind.
10. See No. 1.

Full text: BY CRAIG CROSBY Staff Writer
MONMOUTH -- Turns out a campaign to enforce Maine's seat belt laws is like a box of chocolates: You never know what you're going to get.
Take Monmouth Police Chief Robert Annese, for example. As head of one of 72 police departments around the state that began cracking down on unbuckled motorists this week, Annese and another officer have pulled over one vehicle for a suspected seat-belt violation and found a stash of cocaine.
On Thursday, a traffic stop for a seat-belt violation produced one arrest for drunken driving.
"We're really getting a lot out of the dedicated traffic enforcement stops," Annese said. "It's taking us into a lot of different areas, not just seat belts. We even got a shellfish violation, believe it or not."
The "Click It or Ticket" program, which began Monday and runs through June 1, provides police departments with state Bureau of Highway Safety money to conduct patrols dedicated primarily to enforcing the state's new seat-belt law.
The law, passed last year, made not wearing a seat belt a "primary offense," meaning police have free rein to pull drivers over for the lone infraction of not wearing a seat belt. In the past, police could only cite someone for failing to wear a seat belt if they were pulled over for some other reason.
Fines now range from $50 to $250 for adults and $70 to $310 for children.
In just the first four days, the dedicated patrols in Monmouth pulled over 37 vehicles over for various suspected violations, including seat-belt and registration infractions and speeding.
Of those pulled over, 17 were issued summonses for seat-belt violations; another 10 received warnings.
"We're finding it right now to be highly successful," Annese said.
Gardiner police stopped 36 cars during four details spread over the first three days of the campaign.
Those stops led to 36 summonses -- 33 of which were for seat-belt violations, Gardiner Police Chief James Toman said.
"It's a little surprising that people are still getting pulled over, based on all the media attention that's been given to this two-week event," Toman said.
Waterville police will add one or two officers for high-visibility patrols searching for speeders, drunken drivers and seat-belt violations over the two-week period, Deputy Police Chief Charles Rumsey said.
A four-hour detail Tuesday led to eight summonses, Rumsey said.
"I certainly believe in the power of a heightened visibility enforcement campaign like this, to not only have a specific deterrent but a general deterrent," Rumsey said.
The Somerset County Sheriff's Department has sent deputies with police dogs into schools to talk to children about seat-belt safety, Chief Sheriff's Deputy John Carroll said.
"We're still doing a lot of (public relations) work," he said.
Maine State Police, meanwhile, also is preparing for the invasion of tourists over Memorial Day weekend with extra patrols, both on the ground and in the air.
Those extra patrols will be looking for drunken and aggressive drivers, speeders, and those not complying with seat-belt and child safety seat laws, Col. Patrick J. Fleming, chief of the Maine State Police.
Lt. Gerard Madden of the State Police Troop D -- which patrols in Lincoln, Knox and Waldo counties, in addition to Interstate 295 between Brunswick and Gardiner -- said extra patrols are planed for the China and Randolph areas as well as Gardiner over the two-week campaign.
"Their focus is purely seat-belt enforcement," Madden said. "The good part about special details is they can focus on those (violations) and not get called away."
The idea, police say, is to get more people wearing their seat belts rather than to write tickets.
"It appears people are becoming a little more compliant with seat belts, particularly now that it's a primary law," Madden said. "That was a huge benefit to us."
Monmouth's Annese, who also is chairman of the Maine Chiefs of Police Association's Traffic Safety Committee, said chiefs around the state are reporting better compliance since the law went into full effect in April.
"The more voluntary compliance we have, the better we like it," he said.

Storm losing its punch

AUGUSTA -- The worst of a gale-force, mid-spring storm appears to be over, but there's plenty of mopping up to do.
Downed power lines, fallen trees and limbs hung up on power lines still affected roads and utilities across the region. Some roads were closed or partly blocked by water that had nowhere else to go.
Deputies with the Kennebec County Sheriff's Office fielded a number of calls Monday reporting downed wires or utility poles in China, Vassalboro, Gardiner and Vienna. Flooded roads were a significant problem in Manchester, where water was running across Granite Hill Road and a washout was reported on Elliott Avenue. Flooded roads were also reported in Belgrade, Chelsea and China.
A wind-driven drizzle peppered the region again early Tuesday as smaller rivers and streams brimmed over their banks. The Kennebec River had slightly exceeded flood stage by Tuesday afternoon, and water spread over Augusta's Front Street parking lot.
"Almost a tradition," a local official quipped.
The National Weather Service says the end of this windy, wet week is in sight. By tonight, the chance of precipitation is 50-50, but by Friday, the forecast for the capital is sunny and pushing 60 degrees. The weekend should be just about the same, maybe slightly cooler.
Flash-flood warnings remained in effect in western Maine and gale warnings were still posted along the coast.
In Jefferson, high winds on Monday knocked over a portable toilet, snapping a valve off a tank and spilling 275 gallons of oil near Peaslee's Quick Stop on Route 17. Fire Chief Robert Walker said he was concerned oil might seep into Travel Pond. The Department of Environmental Protection assisted with cleanup.
Walker said he didn't get much sleep: His department and Whitefield's fire department joined other firefighters at a four-alarm fire in Alna on Monday night that leveled a 1700s farmhouse. Wind fanned the flames and officials said there was no way to save the big, vacant house. The fire was out by 4 a.m. Tuesday.
Also in Jefferson, a tree crashed through a North Clary Road bedroom on Monday. No one was hurt, Walker said.
Lincoln County was hard hit while Kennebec County escaped the brunt of the storm, but there was plenty of minor flooding in the region. Somerset County Emergency Management Director Bob Higgins said he had no firm estimates of damage, but "it's been a long two or three days. Numerous trees are down all over the county, there are lots of washouts on roads." he said.
The Sebasticook River was still rising Tuesday afternoon, which could cause some flooding in Pittsfield, he said. The flow on the Kennebec River in Somerset County was slowing, he said.
Gail Rice, spokeswoman for Central Maine Power Company, said that by 5 p.m., Tuesday, power had been restored to more than 56,000 customers. But since 127,585 customers were without electricity during the storm's peak on Monday, that means as many as 70,000 Mainers remained in the dark Tuesday night.
Rice said most of those affected were in Rockland, Brunswick and Portland, and in York County. Power had been restored in Augusta and Fairfield, she said, but statewide, the toll on broken utility poles rose above 200, some snapped by cars running into them.
CMP crews were planning to work through the night Tuesday for the second night in a row, Rice said. The company's power restoration efforts are likely to continue throughout the week in many coastal communities.
To qualify for disaster relief funds, Maine has to meet a $1.5 million threshold set by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Officials said they don't expect that to be a problem. Rob McAleer, director of the Maine Emergency Management Agency, said funds for Maine would be expedited through FEMA's regional director, Art Cleaves. Cleaves headed the Maine emergency agency until a year ago.
McAleer said the state must pay 15 percent, and municipalities 10 percent, to match FEMA grants.
Storm damage to public facilities in the region is likely to be at least several million dollars, Maine Emergency Management officials said Tuesday, but it's too early for precise estimates. For comparison, the ice storm of 1998 caused some $50 million worth of damage, while a 1996 flood in southwestern Maine caused some $6.5 million in damage.
The Kennebec River flood of 1987 caused the most damage, at $100 million, but no loss of life. Higgins recalled that disaster and a close call when he started to cross a Somerset County bridge that no longer reached the other side.
At a news conference Tuesday at state emergency management headquarters, Gov. John Baldacci -- wearing L.L. Bean boots -- praised CMP and other workers struggling to restore electricity, clear trees and repair damaged roads.
"They are doing a heroic job and people in Maine need to know that," Baldacci said. "And at the same time, they need to know to stay out of the way and not compound the problem."
He also complimented Mainers for being good neighbors, for being there to help one another in a time of need.
Baldacci asked Mainers to be patient. High winds have made it difficult to fix downed wires. In hard-hit areas of southern and coastal Maine, "They should be prepared to wait a day or two" for electricity to be back on line, he said.
Power isn't the only hassle. He said the Downeaster passenger train between Portland and Boston has been temporarily halted, and shellfish beds along the coast have been closed for possible pollution from runoff and storm tides.
In Belgrade, Town Manager Dennis Keschl said the town got off easy.
"We made it through fairly well," he said. "There were a few branches in the road, probably from the heavy snow."
As of Tuesday afternoon, he gave this brief summary: "Snow is all gone. Ready for spring. Flowers are coming up."

Bond request offers new vision

Full text: Consider that the state of Maine is a business. In a business, you must do two very important things: Maintain your infrastructure and invest in your capacity to grow.
Over the last few years, Maine has done a poor job at both those essential tasks. For a variety of reasons -- political wrangling between the Democrats and the Republicans, lack of leadership and vision -- the state has not paid for the upkeep of its transportation systems and the upgrade and maintenance of its water and sewer systems. It has given only fitful and episodic attention to investing in effective economic development. A TIF here, a trade mission there, a last-ditch attempt to keep a mill open -- these are hardly acts that spring from a unified and systematic approach to statewide economic development.
Much of that poor record can be remedied if the Legislature can get past partisan politics and pork barreling for select constituents and accepts at least a version of the bond plan Gov. John Baldacci unveiled on Tuesday.
The governor has proposed paying serious attention to the state's infrastructure needs, with a bond package of $131 million for transportation and $20 million in water and sewer system upgrades to be voted on by the state's citizens in June. That's appropriate for safety and environmental reasons. It's also appropriate because, in the case of roads and bridges, it's more expensive for businesses to run trucks over poor roads and to take detours because of posted roads and bridges. And even the water and sewer system upgrades have economic development potential: In the case of coastal towns and cities, cleaning up their sewage treatment plants can mean opening up long-closed shellfish flats, which can then generate income for harvesters.
For the November ballot, Baldacci has proposed a bold program of investment in targeted economic development based on helping the state's own businesses and industries grow, not simply on going begging to out-of-state industries. That includes millions of dollars for research and development, which will support our state's budding industries as they attempt to compete in a global economy by devising innovative approaches to boat building, aquaculture and genetics, among many other fields. His bond proposal includes significant investment, as well, in higher education bricks and mortar. When there isn't enough classroom space to accommodate the growing number of students who need education and training to fill jobs, that's an economic development problem.
The economic investment aspects of Baldacci's bond plan are based on the accurate perception that Maine is transitioning out of a natural resources-based industry built on a small number of large employers fed by a blue-collar workforce, and into a new economy of smaller employers sprinkled across the state who need highly skilled and educated workers. That's been a hard reality for politicians and Maine workers alike to accept, because it demands radical change in how we perceive ourselves in this state. It means, essentially, that the opportunities that used to be there are diminished, and that it will take significant work, from government and individual citizens, to transform from the old ways of doing things into the new.
The bond package also includes investments in the state's environmental infrastructure, which lawmakers should seriously consider. With tourism an ever-greater part of our economic activity, the shameful neglect of the state's parks and historic sites needs to be remedied. So, too, the Land for Maine's Future fund needs replenishment if it's to continue its fruitful partnership with the federal government and private donors to conserve land that would otherwise be lost to private development.
As we have for months now, we urge lawmakers to set aside their historic differences and consider the larger future of the state when they take up the governor's bond requests. Certainly, there are many competing proposals for bonds -- by some counts, $2 billion in requests so far.
That leads us to the conclusion that it's no longer a question of "if" Maine should bond in order to take care of business. Rather, it's a matter of what we should spend that money on. In our view, it's time to invest in this state's future, and to do that wholeheartedly and with a determined, inclusive and progressive vision that can take us into a prosperous future. That's what the governor's proposal offers.

WHITEFIELD -- Support your local brewer.
After nearly a dozen years of running a small brewery, Steve Gorrill says he really wouldn't want to be doing anything else.
At the end of a long day at Sheepscot Valley Brewing Co., he settles down with a pint of Pemaquid Ale in his cozy farmhouse with his family, and hey, life is pretty good.
So, apparently, is the beer.
He has already brewed about 600 gallons this month, and in the busy beer-drinking month of August, he rolls out 2,000 gallons.
He supplies kegs to local pubs and bars, and "growlers" -- the term for a half-gallon bottle -- to local stores.
In a year, Sheepscot Valley puts out 12,500 gallons of brew. Besides the popular Pemaquid Ale, he produces New Harbor Lager, Damariscotta Double Brown, Sheepscot River Pale Ale, and Boothbay Special Bitter.
At Riverfront Barbecue and Grille in Augusta, waitress Miranda St. Peter raved about Pemaquid Ale, saying it's a top-seller that "goes best with barbecue."
King Eider's Pub in Damariscotta confirmed that Pemaquid Ale is always on tap there, and a bartender says it does "phenomenally" well.
At The Narrows Tavern in Waldoboro, Pemaquid Ale is frequently on tap. "We've sold plenty of it," co-owner Jeff Hurd said.
A ramshackle barn that serves as the brewery -- it's spic-and-span inside -- and the whole enterprise has a laid-back atmosphere. But Gorrill said he can put in a 70-hour week and get plenty of exercise doing it.
It's a one-man operation, and on his budget, hiring help is out of the question.
His wife, Louisa, whom he met 22 years ago at the University of Maine in Orono, sometimes gives him a hand. But, mostly, he works alone.
"I sell enough to break even," Gorrill said. "I do very well in one small area, and that's fine. My beer doesn't cost any more than Sam Adams, which is 400 times bigger than me."
A growler runs anywhere from $6.50 to $8, depending on the retailer's price. Bottles are returnable and refillable.
Gorrill said he may soon branch out with 22-ounce bottles, and if that works, maybe even six-packs. But it's unlikely he will ever lose the "micro" in front of his brewery.
Small is what he wants to be.
He tried raising oysters. Then he started doing some home brewing about 15 years ago and it almost seamlessly morphed into a microbrewery.
"I never really figured out what I wanted to do," he joked. "This works. It pays the bills." The couple have two children, Robert, 12, and Allie, 9.
Louisa Gorrill said she is grateful for being able to stay home with the children while also training to be an occupational therapy assistant at Kennebec Valley Community College.
"For me, it's been great," she said of Steve's work. "He has the right attitude, and yeah, he makes good beer."Sheepscot Valley Brewing recently upped its capacity to brew, obtaining a 750-gallon kettle from Allagash Brewing Co., another Maine microbrewery that is growing.
Gorrill said he doesn't mind if customers drive right up to his brewery to buy a growler or a keg. The business is located on Hollywood Boulevard in Whitefield, a short distance off Route 194.
The resemblance to Hollywood stops with the name. It's a rural back road and that's the way Gorrill likes it.
"People should really support Maine brewing, and drink Maine beer," the brewmaster declared. "There's no reason to go anywhere else."

Full text: By DAVID HENCH Blethen Maine Newspapers
SCARBOROUGH -- Officer David Corbeau stares out over the expanse of mudflats that is his beat, trying to pick out the subtle signs of someone breaking the law.
What he sees are a handful of "the hardest working people you'll find," bent at the waist and wielding a heavy hand-held rake as they slice the fetid mud in search of clams.
Corbeau is looking for unlicensed diggers or those digging in areas closed for conservation or because of pollution, people who threaten the resource and the viability of the industry.
"Most of the guys in Scarborough, I have to give them credit, are pretty legal," Corbeau says. "People will still try to go out there and push the limits a little bit and we do write tickets."
This is the busy season for clamming and for the officers who protect the resource. Maine's appetite for clams swells in the summer tourist season, and so too does the temptation for a digger to take advantage of the high prices by breaking the law.
Unlicensed diggers are drawn to the quick payday, and unscrupulous diggers can reap a bonanza from closed flats without competition from those obeying the law. The closure of clam flats, because of red tide or polluted runoff, can also leave diggers desperate for income, particularly in the summer months when they count on making most of their money.
That's why towns up and down the coast employ clam wardens, officers whose primary job is to police the flats. Local wardens, working with Marine Patrol officers, try to make sure people are only digging where they're allowed.
"We're mainly trying to protect the public. We want people to continue eating clams," says Corbeau, reciting a fear shared around the industry that if anyone got seriously ill from tainted shellfish it could jeopardize the reputation of Maine clams.
"We also have an industry to protect. It's a shame we have to rely on licenses, but if we don't, the resource would be gone," he says.
When the tide goes out, diggers use their rakes to peel back slices of mud and pick out clams that exceed 2 inches. It can take as many as 1,000 clams to fill a 50-pound bushel. A good digger working in a good spot can pull as many as six bushels in a tide, though three or four is more common. In the winter, when prices are $40 a bushel, a day's work might yield $100. But around July 4, when the price hits more than $150 a bushel, the payday is much better. That's when the temptation to break the law grows. Licensed diggers will sometimes take clams smaller than the legal limit, or they will dig in closed areas. Sometimes a digger licensed in one town will dig in another. Or a digger with a recreational license will dig beyond the one-peck limit and add them to a commercial digger's harvest, doubling the amount of clams that can be sold.
Towns that offer commercial licenses -- which can generate hundreds of thousands of dollars for the local economy -- are required to have enforcement. Some have part-time wardens. Others have full-time police officers like Corbeau. His tools include binoculars, a skiff, a kayak and thigh-high boots, in addition to a pistol and emergency vehicle.
Clamming is more like agriculture than fishing in many ways. Clams must be allowed to grow to harvestable size, and some flats are seeded with small clams to increase productivity later. But the flats are also a communal resource and without management and enforcement, would suffer from overharvesting.
Towns sometimes close coves to give clams time to grow. Those conservation closures protect the resource for later in the year.
The state also shuts down coves for pollution, usually caused by runoff from heavy rain, or for toxic algae, called red tide. Clams are filter feeders, meaning they draw the microscopic marine organisms they feed on from the water that passes through them. That means they also can absorb contaminants like bacteria or viruses. Digging in an area closed for pollution is an arrestable offense, and wardens take it seriously. This spring, Corbeau, who has been shellfish officer for 11 years, spotted the telltale tracks of a clam digger on a flat closed for high levels of pollution. He tried for weeks to catch the person, finally spotting him one night. Corbeau called Marine Patrol for backup, then waited.
"We sat and watched the gentleman dig for almost four hours," Corbeau said. Wardens hesitate to charge down onto the flats after a suspect. A poacher can get away in a boat before a warden can navigate the soupy terrain. They also can dump a catch, giving the warden a harder case to prove in court.
In this case, the man was arrested when he returned to shore, charged with digging in a prohibited area, washing clams in a prohibited area, possession of untagged shellfish, falsifying shellfish tags and digging without a town license. He faces $7,000 in fines and could lose his state license. The officers dumped 187 pounds of clams he dug, worth over $250.
"Some people are opportunists," says Marine Resources Sgt. Rene Cloutier, who supervises enforcement from St. George to the Kennebec River. "You can go into a closed area and in half the time get twice the clams."
Catching poachers can require patience and knowledge of an area. "A lot of the closed areas are fairly remote, so unless you get out and start walking around and looking at all the nooks and crannies of closed areas, somebody could be digging there," Cloutier said. It can be hard to convince some people of the risks of digging in a polluted area, says Donald Card, a Department of Marine Resources biologist. "Some people don't believe in it. They think it's a big conspiracy," Card said. "They say they've been eating clams all their life and never got sick." Others just don't care, callous to the deadly threat posed by eating clams tainted by red tide.
Terry Watson of Phippsburg has been digging clams for 31 years and buying and selling them as a dealer for 25. He supports open enforcement rather than surreptitious efforts to catch law breakers.
"Visibility keeps the honest guy honest," Watson says. "He won't pick up the short clams. If he sees him out there every day, he won't go in the closed areas."
There are those who will disregard the laws when the price is right, he said. "They get away with it one tide and they've made their fine money and then they'll go until they get caught," he said.
Tim Downs, a Scarborough clammer who says he's been digging since he was 6, says the presence of a warden is the price for keeping the resource healthy. He says if clams from a closed area make a consumer sick, it would have dire repercussions for the industry.
A state analysis last year found that along the southern coast, Harpswell, Scarborough and Brunswick had the most aggressive enforcement. Those towns invest substantial municipal funds in shellfish management, whereas communities like West Bath and Phippsburg rely on license fees to support their programs, said Card, the biologist.
Cumberland County Sheriff Mark Dion this year honored Deputies Andy Schenk and John Cross for their work policing Harpswell's mud flats. The town, which has 83 commercial diggers, got the state's highest rating in its annual review.
"I wanted to reinforce the fact that just because it's not what we perceive to be traditional law enforcement, it's absolutely vital to the community," Dion said. "Speeders in North Deering affect the quality of life but it doesn't impinge on someone's livelihood."

Considering Prof. Hawking's question

Full text: College classrooms, the bowels of the university library at 1 a.m., the New York Review of Books and French cafes are generally where philosophy gets discussed in our culture -- if it gets discussed at all. That's why it's such a refreshing surprise to find matters of the deepest existential import on, of all places, "Yahoo! Answers."
We speak of the Web site on which anyone can ask a question and anyone can give an answer. Bored sitting at your desk at work? Post a question and then see what breaks loose. "What's the youngest age of petrified wood?" asks one curious person. "Can God be separated into pieces upon request?" asks another. "What is management accounting? State the differences between management accounting and financial accounting." Er, was that a question? "If you don't like a question, do you still answer? Why?" Things can get pretty heavy on "Yahoo! Answers," though there's always the very matter-of-fact query as well: "How do I stretch a sneaker/shoe?"
Somebody at Yahoo -- presumably a philosophy major who found they could make a lot more money outside of the academy -- decided recently to invite some really important people to pose some really important questions on the Web site. So rock star Bono asks for suggestions about ending world poverty (an issue that has occupied his energies for years), Al Gore has requested ideas for reversing global climate change and, most profoundly, famed physicist Stephen Hawking has asked, "In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race survive the next hundred years?"
It's a question, Professor Hawking, that we ask ourselves in this business all the time. We're on the front lines of all the bad news -- if something nasty happens, we hear about it. In fact, we often dig it up. We're aware of the depravity of mankind, the illogic of our actions, our destructiveness, cruelty and foolishness. If there's anyone who's worried that there might not be a world as we know it a hundred years from now, it's us. And if you think it doesn't bother us, that we simply smile and revel cynically in all the bad news because it sells newspapers -- "Get me rewrite!" -- then you've got us pegged wrong. We're concerned.
We've had a week to read through the answers to Hawking -- well, not all of them, as to date there have been 23,068, which in and of itself is encouraging. There are the innocently communitarian: "We need to sit down and work together not fighting with each other." There are more sophisticated and jaded answers: "There are too many mechanisms at play, naturally, socially, politically, to completely fall apart," which somehow manages to sound world weary and optimistic at the same time.
There's the political answer that keeps cropping up, ignoring the longterm nature of Hawking's question: "Right now, we need to worry about the next two years until we get a new president." And then there's the surfer philosophy, complete with emotions: "The Human spirit will overcome :-) It's within us dude we're fighters and survivors. Yeah!"
And during this past week, we've also considered our own response to the question. As we write this, rockets are being lobbed back and forth between Lebanon and Israel. People in Baghdad are afraid to leave their homes; they're also afraid to stay in their homes. North Korea is trying to figure out how to send nuclear missiles our way; Iran is working deep underground to develop its own nuclear capacity. Hundreds of people are dead in Mumbai after a terrorist bomb. Red tide has closed shellfish beds on our southern coast, and our loons -- the thrilling and mournful voice of the North -- are suffering from mercury poisoning. We've just thrown out all our teflon pans for fear of being poisoned by them. If we don't do something about global warming, then parking lots along the coast could become shorefront property. How can the human race survive the next hundred years, indeed?
We don't have a complicated answer. This is an editorial, after all, not a dissertation. The answer has to do with our children. (It doesn't matter if you don't have children; even if you don't, you must have someone else's children you care about.)
If we're to survive the next hundred years -- no, if we're to thrive in the next hundred years, a more noble goal -- then we need a different guiding philosophy than the one currently at work in our world. Not the one that says we take the short-term perspective and grab everything we need and to heck with whoever has to pick up the pieces or clean up the messes after us. That's what gets us wars without end, toxins in our water and tunnels that fall apart and kill innocent people.
There's a phrase, erroneously attributed to a Native American chief, that says we must consider the consequences of our actions through the next seven generations. We'd be happy if we could demonstrate that humanity, as a whole, and each of us, individually, has begun to consider the kind of world we're making simply for our children. If we truly love and care about them, then we can't possibly hand them a world where diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis afflict a staggering percentage of people in the Third World; where we witness the devastating carnage of ethnic and religious wars every day; where our addiction to fossil fuels is making deadly changes in our climate; where corporate greed and malfeasance threatens the hard-earned retirement of tens of thousands of people; and where freedom and the right to speak our minds are threatened at home as well as abroad.
That's it, our philosophy for the day -- that we must be responsible to something, and someone, beyond our own self interest. Or to put it as our surfer dude friend on Yahoo would: "Yo! It's like, about the future, man! :-)"

By SETH HARKNESS
Blethen Maine Newspapers
After nearly a four-week forced vacation, clammers in southern Maine were allowed to return to work Tuesday after the state lifted a ban on digging due to red tide.
The state Department of Marine Resources reopened soft-shell clam flats from the New Hampshire border to Prout's Neck in Scarborough. Harvesting clams was still prohibited from Scarborough to Small Point in Phippsburg, although the DMR's red tide specialist, Darcie Couture, said this region would likely reopen to clam digging by Thursday.
"Things are cleaning up," she said.
This year's early-summer red-tide bloom has sidelined clammers in southern Maine since mid-June, although some limited areas, such as the Scarborough Marsh, remained open because of lower levels of the toxin.
Red tide is a marine algae that historically grows in Maine waters in the warmer months and contains toxins that can make shellfish poisonous to anyone who eats them. While the red tide has now subsided enough to reopen some clam flats, it is still dense enough to make more sensitive species of shellfish unsafe.
Virtually the entire coast is still subject to closures for mussels, carnivorous snails, European oysters and surf clams. Bans on soft-shell clams, one of Maine's most valuable seafood species, are particularly costly to diggers, seafood dealers and restaurants.
Shellfish wholesalers said the harvesting bans have pushed up the price of clams, which is close to $5 per pound at some stores. But the shortage never became as acute as last summer, when southern Maine clam flats were closed for 57 days, or about twice as long as this year. "It wasn't nearly as bad as last year," said Stephanie Nadeau, owner of The Lobster Company on Route 1 in Arundel.
"Last year was something of a bust." Couture said this year's red tide occurrence looks like it will rank as an average-sized bloom over the next decade. Last year's was the worst in 30 years. Even so, some clammers said an average bloom is too big and they can no longer make a living digging clams.
"I had to get a day job," said Don Schwab, a telephone technician from Limerick who until four years ago dug clams commercially in the Cape Porpoise area. Schwab still goes out on weekends to dig recreationally, but he said harvesting closures in the middle of the period when clam prices are at their peak had forced him out of business.
"Clamming is more or less a part-time job right now," he said.
Nadeau, the seafood store owner, said she expected to see a rush of clams hit the market over the next few days now that she is paying $2.60 per pound to diggers and the harvesting ban has been lifted.
"They'll hurry to get them while the price is up," she said.

Congress approved $5 million in federal relief this week for New England shellfish harvesters affected by last year's devastating red tides -- just as another round of algae blooms closed Maine clamflats.
The aid comes after some political wrangling on Capitol Hill, and as concerns mount about recent closures due to flooding and red tide.
"I think we're going to see a worse year," said RJ Mere, a member of Kennebunk's Shellfish Committee and a recreational clam digger.
The state banned shellfish harvesting in varying degrees from the New Hampshire border to Owls Head Light this week because of red tide. Some of the areas were closed earlier this year because of runoff from heavy rains that flooded York County.
Last year, the worst New England red tide prompted harvesting bans and restrictions that lasted more than a month, triggering a federal disaster declaration in late June because of economic losses in the millions.
John Lyon, 54, of Scarborough, a commercial digger for approximately 40 years, estimated he lost $20,000 in income last year.
"It's always something," he said.
Lyon said a "very, very, very small percentage" of harvesters he knows took advantage of the low-interest loans offered after the 2005 red tide, because the application process was too complicated.
"It's more to serve business owners," he said of the Small Business Administration loans offered in the immediate aftermath of the closures.
Money from this week's appropriation will go through two federal agencies and will ultimately be disbursed by the state Department of Marine Resources.
The $5 million aid package was approved Wednesday in the House and Thursday in the Senate. The request survived a political challenge and "intense" debate that whittled it down from $20 million, said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
The request drew support from every senator in Maine and Massachusetts, the two states hit hardest by the 2005 red tide.
"It was a challenge. I heard at the beginning of the week that we didn't even have any money in there," Ferrier said. The money was included in an emergency supplemental bill that also provided funds for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Hurricane Katrina relief.
It was one of 19 proposed spending items in the supplemental bill that Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. chided as indefensible "pork-barrel" spending and sought to remove in early May.
Ferrier said the New England relief proposal was slashed amid pressure to keep spending down. "We certainly understand that a lot of shellfishermen are going through some tough times," she said.

WATERVILLE -- An Augusta organization that has fought the preponderance of big-box stores in that city earned one of three outstanding activism awards presented Saturday during a summit of environmental activists at Colby College.
Timothy Bolton of West Side Neighbors accepted the award on behalf of GoodGrowth at the sixth annual Maine Environmental Action Conference.
The Androscoggin River Alliance and Friends of Casco Bay also won activism awards.
Peter Montague, director of the Environmental Research Foundation in New Jersey, was the featured speaker. Environmentalists from throughout the state attended the all-day conference at Lovejoy Auditorium.
In a referendum vote held in June, GoodGrowth lost its effort to stop development of a 500,000-square-foot development in a 70-acre wooded residential area. GoodGrowth joined with another group that opposed a new Hannaford supermarket -- an effort that also failed.
But GoodGrowth has vowed to continue the fight to educate the public on the surge of huge chain stores in Augusta. Bolton assured the audience of that.
"The fight is not over," Bolton said in accepting the award. "We have a long way to go to mitigate some of this development that is coming in."
Montague, editor of the widely read Rachel's Weekly environmental and health newsletter, said the regulatory system falsely determines what is safe or has acceptable risks.
The system's method, quantitative risk assessments, allows industry to show that the damage it does is acceptable, Montague said.
He framed the problem as an "us versus them" scenario.
"The purpose of our adversaries is to get us into that regulatory process," Montague said. "It's their briar patch, where they're at home."
Environmentalists find themselves boxed in by the system, he said.
"It constrains us and confines us so that we can't get out of the regulatory box," Montague said. "It's time to get out of that box. It doesn't even have to be the only game that we play."
To get out of the box, Montague proposed, activists should focus "on the actor instead of the action."
He pointed to writing on the chalkboard, showing that 1 percent of the population owns half the private wealth in this country, and 5 percent owns two-thirds. The few control the many.
If communities controlled their own decisions regarding investment, land use and common assets, the world would be a different place. If workplaces were democratized, so that workers made the decisions and shared proportionately in the rewards, communities could become more stable and self-confident.
The New Brunswick, N.J. resident began by rattling off 10 signs of trouble, indicating that all is not well.
Among the bad signs:
n The cancer rate in Maine is 17 percent higher than the national average, making it fourth-highest in the nation.
n Four signs involve declining populations and disease in ocean life such as lobster, oysters, horseshoe crabs and cod.
n Plum Creek plans to change the zoning of its Maine land holdings. Montague described the Plum Creek plan as "an ominous sign from the viewpoint of preserving the Maine woods."
Closer to his home, Montague rattled off the chilling statistic that everyone in New Jersey lives within 10 miles of an Environmental Protection Agency Superfund toxic waste site.
"There was a workshop this morning about not turning Maine into New Jersey," Montague said. "I'm all for that."

WASHINGTON -- Small-business owners complained at a congressional hearing this week about lengthy waits for government loans and confusing rules for aid following Hurricane Katrina. At the same time, members of the Senate Small Business Committee also said the system for approving loans must be improved.
Criticism followed press reports earlier this month that a program created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks sent the vast majority of $3.75 billion in loans to businesses outside New York and Washington.
Hector Barreto, head of the Small Business Administration, dismissed press reports as inaccurate. He said many loans were distributed as part of a regular government loan program that had nothing to do with Sept. 11.
"There has been a lot of inaccurate reporting, a lot of misrepresentations," Barreto said.
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine and committee chairman, voiced "deep concerns" about the loan program. She asked the inspector general to review the program and said she would later hold a hearing to explore his findings. She called the hearing Thursday to spur aid to Louisiana and Mississippi in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.
President Bush has proposed legislation that would increase disaster loans for small businesses from $1.5 million to $10 million and allow a 12-month period without payments.
"It is critical that we act now," Snowe said. "We want to do everything we can to mitigate this tremendous disaster."
Business owners had a variety of complaints. Richard Harris, owner of Harris Homes LLC in Ocean Springs, Miss., said financial assistance from SBA or the Federal Emergency Management Agency takes 90 to 120 days.
"There is little or no reliable information available to businesses or individuals," Harris said, complaining that the agencies "do not appear to have a unified approach."
Barreto replied that his agency aims to approve loans in days rather than months. He said his agency's emergency offices are located at FEMA sites.
The SBA has distributed 800,000 applications for disaster loans and received 12,000 replies so far. But the agency has approved only 76 loans totaling $4 million, acknowledged Herbert Mitchell, associate administrator of disaster assistance.
"We've got to do more and we've got to speed up the process," Mitchell said. Confusion about government rules was a recurrent theme.
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., noted that when a so-called "red tide" devastated New England shellfish this year, the SBA sent fishermen seeking loans to the Agriculture Department, which also rejected them.
Kerry asked if the SBA would help Gulf Coast fishermen of crawfish and shrimp. He argued that legislation approved by the Senate and stalled in the House would solve the problem, but Barreto declined to endorse it.
The dispute is a narrow one. If fishermen simply catch fish, the SBA can provide loans. If they raise fish, they are considered farmers served by the Agriculture Department. Administration officials pledged to resolve the confusion. "We don't want folks to be getting the runaround," Barreto said.

Full text: Exotic species of animals and plants are wrecking Maine's environment. But we have not yet reached the point where an all-out war has been declared to eliminate unwelcome species.
In fact, we put out the welcome mat for some exotics while condemning others, an inconsistent approach that leaves Maine's native plants and animals vulnerable.
Last month, France declared war on the giant Californian bullfrog, sending hunters into the night with night-vision sights, silencers and rifles.
"It seemed like a rather mean-spirited approach at first," said environmental campaigner Luc Gueugneau, "but we found that it was the best way of killing all the adults."
These huge, aggressive frogs were illegally introduced in France 37 years ago, as a joke, in a private pond. Growing to more than 4 pounds and nearly 2 feet in length, they have taken over ponds, lakes, marshes and gravel pits.
You might compare them to northern pike -- another large, aggressive predator that has taken over every body of water in Maine into which it has been illegally dumped.
But we have chosen a different path, deploring the abundance of pike introductions, but managing them as a new game fish that are highly prized for their size.
Addressing the problem of exotic species is difficult because some we love, some we loathe.
Two of the most popular fish in Maine are -- brace yourself -- not native to our state: smallmouth bass and brown trout. And we are about to go wild for rainbow trout, another non-native species that will soon be stocked in hundreds of Maine waters.
Adding complexity to the issue is the fact that state biologists stocked many waters with these exotics, then condemned anglers who took these fish to other waters where they compete with native species.
And it gets even more complicated when you get to species such as white perch, native in waters along the coast but introduced illegally all over the state where they crowd out native species such as brook trout.
If you spend much time studying the problem of exotic species, you would likely be very discouraged -- unless of course you like dandelion greens and hard-fighting muskies. One man's deadly exotic is another man's delightful dream.
A recent survey found sea squirts in Cobscook Bay, an exotic species that can overwhelm shellfish beds. Squirts have rapidly colonized already on the Georges Bank fishing ground.
"It's an almost scary sort of animal. It smothers everything that's underneath it," one scientist said.
Plants can be scary, too. Most Mainers have heard of the potential misery caused by milfoil, and we all know how prolific purple loosestrife has become. Hydrilla has been found in a pond in Limerick.
But hey, some people think loosestrife are beautiful, and when Acadia National Park staff tried this year to stamp out the exotic lupines in the park, the local citizenry almost tarred and feathered them.
Perhaps we can agree that those Asian lady beetles that crowd into sunny spots all over the inside of our houses are darned annoying. Even worse, the Asian Longhorn Beetle is now in New York, which is too close for comfort.
We can also agree that the arrival of the Japanese rock pool mosquitoes to join their biting cousins here is overkill, given that we already have 40 or more kinds of mosquitoes in Maine.
Not all of these exotics have been illegally introduced in Maine. Some hitchhiked on our boats and motor vehicles. Some were brought by waterfowl and other birds. Many arrived on their own four feet. Possums and turkey vultures are now here, probably because of warming temperatures.
And I have not even mentioned coyotes, a non-native predator that has brought serious changes to the fields and forests of Maine.
In the future, we will be called upon to pony up big bucks to deal with some of these problem species. Most we will ignore. Some will bring us benefits. Few will be benign.
If you care about Maine, the Maine we inherited and will hand on to the next generation, you will educate yourself about the species of concern, heed the warnings of state officials to be careful of what you are letting loose out there and contribute to the causes that protect native species such as brook trout and landlocked salmon.
Admittedly, it is hard to take all of this seriously -- when we choose to label some exotics as desirable and others as demons.
I guess value is in the eye of the beholder. But if more Mainers do not place a higher value on our native species of plants and animals, future generations will only read about them in books.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- The owner and leading scientific mind of a little-known Augusta corporation predicts a miracle molecule he created more than decade ago will soon push his high-tech firm to the forefront of public attention.
Blaise McArdle, a surfactant chemist and president of VPP Corp., says his invention has a broad array of applications as incongruous as preserving and enhancing fish, and reducing the cost and improving the durability of roads.
"It'll be a household word in two years," the entrepreneur scientist said confidently. "We can do everything from size clothing, adhere colors on cloth, improve the pulp-paper process, clean up wastewater and prevent soil erosion. We can also use it to make environmentally friendly herbicides and pesticides and fertilizer that is self-renewing."
VPP stands for vegetable protein process, which both describes the protein-based molecule he discovered and the basis for his corporation's name.
A surfactant chemist specializes in soap compounds, the 54-year-old chemist explained. He and a friend became involved with the invention in the 1980s, when he was working on reducing the toxicity of materials in home detergents. "I was looking for a binding agent that was a little more people-friendly," he said.
McArdle's friend came to him for help when the friend was doing research with a form of gum believed to reduce cholesterol in people's diets, but difficult to digest in quantities necessary to be effective Together, they experimented with different liquids that would react with the gum.
In the process he discovered what he calls the vegetable protein process or VPP, as it is used in food products, and a "protein polysaccharide process" or PPC for the industrial grade of the product. Both use natural ingredients in the process classified t U.S. Food and Drug Administration as "generally recognized as safe," McArdle said.
For the next several months, he worked extending and manipulating the protein he discovered and, over the last several years, has refined the compounds for different uses and worked to claim a "composition of matter" patent to protect his creations.
The VPP Corp. has also spun off a number of other companies, all which McArdle is owner, to apply his scientific discoveries to a growing variety of applications.
One of the first on the market has been the use of the VPP process to prevent the spoiling of fish and shellfish. Large-scale commercial trials are going on now, and McArdle said the benefits to fishermen, shippers and processors are so dramatic that he expects the process to be standard across the industry in the very near future.
Treating the fish products, he said, allows fishermen more time at sea before their catch needs to be refrigerated or frozen, and permits extended freezer time. As an added bonus, fish that has been treated shrinks much less when cooked, he said.
"This is totally revolutionary. There is nothing like this," he said after announcing receipt of his "composition of matter" patent. "People have been trying to protect the freshness of their food for 5,000 years."
His protein process is being used to enhance filters, remove industrial pollutants, and improve both asphalt and dirt roads.
McArdle said Canadian transportation officials will be conducting widescale tests of asphalt treated with his product this summer. He that adding the protein developed for that use makes the asphalt cling more tightly to stones in the mix, making the road surface more flexible and therefore less susceptible to cracking. It also allows manufacturers to use 5 to 30 percent less oil in the production of the asphalt itself.
McArdle was reluctant to describe the size of his company.
A resident of Rome when he started the corporation, he now lives and works in Gloucester, Mass. But he said many of his investors are from Maine, and he and his relatives summer in the Belgrade Lakes area.
The company that manufactures the additives he now sells, VPP Manufacturing, is a subsidiary in Kittery and plans are under way to build other manufacturing facilities in California and Canada, he said.
McArdle said he hopes the Maine-based corporation will spin off economic opportunities for the state where it all started.
Besides the Kittery manufacturing plant, he said one joint venture that shows promise is VPP Filter & Reclamation Corp. in Waterville, which produces filters treated with the protein that more effectively remove pollutants from fluid.
"I'm kind of hoping to employ a lot of people in the state of Maine," McArdle said.
While the potential the process promises seems to be nearly limitless, McArdle said corporation officials have their feet firmly planted on the ground.
And no matter how successful the firm becomes, McArdle said he plans to stay in the laboratory looking for other scientific breakthroughs rather than putting on a corporate hat. In fact, he said, he already has a number of other promising research projects cooking.
"We're not a pie-in-the-sky bunch. We're a very conservative group," McArdle said. "We're very enthusiastic, though, about our product and we think it will go a long way."
WHAT VPP IS AND WHAT IT MAY DO
* VPP stands for vegetable protein process; which both describes the protein-based molecule and the basis for the corporation's name.
* The VPP Corp. has also spun off a number of other companies to apply these scientific discoveries to a growing variety of applications.
* One of the first uses on the market has been to prevent the spoiling of fish and shellfish. Large-scale commercial trials are going on now.
* The protein process is being used to enhance filters, remove industrial pollutants, and improve both asphalt and dirt roads.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- The owner and leading scientific mind of a little-known Augusta corporation predicts a miracle molecule he created more than decade ago will soon push his high-tech firm to the forefront of public attention.
Blaise McArdle, a surfactant chemist and president of VPP Corp., says his invention has a broad array of applications as incongruous as preserving and enhancing fish, and reducing the cost and improving the durability of roads.
"It'll be a household word in two years," the entrepreneur scientist said confidently. "We can do everything from size clothing, adhere colors on cloth, improve the pulp-paper process, clean up wastewater and prevent soil erosion. We can also use it to make environmentally friendly herbicides and pesticides and fertilizer that is self-renewing."
VPP stands for vegetable protein process, which both describes the protein-based molecule he discovered and the basis for his corporation's name.
A surfactant chemist specializes in soap compounds, the 54-year-old chemist explained. He and a friend became involved with the invention in the 1980s, when he was working on reducing the toxicity of materials in home detergents. "I was looking for a binding agent that was a little more people-friendly," he said.
McArdle's friend came to him for help when the friend was doing research with a form of gum believed to reduce cholesterol in people's diets, but difficult to digest in quantities necessary to be effective Together, they experimented with different liquids that would react with the gum.
In the process he discovered what he calls the vegetable protein process or VPP, as it is used in food products, and a "protein polysaccharide process" or PPC for the industrial grade of the product. Both use natural ingredients in the process classified t U.S. Food and Drug Administration as "generally recognized as safe," McArdle said.
For the next several months, he worked extending and manipulating the protein he discovered and, over the last several years, has refined the compounds for different uses and worked to claim a "composition of matter" patent to protect his creations.
The VPP Corp. has also spun off a number of other companies, all which McArdle is owner, to apply his scientific discoveries to a growing variety of applications.
One of the first on the market has been the use of the VPP process to prevent the spoiling of fish and shellfish. Large-scale commercial trials are going on now, and McArdle said the benefits to fishermen, shippers and processors are so dramatic that he expects the process to be standard across the industry in the very near future.
Treating the fish products, he said, allows fishermen more time at sea before their catch needs to be refrigerated or frozen, and permits extended freezer time. As an added bonus, fish that has been treated shrinks much less when cooked, he said.
"This is totally revolutionary. There is nothing like this," he said after announcing receipt of his "composition of matter" patent. "People have been trying to protect the freshness of their food for 5,000 years."
His protein process is being used to enhance filters, remove industrial pollutants, and improve both asphalt and dirt roads.
McArdle said Canadian transportation officials will be conducting widescale tests of asphalt treated with his product this summer. He that adding the protein developed for that use makes the asphalt cling more tightly to stones in the mix, making the road surface more flexible and therefore less susceptible to cracking. It also allows manufacturers to use 5 to 30 percent less oil in the production of the asphalt itself.
McArdle was reluctant to describe the size of his company.
A resident of Rome when he started the corporation, he now lives and works in Gloucester, Mass. But he said many of his investors are from Maine, and he and his relatives summer in the Belgrade Lakes area.
The company that manufactures the additives he now sells, VPP Manufacturing, is a subsidiary in Kittery and plans are under way to build other manufacturing facilities in California and Canada, he said.
McArdle said he hopes the Maine-based corporation will spin off economic opportunities for the state where it all started.
Besides the Kittery manufacturing plant, he said one joint venture that shows promise is VPP Filter & Reclamation Corp. in Waterville, which produces filters treated with the protein that more effectively remove pollutants from fluid.
"I'm kind of hoping to employ a lot of people in the state of Maine," McArdle said.
While the potential the process promises seems to be nearly limitless, McArdle said corporation officials have their feet firmly planted on the ground.
And no matter how successful the firm becomes, McArdle said he plans to stay in the laboratory looking for other scientific breakthroughs rather than putting on a corporate hat. In fact, he said, he already has a number of other promising research projects cooking.
"We're not a pie-in-the-sky bunch. We're a very conservative group," McArdle said. "We're very enthusiastic, though, about our product and we think it will go a long way."
WHAT VPP IS AND WHAT IT MAY DO
* VPP stands for vegetable protein process; which both describes the protein-based molecule and the basis for the corporation's name.
* The VPP Corp. has also spun off a number of other companies to apply these scientific discoveries to a growing variety of applications.
* One of the first uses on the market has been to prevent the spoiling of fish and shellfish. Large-scale commercial trials are going on now.
* The protein process is being used to enhance filters, remove industrial pollutants, and improve both asphalt and dirt roads.
