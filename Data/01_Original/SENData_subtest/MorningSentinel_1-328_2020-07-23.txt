Opponents of Maquoit Bay expansion intend to appeal in court

BRUNSWICK — The Department of Marine Resources approved the controversial expansion of Maquoit Bay’s Mere Point Oyster Co. on Thursday, ending more than a year’s worth of debate and waiting over the 40-acre farm.
The new lease is expected to increase the company’s operating space by nearly 160 times, from roughly ¼-acre of Limited Purpose Aquaculture sites to about 40 acres of professional oyster harvesting, of which 12 acres are designated as navigable corridors. The company’s annual harvest would increase from 60,000 last year to 1.5 million in the next three years, with as many as 5 million oysters in the water at a given time.
A marathon hearing on Mere Point Oyster Co.’s proposed 10-year lease started in November 2018 and wrapped up in mid-January 2019. Waterfront property owners and lobster fishermen spoke out against what they saw as conflicting uses of the bay and the potential infringement on valuable lobstering grounds.
Two groups opposed to the expansion were granted limited intervenor status: One is a group of lobster fishermen, and the other a group of Brunswick residents, largely from Mere Point, known as both the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group and the Concerned Citizens of Maquoit Bay.
During the hearings, many witnesses expressed concern for lobstermen who previously testified that the lease would infringe upon valuable fishing grounds and result in a loss of revenue, though the department found that lobster sightings were rare during the site scoping session.
The department had 120 days to make a ruling, but according to Jeff Nichols, director of communications for the department of marine resources, it was a “more complicated lease application than normal.”
In late September, officials issued a draft approval which dismissed many of the intervenor’s concerns, including that the lease would interfere with lobstering grounds, negatively impact eelgrass beds, prevent navigation and recreation, and result in too much noise. They also found no conflict of interest with Devereaux, who is harbormaster and a former marine resources officer, because other town officials reviewed the material.
Co-owners Dan Devereaux and Doug Niven are pleased with “rational decision” from the department, Devereaux said, but despite their relief at what they see as a positive conclusion to a lengthy process, “our personal journey is far from over.”
“We have to maintain our sense of being good stewards to the ocean and good neighbors to the neighbors … We want to continue being the representatives of aquaculture that we envision ourselves to be,” he said, adding, “I think we will be scrutinized for a time to come.”
The decision, a “precedent-setting case for Maine,” will be appealed in court, said Crystal Canney, spokeswoman for the concerned citizens of Maquoit Bay.
The opposition met the “unreasonable interference criteria to have this application denied,” she said in a written statement, “but DMR favored aquaculture at the expense of the traditional fisheries.”
Canney also said that despite significant concerns, the department ignored the permitting rules (a process she called “severely broken”) and the will of the people in favor of “a wealthy aquaculture investor and Brunswick’s Harbormaster who has serious conflicts of interest in the project.”
Peter Vaughn, a member of Mere Point Preservation Group, said he was “disappointed” in the decision, “which essentially gives exclusive access to acres of ocean to those who will profit by their use or sale, while keeping away those who fish, boat or just live beside those waters.” He and others will continue to oppose the decision, he added.
Devereaux though, said he thinks the decision “is good for aquaculture and good for Maine.”
The approval is “encouraging,” he said, and while it took a long time (almost two years since the time they submitted their application, he said), the case supports how well-vetted the process is.
“The DMR is looking at every aspect and every angle,” he said. “People need to respect that process.”
He hopes the opposition will rethink their decision to appeal, but feels Mere Point Oyster Co. stands a good chance, especially given how much time and effort has been invested in making sure their application was sound.
Mere Point Oyster Co. will continue harvesting over the winter, but will not move gear to the site until the spring. Once they are settled, Devereaux thinks people will realize the site, which was often called “factory” during the hearings, is not that different from the Limited Purpose Aquaculture sites they already have.
“Change is hard, it happens over time, not overnight,” he said. “We’re excited and ready to go … I’m sure there will still be some sleepless nights, … but we’re not going away.”

Full text: By 2021, Bangs Island Mussels plans to more than double production and hire more than 10 new employees, reflecting a growing market for the Casco Bay-grown mussels.
Company hopes to more than double production, hire more than 10 new employees by 2021
A company known for bringing innovation to Maine’s aquaculture scene plans to more than double production and expand its workforce after buying nearby shellfish and kelp farms in Casco Bay.
Bangs Island Mussels, a Portland aquaculture company, says it needs to scale up its business to meet demand for its rope-grown mussels. The sale comes as Maine-farmed mussels hit a 10-year high for value and production, prompting talk of Maine-grown mussels taking market share from Canada.
“We have been a very small company for a long time. It is hard to operate as a small company when you have so many expenses,” owner Matt Moretti said in an interview.
“Particularly in aquaculture, it is not the easiest industry to operate,” Moretti added. “By growing to an appropriate scale, it just makes everything better.”
When it was founded 20 years ago, the mussel farm was believed to be the first commercial rope-grown mussel operation on the East Coast. Since then it has continued to innovate, most recently striking up a partnership with the University of New England to research the diet and stresses on mussels to better understand their growth rates and tissue quality.
Since incorporation, Bangs Island has worked the same handful of acres near Chebeague Island in Casco Bay. The company grows mussels and kelp from ropes suspended beneath rafts. The efficient system grows tens of thousands of pounds of mussels in a small space. Bangs Island produced about 266,000 pounds last year, Moretti said.
But beginning this year, Bangs Island expanded its leased leased space from 8 acres to about 23 acres in waters around Falmouth and Chebeague Island. It now farms an area roughly the size of 30 football fields.
Last winter the company bought about 4 acres of kelp farms from Ocean Approved and received state approval for an 11-acre lease in March. It bought another 5.75 acres of rope-grown mussel farms this fall from Calendar Island Mussels.
Bangs Island plans to add seven rafts to a maximum build-out of 28 by early next year and bring full production to at least 750,000 pounds a year by 2021. Moretti hopes to grow his full-time workforce from four employees to at least 15. Moretti and his father bought the company from its founder in 2010.
“We are trying to achieve a much more efficient scale,” he said. “Do what we have been doing for the last nine years, but bigger and better.”
DIVERSE BUSINESSES, SPECIES Blue mussels account for a sliver of the state’s $71.7 million aquaculture harvest, but landings and value have grown dramatically in the last decade.
In 2018, Maine blue mussel farms landed 2.1 million pounds worth $3.2 million, according to the Department of Marine Resources, more than twice the value a decade ago.
The dock value may not represent the value of mussels after they are cleaned, processed and packaged. Rope-grown mussels fetch a higher market price, about $2, than those farmed on the bottom, about $1.50, or wild-harvested, 90 cents.
Some consolidation in Maine’s growing aquaculture industry is expected, but Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, doesn’t think the Bangs Island deal indicates a trend of big companies dominating the industry. Despite its expansion, Bangs Island is still a small concern compared to big producers in Canada and elsewhere.
“I think the more important trend, frankly, is the entrance of new producers into the sector,” Belle said.
In the last decade, the state approved 79 new commercial aquaculture leases and 764 limited-purpose leases, almost seven times the limited-purpose leases given out between 2002 and 2010, according to figures provided by the marine resources department.
Limited-purpose leases are yearlong, 400-square-foot areas for people starting out in the industry. Most of the leases are for shellfish and seaweed.
“The strength of the Maine aquaculture sector is the diversity in species and company sizes,” Belle said.
“Instead of being a monolithic sector, we have a diverse one that will allow us to grow and adapt to changing circumstances in the market and in regards to climate change.”
TAKING MARKET SHARE FROM CANADA A 2016 report from the Gulf of Maine Research Institute projected Maine could become an important player in U.S. mussel cultivation.
North American demand for farmed mussels has grown in recent decades but is mainly filled by imported shellfish from Prince Edward Island in Canada. The island’s industry produces 40 million pounds of mussels a year and employs 1,500 people, according to the provincial government.
But discerning chefs and consumers prize Maine mussels because they are bigger, meatier and benefit from the state’s reputation for quality seafood, said Jonathan Labaree, chief community officer at Gulf of Maine Research Institute.
“More people are eating mussels and there is good opportunity to Maine to take some market share away from Canada,” Labaree said.
The report projects the value of Maine’s rope-harvested mussel harvest could be $15 million a year by 2030. Despite the promise of the industry, only a handful of small companies farm mussels.
Starting a rope-farmed mussel business is expensive and involves off-shore equipment and infrastructure, Labaree said. Startup farms have had a hard time getting financing from banks and other conventional lenders unfamiliar with the business and concerned with risk.
Oyster farming, is comparatively easier and cheaper to get into, Labaree said, as evidenced by the many oyster companies springing up in the last five years.
“Mussels are just a harder business to get into,” Labaree said. “I suspect we’ll see more as time goes on.”
Peter Stocks, the former owner of Calendar Island Mussels, said selling to Bangs Island was the right move for both companies.
Stocks began growing mussels around the same time Moretti bought his company and has since branched out to farming scallops. He felt it was time to focus on a single product and also for one of the companies to expand rapidly, Stocks said.
With a current two-year waiting time for state lease approval, the fastest way to scale aquaculture is to buy out existing leases, along with equipment and customers, Stocks added.
“The economics of it are such that the faster you can add on volume to your production, the sooner your costs drop and profits go up,” he said.

Full text: Researchers at the nonprofit will deploy two continuous water-quality monitoring units – in Portland Harbor and in the New Meadows area near Harpswell – to get a more holistic view of conditions in the bay.
Friends of Casco Bay to deploy water-quality monitoring units for holistic view of conditions

Researchers at Friends of Casco Bay plan to deploy two additional, 24/7 water-quality monitoring stations to better track temperature, acidity and potential marine “stressors” in a busy corner of the fast-changing Gulf of Maine.
After roughly 30 years of manually collecting and testing water samples once a month, Friends of Casco Bay launched the nonprofit’s first “continuous monitoring station” near Cousins Island in Yarmouth in 2016.
The station has collected hourly data on water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and other environmental conditions as the organization sought to build upon the “snapshot” of monthly data that was clearly showing changes in Casco Bay.
“It wasn’t enough to go out once a month. We needed to start documenting the changes we’ve been seeing,” said Mike Doan, the research associate at Friends of Casco Bay who has collected much of that data for the past two decades. “We realized we didn’t have the frequency of data to really track change. If you want to get serious about documenting change, you need frequent data.”
With three years of hourly data now on hand, Friends of Casco Bay hopes to deploy similar continuous monitoring stations in Portland Harbor and in the New Meadows area near Harpswell. Those stations could shed light on local differences in a heavily trafficked area (Portland) as well as an area that has become a prime destination for aquaculture operators (New Meadows).
“We are really looking 30 years out,” Doan said. “And hopefully we’ll have those two new stations … and then we’ll be off and running.”
In reality, Friends of Casco Bay is among more than a dozen nonprofits, universities and government agencies that monitor different conditions in a bay that stretches from Cape Elizabeth to Phippsburg. Some track fish and invertebrate populations while others monitor nutrient levels, biotoxins or the phenomenon known as “ocean acidification.”
The Casco Bay Estuary Partnership then works with and between those dozen-plus organizations to collect that data and make it available to the other groups or the public. Some of that information is then posted online through the Casco Bay Monitoring Network.
Taken together, the various monitoring programs provide a more holistic view of conditions in Casco Bay at a time when the broader Gulf of Maine is undergoing dramatic shifts as a result of the changing climate.
Zachary Whitener, a research associate who helps coordinate the Gulf of Maine Research Institute’s Casco Bay Aquatic System Survey, said the various monitoring programs complement each other as different organizations zero in on different areas.
The Portland-based Gulf of Maine Research Institute, for instance, is perhaps best known for its research on fish species and fisheries. So the institute’s Casco Bay Aquatic System Survey (CBASS, for short) has focused on documenting codfish populations in the bay, potential nonpoint pollution sources through sampling of mussels in specific areas and monitoring of species in near-shore areas.
In the latter example, Whitener and other GMRI staff or interns use 150-foot seine nets to “see who’s home” every few weeks at about a dozen area beaches. That research helps them better understand both the seasonal changes in the marine environment — such as when tomcod and juvenile pollock move out and juvenile herring and alewives move in — but also the gradual, year-over-year changes.
Equally important, Whitener said, is it gives him and other scientists a chance to engage the public in conversations about the ecology and health of Casco Bay as they see researchers documenting the fish, crabs and other critters they find.
“What’s really important about these monitoring projects that everyone is doing around Casco Bay is, not only is it valuable science, but it is a valuable way for us to interact with the public,” Whitener said. “It’s a great opportunity with this monitoring work to show the public the work that we are doing and why it is important.”
Other groups or organizations monitoring conditions in Casco Bay include the University of Maine, Bowdoin College, Southern Maine Community College, the University of New Hampshire, the Island Institute, Casco Bay Estuary Partnership, Maine Coastal Program, Maine Healthy Beaches, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Maine Department of Marine Resources and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
Friends of Casco Bay is in the initial stages of a fundraising campaign to raise money for the next two continuous monitoring stations, each of which can cost upward of $70,000 plus maintenance.
Each station is actually a modern lobster trap — or “cage of science,” as Doan calls it — that has been retrofitted to safely and securely house a “data sonde” that records various water conditions simultaneously. A separate instrument then measures carbon dioxide, which is a key concern in Maine and elsewhere as climate change causes more ocean acidification.
As humans pump more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, the world’s oceans absorb a greater share of the gas. That changes the ocean chemistry, leading to more acidic waters. And higher acidity can make it more difficult for shellfish — including lobsters and clams — to form their shells.
The three years of data collected by Friends of Casco Bay through their continuous monitoring station isn’t enough to make any decisive conclusions on changes. But the hourly data is allowing Friends of Casco Bay to more closely document the local trends as the wider Gulf of Maine heats up earlier in the year and stays warm longer.
The two additional stations will enhance that understanding of how conditions in other areas of Casco Bay are changing.
“Our goal is to track long-term change,” Doan said.

Town wants to protect clam flats

Full text: Heavy metals including lead and arsenic were found in ponds at the former base that drain into Harpswell Cove, which could potentially reach nearby clam flats.

HARPSWELL — Harpswell wants the Navy to protect the clam flats in Harpswell Cove as part of the Navy’s remediation plan for the former Brunswick Naval Air Station.
The town argues the Navy should extend its testing to the stormwater system that brings water from ponds at the former base to Mare Brook and Harpswell Cove, where shellfish are harvested.
The network of four interconnecting ponds, known as Picnic Pond, Pond A, Pond B and Pond C, is located in the northeastern corner of the former base. The pond system was constructed with a network of ditches and drains to control stormwater drainage on the base. The drains eventually meet Mare Brook in Brunswick, which flows south into Harpswell Cove.
In 2015, an investigation of the pond system found a handful of heavy metals including lead, arsenic and cadmium. If ingested, those metals can damage the nervous system, kidneys and stomach, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
“We believe the Navy has an obligation to investigate the legacy impact of the Picnic Pond stormwater system on the adjacent marine environment,” the Harpswell Conservation Commission wrote in a letter to Paul Burgio, environmental coordinator for the closure process of the former Brunswick Naval Air Station.
Efforts to reach Burgio for comment were unsuccessful.
“The Navy is not doing a complete remediation of the site,” said Mary Ann Nahf, chairwoman of the Harpswell Conservation Commission. “That pond has been the receptacle for a lot of heavy metals from the former air station. We don’t want to see it come creeping into the Harpswell side of the cove. If that closed, it would have a devastating impact to Harpswell.”
The northern tip of Harpswell Cove near the former air station is in Brunswick. The southern part of the cove is in Harpswell.
The Brunswick side of Harpswell Cove closed to shellfish harvesting after the Maine Department of Environmental Protection found traces of heavy metals including lead, cadmium and arsenic in clams from the cove, according to Paul Plummer, Harpswell’s harbormaster.
“It’ll be closed for our lifetime because of heavy metals,” said Plummer. “We don’t want that sediment to extend further south into the Harpswell side of the cove.”
The Harpswell side of Harpswell Cove alone holds $100,000 worth of shellfish, according to Plummer.
In a letter to the Harpswell Select Board, Paul Ciesielski, a geologist and member of the Harpswell Conservation Commission, wrote, “The stormwater system must be evaluated and remediated first or Brunswick will inherit a pond system that continues to receive pollutants that also discharge into Harpswell Cove.”
The Navy’s proposed plan is to remove the sediment from Ponds A and B, then apply a backfill cover. If approved, the plan will cost about $3,600. The Navy does not have a plan to remediate the stormwater drainage system.
The Navy is obligated by state and federal law to clean the site before this section of the former base is handed over to Brunswick. The Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority has overseen the conversion of the former Brunswick Naval Air Station to civilian use after the base closed in September 2011. During its heyday, the base supported the Navy’s antisubmarine warfare operations in the Atlantic Ocean and employed about 5,000 people.
The redevelopment authority operates the 3,200-acre property as Brunswick Landing.
The letters from the conservation commission and Select Board were submitted during the Navy’s 30-day public comment period for the proposed plan, which ended Nov. 8. The Navy is required by law to review the letters and all other comments received during the comment period and issue written responses.

Full text: The Gulf of Maine 2050 International Symposium is aimed at sharing the latest science on ocean acidification as well as rising sea levels and ocean temperatures while encouraging more collaboration between New England and the Canadian Maritimes.
PORTLAND — Several hundred scientists, conservationists and government leaders from New England and the Canadian Maritimes are gathering in Portland to discuss the rapid ecological changes in the Gulf of Maine and how the region should respond.
The Gulf of Maine 2050 International Symposium will focus on the science of sea level rise, ocean acidification, warming ocean waters and how those climate-related changes will affect the regional economy, environment and population over the next three decades.
“Preparing for 2050 is a major challenge, but it is one that we won’t face alone,” said Theresa Torrent of the Maine Department of Marine Resources Maine Coastal Program and the state’s coordinator on the international Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment.
“The purpose of Gulf of Maine 2050 is to activate the talents of people around the Gulf of Maine and build a safe and productive future.”
The conference — hosted by the Gulf of Maine Council, the Portland-based Gulf of Maine Research Institute and the Huntsman Marine Science Centre in St. Andrews, New Brunswick — comes at a time when New England’s waters and forests are already experiencing dramatic changes.
Another goal of the gathering, however, is to foster collaboration among states and provinces at a time when President Donald Trump is increasingly isolating the United States from the international community on climate issues.
As scientists gathered Monday at the Westin Harborview Hotel in Portland, the Trump administration followed through on its pledge to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord.
By notifying the United Nations of the its plans to withdraw from the agreement, the Trump administration is walking away from the international goals set to avoid an additional global temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius.
Speaking hours before the Trump administration’s announcement, Maine Gov. Janet Mills recalled how earlier this year her administration joined the U.S. Climate Alliance coalition of 24 states that are committed to the goals of the Paris climate accord “no matter what happens in Washington.”
Mills, who made action on climate change a cornerstone of her 2018 gubernatorial campaign, has set a goal of achieving carbon neutrality in Maine by 2045, and of reducing Maine’s greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050.
“Our administration believes in science,” Mills said during the conference’s opening remarks. “We share a love of our great state’s natural resources, outdoor recreation and coastal communities, all of which are threatened by climate change.”
While the political debate over climate change continues in some sectors, the Gulf of Maine is already experiencing significant changes.
The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than almost every other area of ocean around the globe, according research by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and other scientists. And those changes have major ecological implications.
Colder-water species such as cod are moving north or into deeper waters while warmer-water species, such as black bass, are moving into the gulf. The gulf is also becoming increasingly acidic as the ocean absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which can impede shell formation by lobsters, scallops, clams and other shellfish.
Last week, Maine fisheries regulators announced that lobster landings were down 40 percent this year compared to 2018 and down 38 percent from the five-year average. During her speech, Mills said a long-predicted end to the so-called “lobster boom” would have a “devastating” impact on Maine’s commercial fishing industry and that other Maine fisheries are threatened by acidification or invasive species.
“The antidote to this lies in climate, ocean and ocean-species science — which so many of you bring to this conference today and tomorrow — which will better form the basis of public policy that is driven by reason and research, and not rhetoric,” Mills said.
Globally, sea levels rose 3 inches between 1993 and 2017 and continue to rise at a rate of roughly one-eighth of an inch annually as glaciers melt and seawater expands thermally as it warms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That is roughly double the rate for much of the 20th century.
Additionally, global temperatures already have risen roughly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial levels. The Paris climate agreement called on member nations to work toward goals to holding future temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a level that reports from the United Nations’ International Panel on Climate Change have suggested could avoid some of the more catastrophic impacts of climate change.
Ko Barrett, a deputy assistant administrator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who has served as vice chair of International Panel on Climate Change, told Monday’s conference the world is projected to hit that 1.5-degree mark between 2030 and 2052 at the current pace. But Barrett said “the good news is we are not yet committed to a 1.5-degree world.”
“While not impossible, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees is a monumental task that would require rapid, unprecedented transitions in all aspects of society — transitions like we are seeing in the energy sector, only faster and in many different sectors simultaneously,” Barrett said.
Over the next three days, conference attendees will share their scientific research into sea level rise, ocean acidification and ocean temperature rise in the Gulf of Maine. Organizers also will be awarding “mini-grants” to research proposals that spring from conversations at the conference.
Rachel Cleetus, policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told attendees scientists must do a better job of communicating how a changing climate affects the health, lives and economics of everyday people.
Cleetus also said state action on climate change has become “a beacon of hope” amid federal inaction on the climate crisis. Addressing the bigger issues will require dramatic changes to cleaner sources in electricity generation and the transportation sector, as well as protecting the “carbon sinks,” such as forests, that lock up carbon dioxide.
“It’s going to require some pretty fundamental shifts in how we make our investments in the power sector,” Cleetus said. “And the important part here is that Maine is setting a course that will work not just for Maine, but could be an example elsewhere in the nation and globally.”

Full text: Business and education leaders call for greater efforts to offer post-secondary opportunities for students to boost their skills and credentials.
LEWISTON — For businesses, the growing shortage of qualified workers in Maine has become a problem that threatens to stifle the economy in the nation’s oldest state.
But for young people with vision, it offers an amazing opportunity, educators and company executives told students Tuesday at the Lewiston Regional Technical Center.
“The world is your oyster here in Maine,” said Deanne Sherman, chief executive officer of Dead River Co. and chairwoman of Educate Maine’s board of directors.
A number of business and education leaders who gathered to speak with students enrolled in the Bridge Academy Maine program called for investing in programs that will help high school students transition directly into college or technical programs that will prepare them for jobs.
Emma Williams, who is in her first year at the University of Maine at Farmington, said that signing up for the Bridge Academy program at Lewiston High School prepared her for college and let her rack up 26 credits before she arrived for her freshman year.
“It saved me a lot of time and money,” the aspiring teacher said.
Brian Langley, executive director of the Bridge Academy program, called Emma Williams “a concrete example” of the good it can do.
Her mother, Jen Williams, said the program provided a huge advantage for her daughter because it offered college credit and because she learned skills, such as time management and how to study properly.
It also provided her the confidence to plunge ahead, the mother said.
Jen Williams said her son, David, a junior at Lewiston, got interested in the program, too, because he saw what it had done for his sister. He plans to become an electrician after graduation.
It is “a really good fit” for her children, Williams said, and highly recommended as a way of having youngsters stay local and develop the skills to earn a living.
Sherman said the bottom line is that by 2025, if current trends hold, Maine will find itself short of 158,000 workers who have the skills or credentials to fill expected jobs in the state.
In short, she said, as the population grows ever older, “more job opportunities will be created than there are workers to fill them.”
In six years, Sherman said, the state needs to ensure that 60% of its working adults have the necessary post-high school credentials. Only 46% of them possess those skills now, a bit less than the national average, she said.
“Maine is experiencing a serious skills gap,” Langley said.
Jason Judd, executive director of Educate Maine, said the looming dearth of qualified workers “could be devastating to Maine.”
He said “forceful action” to bolster the number of people with the credentials they need is the only answer to keeping the state’s economy humming.
To hasten the required transformation, Sherman said, Maine needs programs like the Bridge Academy and The Green Ladle program in Lewiston, which teaches students everything about running a restaurant.
“It is an urgent issue,” she said, insisting Maine needs “to build a talent pool to meet our business needs.”
In a report issued Tuesday, Educate Maine said by 2025, the school and young working adult population “is projected to decline as the retiree population drastically increases.”
“The ratio of senior citizens to working adults in Maine will increase 93% by 2030,” much higher than the anticipated rise nationally, the report said.
That rapid aging, which is nearly inevitable unless Maine attracts far more immigrants than expected from other states and countries, will lead to more jobs “being created than workers to fill them.”
Langley said the Bridge Academy is a collaboration among teachers, business and academia that allows a “whole team of adults” to focus on the students participating in the program. It helps them get both the education and skills to shine on the job, he said.
Its students, he said, are prepared “for these really great-paying jobs” of the future.
Judd said workforce development programs that boost students are crucial for economic progress in Maine.
“That is the challenge of our generation,” he said.

Full text: Maine's governor meets with European climate leaders, Brazilian regional officials and other U.S. governors to discuss how states can help the nation meet Paris climate targets.
Gov. Janet Mills said that while she was at the United Nations Climate Summit on Monday she found herself standing near President Trump’s new U.N. ambassador, Kelly Kraft, and feeling the pain of foreign delegates at the meeting.
Kraft, who is married to a billionaire coal magnate Joe Crafts II of Alliance Resource Partners, has $63 million personally invested in fossil fuel interests, according to her financial disclosures, a fact Mills said she found troubling.
“To think she represents our country in the U.N. while we’re talking about climate change,” Maine’s governor said Tuesday via telephone from New York. “So you can understand other countries’ frustrations when trying to deal with the federal government and why they are looking to the states to work together to save our common planet.”
Mills, who on Monday was the only U.S. elected official to speak at the climate summit, spent Tuesday meeting with foreign officials and fellow U.S. governors on the sidelines of the meeting, looking to share ideas and best practices.
Tuesday morning she met with five high-ranking European climate officials alongside Washington Gov. Jay Inslee – a Democrat who recently withdrew from the presidential race after campaigning almost solely on climate change – and Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board.
The participants made no public statements, but Mills told the Press Herald she’d learned about Scandinavian experiences electrifying ferries and Scotland’s large offshore wind sector, while she talked about Maine’s sustainable forest practices and the floating wind platforms being developed at the University of Maine. Her spokeswoman, Lindsay Crete, said participants also reaffirmed their commitments to meet Paris Climate Accord goals and had discussed “trying to raise global ambitions” ahead of the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, where 30,000 delegates will meet in another attempt to craft an international response to the climate crisis.
The European delegation consisted of three top European Union officials: Olva Elvestuen, the E.U. minister for climate and the environment; Maura Petriccione, director general of the European Commission’s Climate Action Directorate; and Miguel Arias Canete, E.U. commissioner for energy and climate action. The United Kingdom’s special envoy for climate, Nick Bridge, and Anders Hoffman, an official at Denmark’s Climate, Energy, and Utilities Ministry, also attended the meeting, which was held at the offices of the E.U.’s diplomatic delegation to the U.N.
The meeting was convened by the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 states and Puerto Rico that seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accord with the Paris climate treaty that was created after President Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in 2017. Maine did not join the group until Feb. 28 of this year, after Mills replaced Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who did not favor robust action on climate change.
Crete said E.U. officials at the meeting had “expressed gratitude” to their American counterpart for creating the U.S. Climate Alliance, saying the “coalition of states was a powerful force despite the lack of action out of the White House.”
Mills said she also met Tuesday with counterparts from some of the northeastern states of Brazil who, like her, oppose the backpedaling on climate by their federal government. Like Trump, Brazil’s new leader, Jair Bolsonaro, does not consider climate change a priority; he is accused of tacitly encouraging the recent fires in the Amazon rain forest, which he would like to see opened to development.
On Monday, Mills was the only U.S. elected official to address the U.N. general Assembly’ at the Climate Action Summit, and announced she had signed an executive order directing the Maine Climate Council — a body she created with legislative approval — to provide recommendations on how to make the state a carbon neutral economy by 2045, an initiative that follows previous recent commitments to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades.
From the podium, she told world leaders that Maine will not wait to take bold action to address climate change and challenged them to do the same. “We’ve got to unite to preserve our precious common ground, for our common planet, in uncommon ways for this imperative common purpose,” she said. “Maine won’t wait. Will you?”
Mills said it had been “exciting just to be in the General Assembly room” speaking to delegates from around the world. “I felt very privileged to be there and honored that the State of Maine could be represented on the world stage.”
Mills attended another U.S. Climate Alliance event Tuesday afternoon: a panel discussion with five other Democratic governors on how states can address climate change. She was scheduled to appear alongside her counterparts from California (Gavin Newsom), Washington (Inslee), New Mexico (Michele Grisham), Virginia (Ralph Northam) and New Jersey (Phil Murphy).
The governor was scheduled to speak Tuesday evening in New York at the premier of a documentary film on how climate change is adversely affecting shellfish growers. The film, “Stories From the Shore,” was produced by the Nature Conservancy and the Shellfish Growers Climate Coalition, an alliance of dozens of shellfish mariculture operators seeking action on climate change.
Maine is at the forefront of climate change because the Gulf of Maine is the second fastest-warming part of the entire world’s oceans. The rapid warming, a side effect of climate change and the Arctic meltdown, is expected to have dramatic effects on the marine ecosystem and the communities that rely on it and is already adversely effecting clammers, aquaculture operations and the recovery of cod stocks.

Plenty of hope in fight against climate change

Full text: For the past week, this newspaper has run articles as part of the Covering Climate Now project, an international effort by more than 220 news outlets to highlight the issues surrounding climate change in advance of Monday’s United Nations Climate Summit.
Taken together, they show what climate change will cost us in the near future if there is no significant response, and how it is affecting us already today — in Maine and around the world. They show what that response could look like.
But most of all, the stories from the Covering Climate Now project show us that the situation is not hopeless — that despite the shortcomings of the response so far, and despite the roadblocks put in place by cynicism and ignorance, there is a clear path forward against the threat of climate change.
As part of the project, reporters from the Portland Press Herald contributed pieces focused on Maine, a bellwether of sorts on climate change. The Gulf of Maine, stretching from Cape Cod to the southern tip of Cape Sable in Nova Scotia, is the second fastest-warming area of the world ocean, giving scientists a look at how other areas will react as climate change intensifies.
As staff writer Colin Woodard reported, a heat wave six years ago in the Gulf of Maine brought hordes of invasive green crabs, killing off mussels and soft-shell clams. Puffin chicks and right whales lost their food supply. Lobsters shed early, causing turmoil in the markets.
It’s clear already that rising water temperatures and increasing ocean acidification caused by climate change are disrupting the ecosystem of the Gulf of Maine, affecting seabirds, whales, shellfish and plant life. The heart of the lobster industry is moving north. Maine’s island and coastal communities are already feeling the effect of the changes, and more severe consequences are yet to come. Inland, the increase in tick-borne disease is just one way climate change is making its presence felt.
The certainty that these sort of effects will be seen around the world — indeed, they are already apparent in many places — should be enough to spur action. Rising temperatures and other effects from climate change will bring droughts and change regional agriculture, causing famine, upending traditions and forcing mass migrations. They will make people sicker through increases in heart and lung disease and the spread of infectious disease.
At Monday’s UN climate summit, countries will be presenting plans aimed at meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which is focused on keeping global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels, a generally agreed-upon, but by no means perfect, tipping point.
President Donald Trump announced in 2017 he would pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2020, the earliest possible date that could be accomplished. Trump also is fighting the strict auto emissions standards put in place in California and followed by other states.
In short, he has shown no interest in the addressing the issue, and in fact has buried climate science across federal government.
However, Maine Gov. Janet Mills has shown what is possible when you have a chief executive and legislators committed to taking on climate change. In her first legislative session, after eight years of inaction under Gov. Paul LePage, Mills passed a bill committing the state to sharply reducing the carbon emissions responsible for climate. She recently named a 35-member climate council that will develop plans to meet those goals, and monitor rising water temperatures and ocean acidification.
On Monday, Mills is scheduled to address the UN conference in New York City.
That is the kind of leadership that the youngest generations are seeking as they make climate change a central issue. In Maine and around the world, young people, frustrated by inaction, are demanding that leaders take climate change seriously. On Friday, students from elementary age up to college organized “climate strikes” throughout the country, including here in Maine, that drew hundreds of thousands of participants.
These youths are sending a message that they won’t be brushed off. With any luck, such activism will force world leaders to respond in the way necessary to meet this critical threat.

She will be Maine’s first sitting governor to speak before the international body’s General Assembly.

Gov. Janet Mills will speak before the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday about Maine’s efforts to respond to climate change, becoming the first sitting Maine governor to address the international body.
The Democratic governor was invited to speak by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Mills’ office said Friday. She will deliver two minutes of remarks about her administration’s new action plan, which calls for an 80% reduction in the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; jump-starting renewable energy; and assessing and addressing sea level rise, ocean acidification and other impacts.
“This is a global threat that all states and all countries must confront together, and Maine will do its part,” Mills told the Press Herald in an email. “I look forward to standing before leaders of the world, sharing Maine’s significant achievements, and calling upon our national and international neighbors to step up and do their part in this critical fight for our future.”
Environmental groups are pleased the governor will be taking her message to the global stage. “We think it’s fantastic, and she’s earned a place on that platform,” said Pete Didisheim, advocacy director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine, one of the state’s most influential environmental groups. “She’s made it clear she’s beyond just talk and that she’s about action and action based on science.”
Kate Dempsey, state director for The Nature Conservancy in Maine said her organization was pleased Mills was being recognized “as a national and global leader” on climate change. “The future of Maine’s communities and our natural places depends on moving toward a low-carbon future,” she said in a statement.
Mills’ remarks will take place amid the U.N. Climate Action Summit 2019, which is intended to bring government, private sector and international organizations together to develop aggressive plans to respond to the climate change threat.
Mills will remain in New York on Tuesday and meet with European Union officials to look for ways that the United States can work with European governments on climate issues. Later, she will join a panel discussion with five other Democratic governors to discuss state-level action to reduce U.S. greenhouse emissions in accordance with the Paris Climate Accord. President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris agreement.
Tuesday evening, Mills will deliver opening remarks at the premiere of a short documentary film, “Shellfish Growers Changing the Game on Climate,” which features Maine oyster hatchery owner Bill Mook, who had to adapt his operations to cope with one of the side effects of climate change, ocean acidification.
Mills signed a climate action bill into law June 26 that requires Maine to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 45% below 1990 levels by 2030 and by at least 80% by 2050.
It created a 35-member Maine Climate Council tasked with developing specific plans to meet these goals, as well as monitoring the effects of ocean acidification, warming ocean temperatures, and changes in the salt and dissolved oxygen content of the gulf, an expected side effect of warming. The council — co-chaired by Hannah Pingree, director of governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, and Jerry Reid, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection — will have its first meeting Thursday in Hallowell.
“Climate change threatens all that we hold dear in Maine, from our fisheries, to our forests, to the very future of our beautiful state. With Washington’s failure to act, it’s now up to states like Maine to fight climate change head-on,” Mills said in the statement emailed to the Press Herald. “And we will not wait.”
Maine is at the forefront of climate change because the Gulf of Maine is the second fastest-warming part of the entire world ocean. The rapid warming, a side effect of climate change and the Arctic meltdown, is expected to have dramatic effects on the marine ecosystem and the communities that rely on it and is already adversely affecting clammers, aquaculture operations, and the recovery of cod stocks.
Former Maine Gov. Edmund S. Muskie spoke before the United Nations General Assembly while serving as Secretary of State in the Carter Administration, to rebuke the Soviet Union for its occupation of Afghanistan.

Full text: Portland has gained a national reputation as a city with great restaurants. What will be on the menu in 50 years if we do nothing to slow down climate change?

Ask Sam Hayward, co-owner and founding chef of Fore Street, what the famed Portland restaurant might be serving 50 years from now, and he obligingly jumps into an imaginary time capsule to visit 2069 and check out the menu.
The question assumes that little has been done since 2019 to put the brakes on climate change. It’s likely, Hayward says, that diners at his restaurant would be feasting on black sea bass, a mid-Atlantic species that already has started moving north into Gulf of Maine waters, or local meat raised on abundant Maine pastureland.
“As wild species become more threatened, fish farming will continue to grow, and shellfish farming will grow,” Hayward said. “So you’ll see even more bivalves on the menu, and possibly even some southern species, such as warm-water shrimp, being grown in different places. That’s hard to imagine, isn’t it?”
Farmers and fishermen are used to dealing with the vicissitudes of Mother Nature, but unchecked climate change may push her finicky personality into overdrive. Dramatic fluctuations in temperature and rainfall, increasingly acidic oceans, new plant and shellfish diseases and insect pests — all of these may challenge traditional notions of what farmers can grow in Maine and how they grow it, and what fishermen harvest from the sea. Even the smaller aspects of daily life — such as what you order off a menu — may look vastly different 50 years from now.
Chefs and scientists agree that they would need an actual crystal ball to be sure which meats, fish and vegetables will thrive and which will disappear as climate change transforms the planet. Climate change is a complex issue, and no one knows for certain how plants and animals will respond. For example, scientific models predict a general decline in groundfish such as cod, halibut, haddock and flounder, “but I think there’s some potential that haddock will fare better in the future just because they have these big (population) booms,” said Kathy Mills, a research scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute.
That means that in 2069, you may still be able to order a cup of your favorite fish chowder. But you might not be able to follow it up with the most iconic of Maine foods — a lobster. Lobster populations are at a historic high, but scientists warn that as the Gulf of Maine continues to warm, the population will decline, perhaps substantially. Lobster may be a splurge you save for birthdays and anniversaries.
“They’ll be much more of a luxury item, I think, if current trends continue,” Hayward said.
As the climate warms, Mainers likely will say goodbye to some familiar foods and learn to incorporate others into their diets. Cod won’t appear on your dinner plate unless it is flown in from Norway or Iceland. Acadian redfish, whose populations are thriving, or squid from southern New England waters may take its place. Beef, pork and lamb probably won’t disappear from restaurant menus, but could be locally raised or grown in a laboratory to avoid the big carbon footprint of factory farms (why we’re already being urged to eat less meat). Don’t worry about your Sunday brunch of blueberry pancakes slathered in maple syrup, with a side of hash browns. Blueberries, maple syrup and potatoes — all traditional Maine foods — probably aren’t going anywhere in the next 50 years, according to agricultural experts. (After that, we’ll need a bigger crystal ball.)
Before diving into menus, David Levi, chef/owner of Vinland, suggests asking which Portland neighborhoods will even have restaurants in 50 years. Parts of the city could be underwater because of sea level rise.
“If you’re making a reservation for Central Provisions in 2069, make sure you wear a wet suit,” Levi said. “Your galoshes might suffice for Vinland.”
Levi believes that in 50 years, the country will have less access to food from California and Latin America, areas expected to be ravaged by drought and fire, so Americans will be eating more seasonal, local foods. Maine is in a good position for that shift since we have a flourishing organic farming movement, he said.
“We’re already seeing some cutting-edge permaculture, growing things in Maine that people thought we couldn’t grow 20 or 30 years ago,” he said, citing figs and kiwis.
Mark Hutton, vegetable specialist and associate director of the Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station in Orono, adds to that list foods such as baby ginger, sweet potatoes and artichokes, which are traditionally found in coastal California and Texas but are now being grown in Maine. But he says that improved farming techniques and farmers’ desire to develop new markets have more to do with the success of those unconventional crops than climate change. Climate, he said, “is probably not going to change what we grow. It may change when we grow it, or particularly when we can harvest it.
“Maybe we’ll be like Pennsylvania, where we have field tomatoes maturing in July rather than the end of August,” he said.
Hutton doesn’t think that any vegetable crops will disappear from Maine by 2069, but they may be more expensive to grow, primarily because of sharp fluctuations in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, and the challenges of dealing with new diseases and insect pests.
The same holds true for potatoes and blueberries. Those mashed potatoes on your plate at Fore Street will probably still come from Maine, but they may be a variety of potato that is less climate sensitive. And growing them may require irrigation or other costly special treatments, says Ellen Mallory, a professor of sustainable agriculture at the University of Maine. “We can adapt,” Mallory said. “The thing I feel like is (a challenge) is the increase in variability of the weather.
“We’ve already seen a dramatic increase in heavy precipitation. The number of extreme rainfall events has increased 74 percent since the 1950s. It’s hard to predict the specific impacts, but we know that just makes the farmers’ job harder.”
Blueberries are resilient plants, so you’ll still be able to order a big, juicy slice of blueberry pie for dessert, according to Lily Calderwood, a wild blueberry specialist and an assistant professor of horticulture at the University of Maine. Over the past 30 years, with spring arriving earlier and fall later, the wild blueberry growing season has been extended by about four weeks, she said. And fewer late spring frosts Down East mean that blueberries grow more reliably in fields north of Route 9, Calderwood said.
But like farmers growing vegetable crops, blueberry growers will be fighting new pests and may have to install irrigation systems to fight drought and plump up berries before harvest.
As for maple syrup, it’s true that sugar maples in southern parts of the state may lose ground to species such as red oak and white pine. And smaller maple producers may decide that year-to-year fluctuations in production aren’t worth it anymore, said Andy Whitman, director of the sustainable economies program at Manomet in Brunswick. But he thinks the trees still will be abundant in northern Maine, where the big commercial operations are located. “There will still be significant maple production in Maine,” Whitman said. “It may not be as strong as it is now.”
The beer and wine lists at Maine restaurants in 2069 will feature more beverages made in Maine, experts predicted.
Levi’s wish list for new foods to grow in a warmer Maine includes wine grapes, perhaps the varieties now grown in the cooler wine regions of Europe, places like the Alsace region of France or the Mosel Valley in Germany. But, he added, “I don’t think Maine is going to become Tuscany.”
A more Mediterranean-like climate means that the olive oil you dip your focaccia in might be made from Maine olives, another crop on Levi’s wish list.
Climate change may mean more local grain in Maine’s fields, in turn craft brewers making a greater variety of truly local beer. To see the future, look no farther than the Upper Midwest — Minnesota, North Dakota and far eastern Montana — where the barley line is moving northward at roughly five miles per year, according to Chris Swersey, supply chain specialist at the Brewers Association in Boulder, Colorado. “I would say it’s highly likely that barley will move its way north into Maine” in greater volume, he said.
The news is more alarming when it comes to the seafood. Scientists say the Gulf of Maine is heating up faster than 99 percent of the global oceans. Climate change already has been blamed, in part, for the disappearance of Maine’s mussels and shrimp. Species like cod, which are sensitive to temperature change, are moving to colder waters.
Fishermen and scientists have reported mid-Atlantic species moving northward. Some of those fish could make for good eating, but they also include invasive species such as green crabs. Black sea bass, a firm whitefish common in the waters off New Jersey, are already being pulled up in Maine lobster traps, said Mills, the scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, adding, “I’ve caught them off of Rhode Island, and they’re great to eat.”
Longfin squid have been spotted in waters off the Maine coast, too, Mills said, but not near the shore, so fishermen have not targeted them. During a heat wave in 2012, however, squid moved in closer and stayed there for most of the summer. A small fishery sprang up to take advantage.
Maine may follow in the footsteps of Point Judith in Rhode Island — once a groundfish port, but now primarily a place to catch squid. “It’s sort of the squid capital of the East Coast,” Mills said, “and there’s obviously a large calamari market.”
Experts say that how well we adapt to the impact climate change has on our food systems will depend largely on us as consumers — how flexible we are, and how willing to make changes in our diets. Mainers, Mills said, may have to develop a taste for oily fish like bluefish and mackerel, and Maine chefs will have to learn to prepare it well.
So that’s 50 years. What will the next 100 years bring? A sterile ocean? Collapsed food chains? Drought and starvation? How our great-grandchildren eat a century from now will depend on how seriously we take climate change today.

Full text: For eight years, state government did little to deal with the impacts of a warming Gulf of Maine. That's starting to change.
AUGUSTA — After years of inaction, Maine’s government is finally tackling the rapid warming of the Gulf of Maine.
The Gulf of Maine is the second fastest-warming part of the entire world ocean, a side effect of climate change and the Arctic meltdown, with dramatic implications for life on the Maine coast. As the crisis has unfolded, Maine’s government has avoided taking action that would help the state understand and prepare for the impacts, including ocean acidification, a potentially catastrophic threat to Maine’s marine harvesters.
That has changed suddenly with the end of the eight-year administration of Gov. Paul LePage, who dismissed the scientific evidence that human activity is driving climate change, and the Democratic takeover of the Blaine House and both chambers of the state Legislature this past January.
Gov. Janet Mills has made addressing climate change a pillar of her administration, and in June she secured passage of aggressive legislation to reduce Maine’s greenhouse gas emissions, jumpstart renewable energy, and assess and address sea level rise, ocean acidification, and other impacts.
“We strongly support what the governor is doing,” says Ivy Frignoca of the Friends of Casco Bay, who has been helping lead an ad hoc group of scientists, environmentalists and others who worked to respond to the ocean acidification challenge when state officials would not. “There’s a strong recommendation in the bill to look at how climate change is impacting the oceans and how important it is to focus on remediation and adaptation.”
The climate bill, which Mills signed into law June 26, requires Maine to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and by at least 80 percent by 2050. It created a 35-member Maine Climate Council tasked with developing specific plans to meet these goals, as well as monitoring the effects of ocean acidification, warming ocean temperatures, and changes in the salt and dissolved oxygen content of the gulf, an expected side effect of warming. It holds its inaugural meeting later this month.
Ocean acidification is one of the more serious challenges facing the gulf, a problem tied to the increased carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere, which are more than 70 percent higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution. The levels would be worse but for the fact that the oceans absorb some of that additional CO2, but that has caused them to become 30 percent more acidic over this period, a condition that interferes with the chemical processes by which clams, oysters and other organisms grow their shells.
Acidification has been implicated in failures at Maine oyster hatcheries and mussel farms, and has been shown to weaken clams and other shell-building animals vital to the state’s fishing and aquaculture industries. Nearly 90 percent of the value of Maine’s commercial fish catch comes from such creatures.
Four years ago, Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, told legislators the future of his industry was at stake. Now he’s relieved Maine government is finally taking action.
“Mills deserves a great deal of credit for taking what can be a controversial subject and taking a practical approach to it, trying not to have it become a hyperbolic political football,” Belle says.
Under LePage, scientists and conservationists concerned about the issue made the strategic decision to deal with it separately, so that it wouldn’t get sucked into the political – and highly partisan – war over climate change.
“‘Climate change’ was a dirty term politically in Maine, and people didn’t think it was real or didn’t want to react to it,” says Aaron Strong, a marine and climate policy researcher who helped lead the volunteer group of scientists and environmentalists who tried to respond to the threat, the Maine Ocean and Coastal Acidification Partnership. “Now the calculus is different,” he says, and backs the Mills administration’s decision to fold ocean acidification into the Climate Council’s work.
The administration will officially launch the council – whose members include the commissioners of most government departments – Sept. 26 in Augusta. The council and its subcommittees will start meeting in October and will begin drawing up its final plan next summer, ahead of the statutory deadline of Dec. 1, 2020, said Hannah Pingree, who co-chairs the council and directs the governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future.
“Maine is behind a lot of other states, but we are trying to catch up,” Pingree says.
Julie Rabinowitz, LePage’s former spokeswoman and the head of his political organization, Maine People Before Politics, did not respond to a request for comment from the former governor.
Under President Trump, the federal government has shied away from substantive action on climate issues. Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate change accord – the primary mechanism by which the world’s nations have tried to respond – and he has repeatedly attempted to eliminate funding for many of the key programs that support Gulf of Maine climate initiatives, including Maine Sea Grant, the National Estuarine Research Reserves Program and the Environmental Protection Agency’s National Estuaries Program.
The U.S. House of Representatives, which the Democrats control, passed a bill on June 5 pushed by 1st District Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, that directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the likely impacts of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge.
More than three months later, the Senate version of the bill remains in limbo, despite being introduced by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and co-sponsored by Maine’s Susan Collins, also a Republican, and independent Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats.

Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, that directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the likely impacts of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge.
More than three months later, the Senate version of the bill remains in limbo, despite being introduced by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and co-sponsored by Maine’s Susan Collins, also a Republican, and independent Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats.

Full text: The melting Arctic and warming poles are changing the currents that feed Maine’s sea, with massive implications for life and livelihoods on the coast.
FREEPORT — From the one-lane bridge over the Little River at low water, you can see men hunched over the mudflats, hundreds of yards from shore, flipping the sea bottom with their pitchfork-like hoes to reveal the clams hiding there.
The clams, the basis of livelihood for generations of diggers from Cape Porpoise to Lubec, are back, at least for now, their numbers slowly recovering from a climate-driven disaster that will almost certainly strike again.
Six years ago, after the Gulf of Maine warmed to unprecedented levels, green crabs flooded over these northern embayments of Casco Bay like a plague of locusts, tearing away seagrass meadows, pockmarking salt marshes with their burrows, and devouring most every mussel and soft-shell clam in their path.
Farther out to sea, puffin chicks starved and right whales abandoned their summer grounds for lack of food. Fishermen began hauling up southern creatures such as black sea bass and Maryland blue crabs. Lobsters shed so early they flooded the market, setting off a chain of events that resulted in angry Canadian lobstermen blockading New Brunswick processing plants to prevent the unloading of lobster trucks from Maine.
The Gulf of Maine is the second fastest-warming portion of the world’s oceans, a vast laboratory for ocean scientists studying how global warming affects the marine environment and for policymakers trying to figure out how to minimize the damage to fisheries, communities or, as in the case of the 2012 lobster glut, civic peace. Their discoveries underscore the seriousness of the changes and the complexity of the required policy responses.
“We’re trying to go from being reactive to being proactive, so we can get ahead of these events rather than sit back and wait for them to unfold,” says Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, who has been at the forefront of tracking the rapid warming of the gulf.
Since the record-breaking heat wave of 2012-13, the Gulf of Maine has continued sea surface temperature years on record in 2016 and 2018. Researchers have also learned that the whole while, even during cooler years at the surface, the depths of the gulf have been steadily warming — due, almost certainly, to the ongoing meltdown of Greenland and the Arctic, which is altering the interplay of the deep ocean currents that feed what has been one of the most productive marine environments on Earth.
“The surface waters tend to respond quickly to whatever is going on in the atmosphere and change from year to year, but the deep waters take far more energy and time to change, so they’re a really good indicator of what is going on,” says Nick Record, an oceanographer at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay. “If you see something getting a lot warmer down there, it’s a lot more likely to stay.”
To understand why the Gulf of Maine is so vulnerable to climate change, it’s important to know what it is and how it works. It’s nearly a sea of its own, extending from Cape Cod in Massachusetts to Cape Sable at the southern tip of Nova Scotia, including the Bay of Fundy, and the coast of Maine, its connections with the open Atlantic to the south nearly blocked by two shallow plateaus, Georges Bank and Browns Bank.
Two narrow channels provide the only deep-water connections into the gulf. The larger of these, the Northeast Channel, is only 22 miles wide, but through it often flows a cold, nutrient-rich current originating among the ice floes of northern Labrador. It courses around the end of Nova Scotia and spins around the gulf in a giant, life-sustaining gyre that — together with the gulf’s myriad rivers, staggering tides, and island- and peninsula-studded coastlines — mix the ocean, keeping life-giving nutrients near the surface where light sustains the microscopic plants at the base of its oversize food chain.
But the deep currents entering the Northeast Channel haven’t been as cold of late, as the melting Arctic and Greenland ice sheet have altered ocean currents and helped cause Atlantic Ocean circulation to slow by 15% since the mid-20th century. Recent oceanographic studies have found the Gulf Stream is shifting northward, carrying more warm water to the Gulf of Maine than climate models have generally predicted.
Warming on the scale of 5.4 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 80 years in the Gulf of Maine “will cause more extreme effects on the ecosystem” than previously anticipated, concluded an influential 2016 study led by Vincent Saba of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.
In April 2018, researchers working from the Canadian Coast Guard cutter Hudson recorded temperatures exceeding 57 degrees at depths of 150 to 450 feet — nearly 11 degrees above normal for that time of year and the highest seen in 15 years of surveys. In the two cruises since, the temperatures have been lower but still well above the averages of the 30-year period from 1981 to 2010, according to research scientist David Hebert of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, a Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans facility in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.
“It’s like there are these eddies of warm, Gulf Stream-influenced water coming in through the channel in pulses,” Hebert says, because the cold water currents that normally dominate the passage have weakened.
All that warm water flooding into the gulf’s deep basins is implicated in the catastrophic wave of deaths that have pushed the endangered North Atlantic right whale back to the brink of extinction. At least 25 of the whales have died over the past three years, reducing the worldwide population to just 411. Most appear to have been struck by ships or entangled in fishing gear after leaving their feeding grounds, where protection measures had been in place.
Why did they move? Record, of the Bigelow lab, found this year that the warmer water in the eastern gulf’s deep basins has sharply reduced their food supply: the tiny flealike copepod Calanus finmarchicus, which they scoop up by the millions with their sieve-like baleen. The warm water, he and his colleagues found, caused the copepods — which hibernate in the deep basins in winter — to decline by as much as 90%, leaving the whales’ summer feeding grounds off Lubec and Grand Manan Island effectively barren. (Disclosure: This reporter is a Bigelow trustee.)
More worrisome, Calanus isn’t just important to whales; it’s a keystone species for the entire gulf ecosystem, providing food for herring, mackerel, the larval stages of cod and redfish, and, in turn, everything that eats any of those creatures.
“If the Gulf of Maine loses Calanus or it declines significantly, that’s when we really lose the sub-polar ecosystem that has characterized the gulf for centuries,” Pershing says. “An ecosystem that has Calanus in it is likely to have cod and herring and whales and all the other things that make a rich ecosystem.”
Fortunately, the Calanus declines are thus far limited to the eastern gulf. In Cape Cod Bay and the western part of the gulf — where right whales still come in large numbers in the spring — copepod numbers have remained strong, because the populations there are not as dependent on seasonal hibernation.
Meanwhile, at the surface, the gulf has continued to see lots of distressingly hot years, many of them the result of changes in the jet stream, the shifting front between cold arctic and temperate continental air masses that determines much about New England’s weather.
“As the Arctic’s atmosphere is heating up it is reducing the gradient, and that slows down the jet stream,” says Glen Gawarkiewicz, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who helped track the phenomenon. “It’s been having these big meanders and sometimes just gets stuck in one position for weeks at a time.”
That can give northern New England weeks of unusually warm or cold weather, depending on where the jet stream has decided to plant itself. This, Gawarkiewicz says, drove the unusually warm winter of 2011-2012, when people in Quebec City walked around in T-shirts in January. It also set the stage for the “ocean heat wave” of 2012, because the upper layers of the Gulf never properly cooled down, and came out of the winter about 4 degrees warmer than usual.
A similar stall, he notes, could set the stage for another year like 2012.
When surface waters get too warm, puffins are among the first to suffer. Like so many of the gulf’s creatures, the birds are at the southern end of their range, and warmer water drives their cold-loving prey deeper than they can dive. Adults can move but not during breeding season, when they protect their nests and feed hatchlings at places like Eastern Egg Rock, east of Pemaquid, or Machias Seal Island, off Jonesport. If the food fails, the chicks starve.
The seabird scientists who study and help protect the puffin colonies have recorded a clear pattern: In years when the sea surface temperatures are cool — like this year — the chicks do well. When they’re warm, they’re devastated, as in 2016, when only 12% of chicks survived at the gulf’s largest colony, Machias Seal Island, compared to 68% in 2017, a more moderate temperature year.
Warm surface waters also threaten the North Atlantic’s largest kelp forest, which covers the summit and ridges of a submerged mountain 80 miles southeast of Portland called Cashes Ledge, and shelters fish at a density 50 times that of typical coastal sites. When water gets into the high 60s, the kelp fronds and leaves start falling apart, Brown University biologist Jon Witman told the Press Herald in December.
Climate change has aquaculture firms on edge as well, as it has brought more frequent rainfall, which sets off chains of events that make bays and estuaries more acidic — which can damage developing shells and fish gills — and appears to trigger algae blooms with unexpected properties.
“We’ve heard more from our members in the last five years about changing environmental conditions and climate change than we have ever heard in the history of our organization,” says Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association.
Bill Mook, owner of Mook Sea Farm, an oyster hatchery in South Bristol, was so concerned about the rise in algal blooms that he’s invested nearly $3 million in a new, land-based facility where he can hold live oysters and protect them from pathogens and the increasingly frequent harvesting closures. He thinks the problem will become so acute for the industry that his firm is also now growing commercial quantities of the microscopic algae oyster larvae eat, which he expects to sell to other hatcheries.
“We’ve made a bet that as climate and environmental change continue on the predicted path, there will be a greater demand for the technologies we’ve had to develop,” Mook says. “The trends are increasing.”
But few people are more vulnerable than wild clam harvesters, who have seen their harvests battered when conditions warm and green crabs, milky ribbon worms and other invertebrate predators thrive.
Maine’s overall soft-shell clam harvest has fallen from nearly 34 million pounds in 1950 to just 7 million in 2018. In Freeport, at the epicenter of the 2013 green crab explosion, the harvest fell from 939,695 pounds to 289,775 from 2012 and 2015 but crept back up to 522,961 last year.
Marine ecologist Brian Beal of the Downeast Institute and University of Maine at Machias is now certain that warmth-loving predators are the central challenge. He’s discovered that if you protect a section of mudflats from predators — for instance, covering it with a fine mesh that lets planktonic clam larvae settle on the mud but prevents baby crabs and worms from getting in — it grows staggering quantities of clams, even in areas diggers have written off for decades as “dead mud.”
“This has drawn back the curtain for us in terms of understanding what is happening in this ecosystem,” Beal explains, noting that baby clams are eaten up by baby crabs just a few millimeters wide, and have gone unnoticed. Bottom line: “These flats could produce lots of clams if we had fewer green crabs.”
For now, clams around Freeport and Brunswick have been recovering from the 2013 adult green crab invasion, and the area’s seagrass meadows have regrown in many locations. “Because the water quality is so good in these areas, Casco Bay’s seagrasses have proven to be really resilient,” says Hilary Neckles of the United States Geological Survey, who documented the collapse.
“The clams are definitely on the mend,” says Daniel Devereaux, who was Brunswick’s marine resource patrol officer for 22 years until becoming the town’s coastal resource manager in June, “as long as we can keep the green crabs at bay.”

WATERVILLE — Despite the day’s rainy start, 450 cyclists from around the country flocked to Head of Falls on Saturday to enjoy lawn games, tenting, food and drinks for the start of the seventh annual BikeMaine event.
The event, which was founded by the Bicycle Coalition of Maine, began at 10 a.m. when cyclists began checking in at the park on Front Street. A day packed with events ensued to help kick off the week’s festivities, which involves riders traveling 324.6 miles around midcoast Maine and back.
The cyclists, 339 of whom are from out of state, will take off on their six-day excursion this morning. They will roll through 35 communities and are set to return to Head of Falls for a celebratory lunch at noon on Sept. 14.
But even with Saturday’s gloomy weather, Will Elting, the ride’s director, was still overjoyed about how the day was unfolding.
“Of course we’re stoked that it finally stopped raining but despite that we’re still here welcoming all the cyclists and making sure they’re ready for the week,” Elting said. “We have 85 L.L. Bean tents set up, we’re checking everyone in. We’re all so excited to be here.”
Elting expressed that his excitement about this year’s event specifically has to do with his own personal connection to Waterville and the changes he’s seen to the RiverWalk.
“I went to Unity College and my wife went to Colby so it’s special to be in Waterville for the event,” Elting said. “Especially seeing the transformation of Head of Falls, it’s remarkable. I remember I came to a concert here a while ago and it was just a dirt lot, the park is incredible now.”
BikeMaine is one of the first events to be held at Head of Falls since its $1.5 million revitalization project wrapped last October.
Throughout its seven-year run, BikeMaine has garnered a high number of repeat riders. Jeff and Sara Sloan, of Bethel, and Paul Vinsel, of West Bath, were just three of the 249 return riders that were present on Saturday and will be participating in this week’s trip.
According to Jeff’s Sloan, who’s now ridden in four BikeMaine routes, the event and the company behind it are what keeps him coming back year after year.
“The Bicycle Coalition of Maine is just an incredible organization,” Jeff Sloan said. “And the event is amazing. It’s like a brand new adventure every time, no matter what age you are you feel 19 again on these rides.”
Vinsel, who’s riding his second BikeMaine route this week, said he loves the event because of the experiences it provides to its participants.
“It (BikeMaine) immerses you in the culture and industry of the communities you’re riding through,” Vinsel said. “It gives you a taste of how the people in that area live their lives … this year I hope to learn a lot about the oyster and lobster industries since we’re riding through the midcoast.”
Once all the cyclists checked in by 5 p.m., volunteers from multiple local organizations and businesses served the crowd a hot meal, all of which was cooked by Waterville public schools.
Additionally, organizers planned a beer and wine garden for attendees and a free concert by The Crown Vics, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at the amphitheatre at Head of Falls.
Each year, the Bicycle Coalition of Maine chooses a new theme to showcase the people, places, food and culture of Maine.
Waterville was chosen as a key location for this year’s event for a number of reasons, according to Eliza Cress, communications director for the Bicycle Coalition of Maine.
“Each year, we go through a different region of Maine, and we hadn’t been here (Waterville) before,” Cress said. “The city’s proximity to the midcoast and the fact that Colby College is here made it a great choice. The city has the capacity to handle the event.”
The other communities that will host riders are in Knox, Lincoln and Waldo counties. The route includes landmarks such as the Two Cent Bridge that crosses from Waterville to Winslow, the Matthew Museum of Maine Heritage in Unity and the Rockport Opera House.
Proceeds from BikeMaine support the Bicycle Coalition of Maine and its continuing advocacy for walkers and bikers in the state. The coalition works to improve bicycling and walking conditions in Maine’s communities and advocates for changes that protect the rights and safety of those who walk and bike.

Suspect arrested Wednesday after attempted break-in at Maine Historical Society

A Portland man arrested Wednesday after a break-in attempt at the Maine Historical Society has now been charged with a string of burglaries in the downtown area during the last several weeks.
The additional charges against Tim Toun, 30, were revealed during an initial court appearance Friday afternoon. Toun was ordered held on $50,000 bail.
Portland police said they believe Toun is responsible for nine recent burglaries or burglary attempts, including at the historical society. Toun, whose criminal history includes theft, confessed to breaking into the business and told police he is homeless, needed cash and has a drug problem, court records state.
Toun did not enter a plea and spoke only when the judge asked if he was Tim Toun.
“Tim claimed that none of these burglaries were planned out and were completely random and opportunistic,” Detectove Andjelko Napijalo wrote in a court affidavit.
Police were alerted to an attempted burglary of the Maine Historical Society early Wednesday after someone had shattered a pane in a glass door but failed to get inside the building. Toun and another person were found nearby. Toun was taken into custody on an outstanding warrant and was later charged with attempted burglary. The other person was not charged.
Toun has since been charged with theft or attempted burglary and criminal mischief in connection with break-ins at the following additional locations:
• Bayside American Cafe on Portland Street
• Squeaky Clean Laundromat on Washington Avenue
• LB Kitchen on Congress Street
• Toni’s Touch on Forest Avenue
• Leavitt & Sons Deli on Kennebec Street
• Boda on Congress Street
• Little Tap House on High Street
• Mekong Thai Restaurant on Forest Avenue
Additional burglaries took place recently at Eyes on Rosemont on Middle Street, Maine Oyster Company on Portland Street, Maine Juice Company on Spring Street, Wallace James Clothing on High Street, Lio Restaurant on Spring Street, Others! cafe at Monument Square and Still a Good Cause thrift shop on Forest Avenue.
No charges have been filed in those cases and police have not said whether Toun is a suspect.
Affidavits filed in the case show detectives used security cameras from a number of businesses and buildings around Portland to help piece together the case against Toun. Detectives also recovered a safe from East End Cemetery, discarded clothes from behind a building and a cash register that were linked to Toun by DNA evidence, court records show.
In interviews with police, Toun admitted to breaking into nine businesses, often through unlocked doors and windows, according to the court records.
“Tim made statements during the interview such as ‘I did a bunch of places’ and ‘I was just tired of everything,’” Andjelko wrote in an affidavit.
Court records indicate Toun detailed how he broke into multiple businesses. He told police he entered LB Kitchen through an unlocked front door, found the safe key in the cash register and took the safe to East End Cemetery to open it. It was recovered later the same day by police, court records show.
Toun’s recent criminal history includes guilty pleas in November 2018 to charges of theft, unlawful possession of drugs and violating the conditions of his release.
Another Portland man, Danny Arnold, 42, appeared in court Friday on charges related to a burglary on Thursday.
He was charged with burglary, theft and criminal mischief after he was caught at a construction site at 100 Fore St. early Thursday. Police were called after an alarm alerted an off-site employee that someone was inside a construction trailer at the historic industrial site known as the Portland Company complex.
Arnold previously served nine months of a two-year sentence for burglary in 2010 and has convictions for assault, domestic violence assault, carrying a concealed weapon and violating a protective order, among other charges.
His most recent conviction came in 2017 for aggravated assault and criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, both felonies for which he was sentenced to serve nine months of a three-year sentence. Arnold violated his probation multiple times and was incarcerated for short periods following each violation, including one notable incident in 2018 when he was a suspect in the killing of a pregnant goat at Smiling Hill Farm in Westbrook.
Arnold wasn’t charged with killing the goat, but he was charged with violating probation for possessing a crossbow, the same weapon used to kill the goat.
Though the burglaries have been concentrated around downtown, they didn’t appear to target specific businesses. The burglar or burglars typically went after cash registers and safes inside the businesses, sometimes taking a register or small safe if it could not be opened.

Full text: Portland police say Tim Toun, 30, was taken into custody and is being investigated in connection with more than a dozen recent burglaries at Portland businesses.
Police: Tim Toun investigated in connection with string of Portland break-ins

Portland police arrested a city man following an attempted break-in early Wednesday and say he may be charged with other recent burglaries of businesses in and around the downtown.
Tim Toun, a 30-year-old Valley Street resident, was arrested before dawn by officers responding to an attempted break-in at the Maine Historical Society on Congress Street. The organization has a gift shop adjacent to its museum and library.
Toun is charged with criminal mischief and criminal attempt, along with a warrant for previous theft cases, Lt. Robert Martin said. Police have not yet filed charges in connection with a string of more than a dozen commercial burglaries on the Portland peninsula since July 28, but investigators have developed probable cause and anticipate charging Toun in connection with some of the cases, Martin said.
“We have a person in custody for a warrant and we’re working on charges in connection with the burglaries,” Martin said, in response to questions about Toun.
Police responded to the historical society at 489 Congress St. about 2:46 a.m., after a citizen reported hearing glass breaking. Police found that a glass door’s outer window pane was broken, but the inner pane was intact and no one was able to enter the building, Martin said.
Police found Toun in the area of Preble Street with another person, who was not charged. Toun was being held on $1,500 cash bail, and could make his first court appearance Thursday or Friday.
Police have stepped up patrols as they investigate the burglary of 15 businesses — including the historical society — since July 28. Investigators say the burglaries have been reported in the same geographical area of the city. Some of the break-ins targeted businesses with unlocked doors, while others took place at businesses with locked doors and security systems.
The historical society is adjacent to the Wadsworth-Longfellow House and is in the heart of Portland’s downtown a few blocks from City Hall.
Though the burglaries have been concentrated around Portland’s downtown, the break-ins didn’t appear to target specific businesses. Based on the location and the products being sold, the burglaries seem to have been committed on a random basis. The businesses range from an optometrist’s office, apparel designer and a shop specializing in juice smoothies to a hair salon, Thai restaurant and craft beer gastropub.
“At this time, we’re developing the cases for the burglaries,” Martin said.
Burglaries also have been reported at Eyes on Rosemont on Middle Street; Maine Oyster Company on Portland Street; Maine Juice Company on Spring Street; Wallace James Clothing on High Street; Boda on Congress Street; Little Tap House on High Street; Leavitt & Sons Deli on Kennebec Street; Toni’s Touch on Forest Avenue; LB Kitchen on Congress Street; Lio Restaurant on Spring Street; Squeaky Clean Laundromat on Washington Avenue; Others! cafe at Monument Square; Bayside American Cafe on Portland Street; and Still a Good Cause thrift shop on Forest Avenue.
The burglar or burglars typically went after cash registers and safes inside the businesses, sometimes taking the entire register or small safes if they could not be opened. Portland police had advised business owners to lock up, install security systems and leave cash registers empty and open, and safes secured so that a burglar would leave them alone and not try to carry them off.
Toun’s recent criminal history includes convictions for theft, unlawful possession of drugs, and violating the conditions of his release. He pleaded guilty to all three charges in November 2018, which stemmed from an incident in which police searched a car that belonged to a woman on bail conditions. Toun was also in the car, and because police found a crack pipe and other paraphernalia in the car, officers had probable cause to search Toun, according to a police report filed in Cumberland County Unified Court.
During that search, they found a stolen iPhone Toun had taken moments earlier from a house where police were originally called on Rochester Street, along with a Suboxone sublingual strip, a drug used to prevent the symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
Police returned the iPhone to the woman who owned it, and Toun was arrested. He pleaded guilty at his first appearance in court and was sentenced to three days in jail.

Full text: Two more burglaries were reported Tuesday, prompting police to step up patrols of local businesses.

Portland police are investigating two more break-ins they say are similar to a dozen burglaries that have occurred at local businesses since July 28.
Break-ins were reported Tuesday morning at Bayside American Cafe on Portland Street and at the Still a Good Cause thrift shop on Forest Avenue, Lt. Robert Martin said. That brings to 14 the total number of businesses that have reported burglaries in the past three weeks.
Investigators say the burglaries have been reported in the same geographical area of the city, but some targeted businesses with unlocked doors, while others were at businesses with locked doors and security systems. Police have increased patrols of businesses, but continue to find some businesses with unsecured doors or windows.
There doesn’t seem to be any pattern to the commercial businesses that were burglarized. Based on the location and the products being sold, the burglaries seem to have been committed on a random basis. The businesses range in use from an optometrist’s office, apparel designer and a shop specializing in juice smoothies to a hair salon, Thai restaurant and craft beer gastropub.

Police responded to an alarm call at Bayside American Cafe, formerly Bintliffs, at 3:18 a.m. Tuesday, Martin said. Officers found an open door and open window at the cafe. Martin said it’s possible someone reached through the window to unlock the door. The restaurant’s safe was damaged, but no cash was taken, Martin said.
Martin said police also are investigating a reported burglary at the Still a Good Cause thrift shop on Forest Avenue after a door was found pried open. Employees did not believe entry had been made into the building and no other details were available Tuesday afternoon, he said.
Joe Catoggio, who has owned Bayside American Cafe with his wife, Diane, since 2003, said his alarm company notified him at 3 a.m. that something set off a motion sensor inside the building. A security guard who responded to the alarm found the front door ajar and called police, he said. No one was in the restaurant when police arrived.
“They had come in and rifled around looking for cash,” Catoggio said. “They tried to chisel their way into our antique safe. That hurts the most.”
Catoggio said the safe is from 1847 and now has gouges on it, as does the oil painting that was hanging on the front of the safe.
“It was my favorite piece in here,” he said of the painting.
Catoggio said his restaurant was been broken into before by people looking for liquor, but he hasn’t experienced anything like Tuesday’s burglary.
“These folks seem to be a little more sophisticated. The police called them clever,” he said. “It’s not your typical smash and grab.”
Cara Stadler’s Spring Street restaurant Lio was broken into Aug. 17 and the safe was stolen, she said. She said the burglary was similar to ones at nearby restaurants, including LB Kitchen on Congress Street.
“Like Lee (Farrington) at LB Kitchen said, we’re trying to make ends meet and they’re stealing from us,” she said, adding she is insured and had to pay for new locks at the restaurant.
Burglaries also have been reported at Eyes on Rosemont on Middle Street; Maine Oyster Company on Portland Street; Maine Juice Company on Spring Street; Wallace James Clothing on High Street; Boda on Congress Street; Little Tap House on High Street; Leavitt & Sons Deli on Kennebec Street; Toni’s Touch on Forest Avenue; LB Kitchen on Congress Street; Lio Restaurant on Spring Street; Squeaky Clean Laundromat on Washington Avenue; and Others! Cafe at Monument Square.
Martin said officers are continuing to do proactive patrols to check businesses to make sure they are secure.
but officers continue to find businesses with open windows or unlocked doors. In some cases, business owners or employees have declined to respond when notified of alarm activation, only to later find the business had been broken into.
“Last night, they were out and found several businesses that were not secured. One of them was a business we’ve previously found not secured,” he said.
Martin said businesses should make sure doors and windows are locked and security systems are activated. He also suggested cash registers be left empty and open and that safes are secured to something if they are small enough to be picked up.
“The suspects have been going into businesses that are alarmed and not alarmed,” he said. “They’re taking the whole register when they go in. They’re making quick work by taking a safe if it’s a manageable weight.”
Portland police said they are actively pursuing investigative leads but have not made any arrests. Anyone with information they believe could help police solve the crimes can call 874-8575 or the anonymous tip line at 874-8584.
Martin also encourages business owners to contact police to make sure the department has updated contact information in case a business is found unsecured or a burglary is reported.

Tests mean unusual wait for some harvesters

Full text: Some question whether the state is equipped to effectively test for toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning in clams, mussels and oysters
Some question whether state equipped to effectively test for toxins that can cause shellfish poisoning

Maine shellfish harvesters hope to make up for a longer-than-usual closure of harvest sites caused by the biological toxin known as red tide.
Maine’s Department of Marine Resources routinely posts closures every year that affect clam, mussel and oyster flats up and down the state’s coastline. This year’s closure stretched for three months in parts of southern Maine, nearly three times as long as the normal four to five weeks, and only recently was lifted.
“We don’t have any specific indication of what caused the longer red tide season in southern Maine other than noting a large bloom offshore Down East earlier this summer which correlated with the longer season,” said Jeff Nichols, DMR spokesman.
Although red tide, which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP, is not harmful to shellfish, the toxin can be harmful and even fatal to humans, hence the need for closures. PSP symptoms include numbness and tingling of the face, arms and legs, followed by headache, dizziness, nausea and muscular incoordination. Severe poisoning can cause muscle paralysis and respiratory failure.
A marine scientist who used to run the monitoring program for the state said she’s not convinced that levels of toxin, which is produced by the phytoplankton Alexandrium, are any higher.
Darcie Couture, who left the department in 2012 and now runs her own testing lab in Brunswick, said the state conducts far less testing for red tide than it used to and instead orders closures on a precautionary basis.
“It is easy to protect public health — if everything is closed to harvest, then there is no risk to public health,” Couture said. “However, as far as balancing that goal with responsiveness to industry needs, this year seems to have been an epic management failure.”
Nichols did acknowledge that since 2012, the state has relied more on precautionary closures, which require fewer testing sites. In 2012, DMR sampled 328 stations. So far this year, there have been 158, or less than half. Tests are done weekly from March through October.
The state’s new approach means that shellfish zones are closed at the first sign of toxins rather than when toxins exceed a certain level. It’s complicated, though, because toxin levels can spike from week to week.
“Precautionary closures may be made if there are elevated shellfish toxin scores that have not reached the regulatory limit based on a lot of risk factors: phytoplankton trends, current phytoplankton concentrations, weather forecast, sampling frequency and scores at nearby shellfish stations,” Nichols said.
Couture, though, criticized DMR as “ill-equipped to handle fine-tuning closures based on actual shellfish data, because the sampling program is structured differently now than it was prior to 2012.”
“It still seems very hard to explain away the fact that the DMR had longer closures in place this season than during either of the ‘disaster declaration’ years (2005 and 2008),” she added.
Those who make their living on shellfish understand the need to be cautious but they say the impact on the industry is real.
Nicole Twohig is the development coordinator for Quahog Bay Conservancy in Harpswell, which is a nonprofit focused on protecting the ecosystem but also harvests under the brand name Snow Island Oysters.
“We were shut down for about two months, which means we weren’t able to sell,” she said last week. “So that’s a loss of income for us, but the oysters are still there growing. When the closure is lifted, the oysters are bigger than we normally sell so the market is smaller.”
The ideal size, she said, is between 2.5 inches and 3.5 inches.
Twohig said she doesn’t fault the state. It’s doing the best it can. But she, too, wonders whether there are enough resources to manage a burgeoning industry.
“DMR does a really fantastic job regulating the industry for how understaffed they are,” she said. “But people were definitely starting to be concerned once we got to two months,” Twohig said. “You plan for some closures, but if this was my sole income, I would definitely be panicked.”
Nichols said he doesn’t view it as a resource problem. He said biotoxin monitoring and management is conducted by nine DMR staff members, five contract employees and 30 or so volunteers. He said funding is actually more stable now. Contract positions used to be funded with federal disaster relief dollars, which ran out. Now they are part of the General Fund.
Dan Devereaux of Mere Point Oyster Co. in Brunswick also didn’t fault the state and said the task of monitoring for toxins is “a tall order.” But he said he’s noticed a shift in how the closures have happened. He said in years past, red tide used to be more surgically monitored, which had less of an impact on commerce.
“Closing a big area is the safest thing to do, but how do you balance the impact on harvesters?” he said.
The clamming industry has been affected less because their location makes them less susceptible to the biotoxin. A representative from the Maine Clammers Association did not return messages left by a reporter.
Larger shellfish harvesters, known as leaseholders, can ask permission from the state to conduct their own weekly testing, at their expense. Many do, and if they come back clean, the leaseholders can harvest.
But smaller harvesters, known as limited purpose aquaculture sites, or LPAs, don’t have that option.
There are about 125 leaseholders and nearly 600 LPAs operating in Maine.
“The state takes a conservative approach to this, rightfully so, but it does hinder a lot of small farms, which can’t test their products,” Devereaux said.
Red tide is an annual occurrence in Maine, but there are other toxins that requiring monitoring as well.
Last year, the state was forced to close large sections of the Down East coast because of a toxic algae bloom called pseudo-nitzschia, a single-cell organism that can bloom unexpectedly and make domoic acid, a dangerous biotoxin that may cause amnesic shellfish poisoning.
, or ASP.
That bloom also led to a rare recall of clams and mussels in two consecutive years.
In addition to biotoxin monitoring, the state also regularly tests for bacteria, which also results in periodic closures of shellfish harvesting areas.
The Department of Marine Resources lists all closures on its website in the form of complex legal notices. More information is available at https://www.maine.gov/dmr/shellfish-sanitation-management/closures/psp.html.

Love sweets, hate cilantro? Genes may explain

Author: Goad, Meredith

Publication info: Morning Sentinel ; Waterville, Me. [Waterville, Me]19 Aug 2019: 2.B.

Full text: Genetics can provide a fascinating glimpse into our eating habits.

If you’ve ever wanted to blame the sweet tooth you inherited from your great-great-grandma for that second scoop of ice cream you just ate (and thus your big, child-bearing hips), well, now you can. Kind of. You can, at least, forgive yourself for a moment of weakness.
The science of genetics is opening a window — just a crack — onto our food preferences, including that sweet tooth, and the view is fascinating. I discovered this firsthand recently, when I got updated results from an ancestry.com DNA test I took a few years ago. The test uncovered the genetic roots of my sensitivities to sweet, bitter and savory tastes, and I learned more about my love of cilantro and the reason I hold my breath in the bathroom after eating asparagus.
Other companies also do this kind of testing, but I’ve been a member of ancestry.com for eight years. It’s where I keep my still-growing family tree, begun the old-fashioned way by my father in small-town records and remote, overgrown graveyards, and continued by me using online resources. Genealogy is addictive. As Barry Starr, director of scientific communication at ancestry.com, humorously put it in a recent interview, each new discovery — another relative identified on a 19th-century census record or a cause of death uncovered on a 1930s-era death certificate — gives you a little hit of dopamine. So when the DNA tests finally fell into a price range I could afford, my curiosity won out and I ordered one. I spit into a little tube and sent my genes off to the lab.
Initially the test just tracked my ethnicity. If it proved anything beyond a shadow of a doubt, it’s that I’m one of the whitest people on the planet, despite my longing for a more diverse background. A whopping 57 percent of my genes can be traced back to England, Wales and northwestern Europe. Another 29 percent hails from Ireland and Scotland. I have an 11 percent serving of Germanic Europe and just a dollop of Norway in my chromosomes. Initially my test also showed traces of North African and Persian DNA. But here’s the great thing about the test: As the pool of people submitting their spit to ancestry.com grows, and the organization’s scientists learn more from their DNA, they can narrow down your own family origins and give you updates. The updates are free; they’re just another little dopamine hit when you turn on your computer and discover new information in your account. In my case – much to my disappointment – the traces of North African and Persian DNA fell away.
Then, not long ago, I signed onto my account and discovered a new section on genetic traits, ranging from genes that affect my appearance to those that affect how my body processes vitamins. Most interesting to me were the sensory traits, many of which deal with food preferences. By testing two olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11, for example, the test confirmed that I love cilantro — I’m not one of those people who think the herb tastes like dish soap.
But I am one of those people who have always noticed a certain, um, odor in the bathroom after eating asparagus. When we digest asparagus, our body produces asparagusic acid, which breaks down into funky-smelling compounds in our urine. The ability to smell these compounds is a dominant trait, so I inherited it from one of my parents (gee, thanks, Mom and Dad). People who cannot detect these metabolites are said to have “asparagus anosmia.”

NATURE VS. NURTURE Genetics aren’t the only thing that determine whether you prefer sweet over savory, love or hate cilantro, or can smell your stinky urine, however.
“Basically what we say is genetics loads the gun but environment fires it, pulls the trigger,” says Danielle Reed, a taste geneticist who is also associate director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, a nonprofit dedicated to basic research on taste and smell. “You have a certain landscape of what you can and cannot taste that is determined genetically, then you have a whole life experience that fills in the gaps that drive you toward what you like and don’t like to eat.”
My genetics say, for example, that I am extra-sensitive to the taste of bitter foods, which should mean that every time I take a bite of Brussels sprouts or broccoli, which contain bitter natural compounds called glucosinolates, my face should scrunch up in a look that says “This is revolting.” But I love broccoli, bitter greens and cauliflower. I confess I hated Brussels sprouts when I was a kid, but I think that had more to do with the way my mother prepared them than their natural flavor.
So what’s up? The ancestry.com test examines three markers in the TAS2R38 gene, which plays a key role in how we perceive bitter flavors. But Reed and Starr both point out that other genes may be at play as well. Reed says humans have 25 bitter receptors, each tuned to different bitter compounds. Some people are blind to certain bitter tastes, she said, but not all of them. Others may be able to taste the bitterness of, say, Brussels sprouts, but they like it.
That contradiction could be due to the confounding environmental factor, which can include cultural differences. Starr once tested the perception of bitter on a variety of people using strips coated with a synthetic chemical similar to glucosinolates. “Most people responded in horror at the taste of it,” Starr said. “But a friend of mine who grew up in a part of Asia where there were a lot of bitter foods in the diet actually didn’t mind at all. She thought it was fine.”
Sensitivity to bitter tastes is a dominant trait, which means at least one of my parents must be a “taster.” I’m guessing it’s my father, who won’t let a single bite of broccoli get past his lips but loves collard greens because he was raised in the South, where collards are regularly on the dinner table. Eating a food you hate until you like it, or at least tolerate it, is an example of the “mere exposure effect,” Reed explained, “and it means that you come to like things that you’re constantly exposed to.”
Most Americans would be disgusted by natto, fermented soybeans with a “snot-like” texture that are enjoyed in Japan, says scientist Bob Holmes, author of the 2017 book “Flavor: The Science of Our Most Neglected Sense.” And Japanese consumers have, historically, snubbed cheese, which is beloved by many westerners. “That seems to be cultural,” Holmes said, “because cheese is becoming more popular in Asia, and certainly second-generation Asian-Americans are perfectly happy with cheese.”
Holmes is a lot like me. He had his DNA tested through Monell, then followed up with a panel of taste receptor tests and discovered he’s very sensitive to bitter tastes. That means he should be pushing them away. In fact, he loves bitter greens, especially rapini (or broccoli rabe). He chalks up the discrepancy between his genes and taste buds to life experiences.
“Nobody likes the first taste of coffee” because of the bitterness, Holmes said, “but we quickly learn that it comes with all sorts of pleasurable consequences. You get that buzz from it, and you start to associate coffee with being out with friends, so you learn to love the bitter.”
Holmes also cited experiments by the Oxford psychologist Charles Spence that illustrated just how important environment is in flavor perception.
“He had people eat oysters listening to the sounds of the seashore, like crashing waves and calling seagulls, versus when they were listening to cattle mooing,” Holmes said. “They rated that the oysters tasted better, and tasted more of the sea, when they could hear the sounds of the seashore.”

SWEET DEAL You might think that someone whose genes indicate they are sensitive to sweet tastes would have a huge sweet tooth. But it’s actually the opposite. People who are sensitive to sweets “just want a small piece of cake instead of a big piece of cake,” Starr said. “There’s less required to feel like you’ve had enough sweets.”
According to my test results, I’m “a little more sensitive” to sweets. That makes sense to me because I occasionally crave sweets (especially ice cream and chocolate), but once I indulge, I can sometimes go days or weeks without more. And I’m hyper-sensitive to the sugary syrups used at a lot of coffee houses and bars. A little sugar goes a long way.
Humans are wired for sugar, scientists say, perhaps because our ancient ancestors learned that honey or fruit provided a quick source of energy. (Similarly, humans may have evolved to reject bitter tastes because it helped them avoid poisonous foods.)
“We have wonderful videos of infants in utero when their mothers have glucose in their amniotic fluid because their mother is diabetic,” Reed said. “You can see that the infant is drinking the sweetened solution in the amniotic fluid. So babies can taste it in utero.”
But environment affects how we perceive sweet as well. Holmes’ tests, for example, showed that he is less sensitive to sweet flavors, which means it should take more sweets to satisfy him. But the very morning he found out that bit of information about himself, he had to pour out a sweetened iced cappuccino he bought at Starbucks. “I couldn’t drink it because it was too sweet,” he said. “And I have no problems skipping dessert. So behaviorally I don’t have a sweet tooth, even though my genes and my lab tests suggest that I do.”
Holmes suspects his palate leans this way because his family rarely ate dessert when he was a child.
Reed said the “reward factor” also plays a big role in our desire for sweets. “Food is very rewarding for some people,” she said, “and they just cannot let go of the reward value of sugared foods. That’s probably a combination of both their genetic makeup and their experience. Some people have a lifetime of experience eating sugar to comfort themselves.”
Sensitivity to savory flavors, or umami, works the same way. My test showed I’m “a little less sensitive” to umami, which may explain my love of aged cheeses and ripe tomatoes.
Can anything practical be learned from all of this, or is a genetic exploration of our flavor preferences just a bit of fun? It’s too early to say how such knowledge could help people meet nutritional goals or otherwise improve their health, Reed said. But knowing, for example, that your genes say you can’t taste sweet foods especially well could encourage you to treat yourself with more compassion, she says.
“It will help you understand why you’re putting four teaspoons of sugar in your coffee, right?” Reed said. “It’s no longer a moral weakness. It’s just there’s a biology there.”

Full text: Genetics can provide a fascinating glimpse into our eating habits.

If you’ve ever wanted to blame the sweet tooth you inherited from your great-great-grandma for that second scoop of ice cream you just ate (and thus your big, child-bearing hips), well, now you can. Kind of. You can, at least, forgive yourself for a moment of weakness.
The science of genetics is opening a window — just a crack — onto our food preferences, including that sweet tooth, and the view is fascinating. I discovered this firsthand recently, when I got updated results from an ancestry.com DNA test I took a few years ago. The test uncovered the genetic roots of my sensitivities to sweet, bitter and savory tastes, and I learned more about my love of cilantro and the reason I hold my breath in the bathroom after eating asparagus.
Other companies also do this kind of testing, but I’ve been a member of ancestry.com for eight years. It’s where I keep my still-growing family tree, begun the old-fashioned way by my father in small-town records and remote, overgrown graveyards, and continued by me using online resources. Genealogy is addictive. As Barry Starr, director of scientific communication at ancestry.com, humorously put it in a recent interview, each new discovery — another relative identified on a 19th-century census record or a cause of death uncovered on a 1930s-era death certificate — gives you a little hit of dopamine. So when the DNA tests finally fell into a price range I could afford, my curiosity won out and I ordered one. I spit into a little tube and sent my genes off to the lab.
Initially the test just tracked my ethnicity. If it proved anything beyond a shadow of a doubt, it’s that I’m one of the whitest people on the planet, despite my longing for a more diverse background. A whopping 57 percent of my genes can be traced back to England, Wales and northwestern Europe. Another 29 percent hails from Ireland and Scotland. I have an 11 percent serving of Germanic Europe and just a dollop of Norway in my chromosomes. Initially my test also showed traces of North African and Persian DNA. But here’s the great thing about the test: As the pool of people submitting their spit to ancestry.com grows, and the organization’s scientists learn more from their DNA, they can narrow down your own family origins and give you updates. The updates are free; they’re just another little dopamine hit when you turn on your computer and discover new information in your account. In my case — much to my disappointment — the traces of North African and Persian DNA fell away.
Then, not long ago, I signed onto my account and discovered a new section on genetic traits, ranging from genes that affect my appearance to those that affect how my body processes vitamins. Most interesting to me were the sensory traits, many of which deal with food preferences. By testing two olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11, for example, the test confirmed that I love cilantro — I’m not one of those people who think the herb tastes like dish soap.
But I am one of those people who have always noticed a certain, um, odor in the bathroom after eating asparagus. When we digest asparagus, our body produces asparagusic acid, which breaks down into funky-smelling compounds in our urine.
The ability to smell these compounds is a dominant trait, so I inherited it from one of my parents (gee, thanks, Mom and Dad). People who cannot detect these metabolites are said to have “asparagus anosmia.”

NATURE VS. NURTURE
Genetics aren’t the only thing that determine whether you prefer sweet over savory, love or hate cilantro, or can smell your stinky urine, however.
“Basically what we say is genetics loads the gun but environment fires it, pulls the trigger,” says Danielle Reed, a taste geneticist who is also associate director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, a nonprofit dedicated to basic research on taste and smell. “You have a certain landscape of what you can and cannot taste that is determined genetically, then you have a whole life experience that fills in the gaps that drive you toward what you like and don’t like to eat.”
My genetics say, for example, that I am extra-sensitive to the taste of bitter foods, which should mean that every time I take a bite of Brussels sprouts or broccoli, which contain bitter natural compounds called glucosinolates, my face should scrunch up in a look that says “This is revolting.” But I love broccoli, bitter greens and cauliflower. I confess I hated Brussels sprouts when I was a kid, but I think that had more to do with the way my mother prepared them than their natural flavor.
So what’s up? The ancestry.com test examines three markers in the TAS2R38 gene, which plays a key role in how we perceive bitter flavors. But Reed and Starr both point out that other genes may be at play as well. Reed says humans have 25 bitter receptors, each tuned to different bitter compounds. Some people are blind to certain bitter tastes, she said, but not all of them. Others may be able to taste the bitterness of, say, Brussels sprouts, but they like it.
That contradiction could be due to the confounding environmental factor, which can include cultural differences. Starr once tested the perception of bitter on a variety of people using strips coated with a synthetic chemical similar to glucosinolates. “Most people responded in horror at the taste of it,” Starr said. “But a friend of mine who grew up in a part of Asia where there were a lot of bitter foods in the diet actually didn’t mind at all. She thought it was fine.”
Sensitivity to bitter tastes is a dominant trait, which means at least one of my parents must be a “taster.” I’m guessing it’s my father, who won’t let a single bite of broccoli get past his lips but loves collard greens because he was raised in the South, where collards are regularly on the dinner table. Eating a food you hate until you like it, or at least tolerate it, is an example of the “mere exposure effect,” Reed explained, “and it means that you come to like things that you’re constantly exposed to.”
Most Americans would be disgusted by natto, fermented soybeans with a “snot-like” texture that are enjoyed in Japan, says scientist Bob Holmes, author of the 2017 book “Flavor: The Science of Our Most Neglected Sense.” And Japanese consumers have, historically, snubbed cheese, which is beloved by many westerners. “That seems to be cultural,” Holmes said, “because cheese is becoming more popular in Asia, and certainly second-generation Asian-Americans are perfectly happy with cheese.”
Holmes is a lot like me. He had his DNA tested through Monell, then followed up with a panel of taste receptor tests and discovered he’s very sensitive to bitter tastes. That means he should be pushing them away. In fact, he loves bitter greens, especially rapini (or broccoli rabe). He chalks up the discrepancy between his genes and taste buds to life experiences.
“Nobody likes the first taste of coffee” because of the bitterness, Holmes said, “but we quickly learn that it comes with all sorts of pleasurable consequences. You get that buzz from it, and you start to associate coffee with being out with friends, so you learn to love the bitter.”
Holmes also cited experiments by the Oxford psychologist Charles Spence that illustrated just how important environment is in flavor perception.
“He had people eat oysters listening to the sounds of the seashore, like crashing waves and calling seagulls, versus when they were listening to cattle mooing,” Holmes said. “They rated that the oysters tasted better, and tasted more of the sea, when they could hear the sounds of the seashore.”

SWEET DEAL
You might think that someone whose genes indicate they are sensitive to sweet tastes would have a huge sweet tooth. But it’s actually the opposite. People who are sensitive to sweets “just want a small piece of cake instead of a big piece of cake,” Starr said. “There’s less required to feel like you’ve had enough sweets.”
According to my test results, I’m “a little more sensitive” to sweets. That makes sense to me because I occasionally crave sweets (especially ice cream and chocolate), but once I indulge, I can sometimes go days or weeks without more. And I’m hyper-sensitive to the sugary syrups used at a lot of coffee houses and bars. A little sugar goes a long way.
Humans are wired for sugar, scientists say, perhaps because our ancient ancestors learned that honey or fruit provided a quick source of energy. (Similarly, humans may have evolved to reject bitter tastes because it helped them avoid poisonous foods.)
“We have wonderful videos of infants in utero when their mothers have glucose in their amniotic fluid because their mother is diabetic,” Reed said. “You can see that the infant is drinking the sweetened solution in the amniotic fluid. So babies can taste it in utero.”
But environment affects how we perceive sweet as well. Holmes’ tests, for example, showed that he is less sensitive to sweet flavors, which means it should take more sweets to satisfy him. But the very morning he found out that bit of information about himself, he had to pour out a sweetened iced cappuccino he bought at Starbucks. “I couldn’t drink it because it was too sweet,” he said. “And I have no problems skipping dessert. So behaviorally I don’t have a sweet tooth, even though my genes and my lab tests suggest that I do.”
Holmes suspects his palate leans this way because his family rarely ate dessert when he was a child.
Reed said the “reward factor” also plays a big role in our desire for sweets. “Food is very rewarding for some people,” she said, “and they just cannot let go of the reward value of sugared foods. That’s probably a combination of both their genetic makeup and their experience. Some people have a lifetime of experience eating sugar to comfort themselves.”
Sensitivity to savory flavors, or umami, works the same way. My test showed I’m “a little less sensitive” to umami, which may explain my love of aged cheeses and ripe tomatoes.
Can anything practical be learned from all of this, or is a genetic exploration of our flavor preferences just a bit of fun? It’s too early to say how such knowledge could help people meet nutritional goals or otherwise improve their health, Reed said. But knowing, for example, that your genes say you can’t taste sweet foods especially well could encourage you to treat yourself with more compassion, she says.
“It will help you understand why you’re putting four teaspoons of sugar in your coffee, right?” Reed said. “It’s no longer a moral weakness. It’s just there’s a biology there.”

Company never answers allegations it was part of embezzlement

A federal judge Thursday ordered a company allegedly created to help facilitate a scheme to steal lobsters to pay a civil judgment of more than $4.5 million.
The ruling came in a civil suit filed by Sea Salt, a Saco restaurant and lobster wholesaler, against a former employee and part owner over lobsters allegedly shipped off the books and resold.
The suit, filed last September, said Matthew Bellerose of Scarborough shipped lobsters from Sea Salt without generating shipping labels or invoices so the company didn’t bill and wasn’t paid for the crustaceans. Sea Salt contends Bellerose, who had worked for the business since 2009, shipped nearly $1.5 million worth of lobster that he and a partner then sold.
Bellerose and his partner, Vincent J. Mastropasqua of Portland, set up a company, East End Transport, to handle some of the shipments, Sea Salt’s suit said.
Sea Salt sued Bellerose; Mastropasqua; his brother Anthony Mastropasqua; Amanda Bellerose, Matthew Bellerose’s wife; and East End Transport seeking to recover its losses. Because the suit alleges a criminal conspiracy, Sea Salt was able to seek triple its losses as damages, and U.S. District Judge John A. Woodcock Jr. imposed that penalty after a short hearing Thursday.
Woodcock had earlier entered a default judgment against East End Transport because it didn’t defend itself against the allegations. No one representing the company or the other defendants was at Thursday’s hearing, held to determine damages.
Laura White, Sea Salt’s lawyer, said it isn’t clear whether East End Transport has any assets that can be used to satisfy the judgment.
“That’s what I’m going to find out,” she said after the hearing.
Matthew Bellerose was in charge of Sea Salt’s order fulfillment and shipping operation. In 2017, he was offered a 20% stake in the business.
The suit said Bellerose admitted the embezzlement to his Sea Salt partners and offered to pay back the money after he was fired in June 2018. Bellerose said he did it to pay for his 20% share of the company, the suit says.
“Guys, I just want to say I’m really sorry,” Bellerose texted his partners, according to the suit. “Not only have I betrayed your trust but years of friendship as well and that one will haunt me forever. … I’d like to resolve this as best as I possibly can with you guys without my innocent family having to suffer for my bad decisions.”
Both Matthew and Amanda Bellerose and the Mastropasqua brothers have denied the allegations in court filings. The civil cases against the other defendants are currently scheduled for trial in March.
Another Maine lobster wholesaler lost money in an embezzlement scheme similar to the one Bellerose and the others are accused of. In January 2018, a former Massachusetts man pleaded guilty to shipping 50,000 pounds of lobster, worth about $360,000, to a customer in China.
Jonathan F. Cowles’ employer, Maine Coast Shellfish, was not paid for those lobsters. Cowles also pleaded guilty to federal charges of wire fraud for sending himself $25,000 in commissions to which he wasn’t entitled.
Cowles pleaded guilty and in June 2018 was sentenced to six months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of nearly $360,000. Court records indicated he has since moved to Hawaii, where he will be on supervised release until 2022.

Dana Wilde: A summer flower sermon

Full text: This summer has had an inexplicable phenomenon of early and late summer colliding, writes Dana Wilde.
A typical Maine summer has four times, according to me. Ante: black flies, bluets, mosquitoes and dandelions. Early: hawkweed, buttercups, day lilies and dragonflies. Mid: Queen Anne’s lace, goldenrod, horseflies and deer flies. Late: turning sumac, spiders and northwest wind.
So let me say a few words since July and August, without fail, inspire a sort of cosmic impulse in me to reflect back the beauty carpeting the woods, fields and backyard. Just naming flowers seems to create little dharanis that transact with the wave-topped goldenrod, symmetries of cinquefoils, unearthly trefoils, St. John’s wort, cow vetch, crown vetch, dust-pink steeplebush and Pure-Lands-blue-rayed chicory. The buttonbush and yellow rocket, stitchwort, chickweed, and the bladder campion that took over a huge swath of driveway-side this year. The black-eyed Susans, oxeyes, honeysuckle and fleabane early, stitchwort, chickweed and milkweed. In July, the orange touch-me-nots, the wild madder, meadowsweet and greeny-yellow parsnip. The hemlock, valerian and Queen Anne’s hovering-moon umbels later, and New England, New York and bushy asters at last.
The color green: This summer from the get-go seemed more burgeonously verdant than usual, with maple branches overhanging the driveway that I thought I trimmed back last fall, and soon August will settle into that rich, black-shadow eye-vibration of impending autumn. It will smell like ripening acorns.
There have been this summer, though, unsettling anomalies. Most troubling was the absence of Canada geese on the backroad pond in Jackson, and a fleeting paucity of purple martins in the park. Where did they go this summer? July, it turned out, was the hottest month ever recorded in Maine, according to how many days I stayed in out of the sun and WCSH meteorologist Keith Carson. The catch the last few summers of record-breaking worldwide warmth has been that nighttime lows are bottoming out significantly higher than in the past, raising the average temperature in 24-hour periods. It was certainly true in my bed. There are also the heat wave in Alaska and the alarming amount of melt on Greenland’s glaciers in the past few weeks, which are technically not related to the beauty of Maine’s midsummer woods, but probably, in reality, are.
And there is this summer’s technically inexplicable phenomenon, for example, of early summer colliding with late summer. The lilacs and wild roses were two or three weeks late to blossom this year. The gaudy orange day lilies that grow like sunfire down the embankment behind the mailbox came late, too. Why? Usually they show glimpses of the coming conflagration by mid-June. This year they let July 1 go before they came out, and some of them are still burning, when, if I remember right, they should be going by or gone.
This is the disturbing part, because along with the late-lasting day lilies is early-turning staghorn sumac. Up and down Route 9, whole stands of them look as orange-red as September. They always go sooner than the rest, but how soon is soon? Meaning, as Bonnie observed last week, that early summer has somehow coalesced with late. Like a months-long sentence that somehow got garbled.
I don’t know. I suppose a reader will set me straight and say this has all happened before. But not on my watch. Which admittedly is always addled this time of year by the incredible inflorescent spell we weather here. Blackberry stars, chokecherry fingers early on. Then tansy, yellow goatsbeard, evening primrose, pineapple weed, purple loosestrife, purple nightshade, blue vervain like mandarava flowers hidden in the grass. White sweet, red and rabbit’s foot clovers, Joe-Pye weed, fireweed and medallions of yarrow. Soon will come the heal-all, eyebright, egg-yellow figwort, pearly everlasting’s little chewable oyster shell globes. And ever and anon the goldenrod like prayers bubbling out of the empyrean, one flower to rule them all.
Who knows what is happening. But I can’t stop pointing to the beauty. Put that in your carpet.

Oyster shell recycling aimed at reducing Casco Bay acidification

Full text: The effort is being prompted by a report linking ocean acidification to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.

Tucked behind some of Portland’s most-beloved restaurants, bright-blue bins filled with oyster shells are swarming with flies. Collecting these shells is not a glamorous job. If one lid is slightly ajar, the sharp smell of drying shells hangs in the humid, summer air.
Despite the odor and flies, twice a week Zach Gordon and Libby Davis load about 20 of these 100-pound bins onto a 10-foot trailer attached to the back of Davis’s truck and haul them away.
“I’m doing it for Mother Nature,” Davis chuckled.
Since June, the team has gone out on Tuesdays and Fridays to collect discarded shells from 10 restaurants as part of Ocean to Plate to Ocean, a project by the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership and Maine Coastal Program’s pilot project to reduce ocean acidification by reintegrating the recycled shells into Casco Bay.
The effort was prompted by a report from the Commission to Study the Effects of Coastal and Ocean Acidification on Commercially Harvested and Grown Species, established by the Maine Legislature in 2014. It recommended spreading shells or other forms of calcium carbonate to remediate the impacts of local acidification, a result of climate change.
In its final report published in 2015, the commission highlighted the connection between ocean acidification and rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The report noted that ocean acidification has increased 30 percent since fossil fuels were first used.
Maine’s effort to recycle oyster shells is not novel; nearly 20 other states have shell recycling programs. However, most states do not recycle shells to reduce ocean acidification, instead they use the shells to restore natural oyster reefs.
The report cites research by Mark Green, professor of natural sciences at St. Joesph’s College, finding that acidification hinders calcification, the process by which lobsters, crabs, mussels, oysters and clams form shells. The goal of shell recycling is to add natural calcium sources to the water to reduce acidity and promote calcification.
The Casco Bay Estuary Partnership received $99,180 in funding for the project through the Climate Ready Estuaries — an EPA program that is linked to the National Estuaries Program. Project partners include the Maine Coastal Program, which is running the shell collection effort; Gateways to Opportunity, which is conducting outreach for youth engagement programs; and Bigelow Labs, which is researching the use of shells to ameliorate the impacts of acidification on shellfish aquaculture.
Gordon, a graduate student participating in University of New England North’s ocean food science program, and Davis, the general manager at Maine Oyster Co., are the program’s two collectors.
Gordon and Theresa Torrent, Coastal Educator and Communications Coordinator at the Maine Coastal Program, reached out to approximately 15 restaurants in Portland. Ten agreed to participate in the pilot program.
Davis, who joined the project after hearing about it through the owner of Maine Oyster Co., has a bachelor’s degree in biology and a truck that tows the 10-foot trailer loaded with shells.
On collection day, Gordon, 26, and Davis, 27, hitch the trailer at 8:30 a.m. From there, the team goes from restaurant to restaurant collecting anywhere from a single, 6-gallon bucket filled with oyster shells to seven 30-gallon bins. In place of the full containers, the two leave clean ones and then drive to ecomaine in South Portland for the most taxing aspect of the job — dumping the shells.
The team learned that each bin must be dumped by two people after Gordon hurt his back dumping one himself. The shells are dumped into two 30-cubic yard rolloff containers that are covered to prevent seagulls from getting into the shells. The containers will sit at ecomaine for a year after the last shells are added so the shells can “cure” to ensure all bacteria is dead.
The year-long curing process complies with Department of Environmental Protection rules. It also alleviates concerns about introducing non-native bacteria, as many of the oysters consumed in Maine come from outside the state. The cured shells will then be ready to be dumped in the bay. The team is still developing a method for the restoration.
As with any pilot program, the team has had to troubleshoot obstacles, such as Gordon’s back injury and driving a 10-foot trailer through the Old Port. They have also gotten help through community partners. The restaurants’ efforts to thoroughly sort shells and ecomaine’s help creating a truck ramp has made the job more efficient.
When Eventide, one of the participating restaurants, was initially asked to join the program, the management hesitated because of the volume of oysters served. After hearing that the restaurant would only be responsible for training staff to sort shells from other compost such as lemons, Eventide decided to participate.
Kira Butera, director of operations at Eventide Oyster Co., Honey Paw and Hugo’s, says Eventide shucks between 14,000 and 16,800 oysters a week. Before the recycling project the restaurant composted shells, and Butera said potential environmental payoff from recycling is worth the task of thoroughly sorting shells.
Kit Pashal, general manager at The Shop, a restaurant on Washington Avenue, says that business serves between 12,000 and 15,000 oysters a week during the summer. He says the program is a “win-win” because the free shell pick-ups cut the composting bill by two-thirds.
Torrent, at Maine Coastal Program, expects one of the two containers will be filled next week and the shells will be cured by August 2020. While planning the program, Torrent thought the first container wouldn’t be filled until the fall, and she is impressed with the volume of shells.
“We had no idea we were going to get this much this quickly,” she said.
The team will continue to collect shells until the second container is filled. That will take more time because the tourist season will begin to wind down after the summer.
If the program expands, funding and volunteers will be needed. The team is considering private donations or selling oyster shell merchandise, but do not have any firm plans in place yet.
Regardless of the program’s future, all the community partners say they are excited to participate in a sustainable project.
“We felt this was a great opportunity to give back from the resources we pull from,” said Butera, the Eventide operations manager.

Full text: Sediment removal is needed for the safe passage of Bath-built ships.

BATH — The Department of the Navy in Bath is seeking a 10-year permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to dredge portions of the Kennebec River from Bath to Phippsburg to allow the passage of Bath-built destroyers.
The Navy expects maintenance dredging will be needed every three years, according to a news release.
The first dredging would happen during the winter of 2019-2020 and would move 80,000 cubic yards — roughly the volume of 20 Olympic swimming pools — of sand and sediment from the bottom of the Kennebec River between Bath and Phippsburg, particularly in shoal-prone areas. Shoals are large wave-like formations of sand that accumulate on the bottom of the river.
Up to 50,000 cubic yards will be removed from Doubling Point and dumped in the river near Bluff Head to make the area around Doubling Point 31 feet deep. At the river mouth, up to 20,000 cubic yards will be taken until the river is 29 feet deep and disposed of near Jackknife Ledge. Both disposal sites have been used repeatedly in previous dredging projects.
The dredging process takes approximately a month to complete, using a hopper dredge and/or a mechanical dredge. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not disclose how much the process costs.
These maintenance dredges ensure the Kennebec is deep enough so the military vessels made by Bath Iron Works can move downriver to open ocean. BIW’s most recently christened Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the future USS Daniel Inouye, will leave the Bath shipyard in 2020 for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
Tim Dugan, a spokesperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said that portion of the Kennebec River federal navigation channel is “authorized by Congress to be so wide and so clear. … (BIW) needs to release those ships in a timely fashion. They need those areas of the river free and clear of debris.”
Eleven Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and one Zumwalt-class are under contract for delivery in the next 10 years.
A BIW-built Arleigh Burke class-destroyer has a draft (depth of the hull that sits underwater) of about 30 feet, and a Zumwalt has a draft of 27.6 feet.
BIW spokesman David Hench referred questions about the dredging to the Navy but stated in an email: “Maintaining a navigable channel in the Kennebec River is necessary for safe passage of ships and is essential to our business and our Navy customer’s goal of delivering the quality ships it needs for the nation’s fleet.”
The last dredging of the Kennebec River in April 2017 drew criticism from environmentalists. Federally protected Atlantic salmon, short-nosed sturgeon and Atlantic sturgeon live and spawn in the river, and the dumping of the dredged materials could harm seeding shellfish in Phippsburg, critics argued.
The 2017 dredging was an “emergency” dredging as it was needed to allow the USS Rafael Peralta, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, to depart from Bath, according to previous reports. Shortly before the ship’s departure, it was discovered the ship couldn’t navigate the river, even at high tide, thus an emergency dredging was needed to clear the way.
The Department of the Navy acknowledged the impact dredging the Kennebec River and depositing the material poses on the river’s ecosystem. In a news release, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the Navy is consulting with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
“Both the Navy and Army Corps of Engineers are very concerned about the environmental impacts of the dredging,” said Colleen O’Rourke, a spokesperson for the Department of the Navy in Bath. “As required in the permitting process, we extensively coordinate with both federal and state environmental agencies to ensure that all requirements are met.”
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers outlined turbidity, or the amount of sediment suspended in the water, as one potential problem for species living in the river because it decreases both visibility in the water and the amount of light able to pass through the water.
Dugan said dredging in the winter reduces the impact on the river’s ecosystem because endangered species aren’t spawning then.
“The impacts will be minimal and of short duration,” he said.
David Grey, chairman of the Phippsburg Shellfish Commission, said, “We’re totally fine with them dredging; we support BIW, as long as they don’t do it in the summer when the shellfish are seeding.”
Grey said when the river is dredged during the spring and summer, “the shellfish are more or less suffocated” when the dredged material is deposited in shellfish harvest areas in Phippsburg.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a public request for comment, as required by the Clean Water Act of 1977. They encourage comments from members of the public. Comments should be submitted in writing to Nick Livesay, Director, Bureau of Land Resources, Department of Environmental Protection, 17 State House Station, Augusta, ME, 04333-0017 or tomick.livesay@maine.gov.

Marine Resources rejects petition to change process for aquaculture

Full text: Still no known timeline for decision on Brunswick 40-acre lease
BRUNSWICK — The Department of Marine Resources has rejected a petition to change the criteria for aquaculture lease applications on the basis that the request was “not realistic,” was “arbitrary” and could have a “perverse outcome” for some applicants.
Meanwhile, the company pitching a 40-acre oyster aquaculture lease on Maquoit Bay continues to await the department’s decision on its application, which is now two months overdue.
A group known as Save Maquoit Bay, composed of coastal property owners, lobstermen and fishermen, submitted a 189-signature petition asking officials to include a stipulation requiring the department to consider whether any other locations near a proposed lease site could “accommodate the proposed activities while interfering less with existing and surrounding uses of an area.”
While the petition requested that the actions be imposed statewide, locally, Mere Point Oyster Co.’s proposed 10-year, 40-acre lease has been mired in controversy. A marathon three-day hearing that spanned several months wrapped up in mid-January after waterfront property owners and lobster fishermen spoke out against what they saw as conflicting uses of the bay and the potential infringement on valuable lobstering grounds. Some lobstermen who spoke out against the lease are also members of Save Maquoit Bay.
The department had 120 days to make a ruling, which would have ended May 15; but according to Jeff Nichols, communications director of the Department of Marine Resources, “depending on the complexity of the application and the evidence, it may take longer.”
Now, 60 days past that deadline, all parties still are awaiting a response.
Save Maquoit Bay’s petition further delayed the decision, after a hearing May 22 and a public comment period that extended to June 1.
The group asked for an immediate moratorium on all pending lease applications greater than 10 acres and requested the proposed rule be applied retroactively so it still would apply to the application in Maquoit Bay.
In their decision, department officials said that aside from questions of legality over the proposed changes, “it is not realistic to expect the department to evaluate all other potential lease sites in an undefined ‘vicinity.’” The resources required to conduct diving and scoping sessions for every alternative and to assess every location against the criteria would be immense, the report stated, and alternative lease sites could affect people who previously thought they would not be affected, creating more notice and scoping issues.
“Further, such an exercise could result in the perverse outcome of the selection of a site that does not unreasonably interfere with any existing uses but is unsuitable for the proposed aquaculture activity,” officials said.
The request to impose a moratorium on lease applications greater than 10 acres also was denied because “a 10-acre limitation on lease size may have the unintended effect of causing applicants to apply for multiple leases, as opposed to one single lease of a size that is suitable to meet their needs,” they continued, calling the moratorium “arbitrary.”
Save Maquoit Bay members see it as anything but that, and said in a news release that with the decision, the Maine Department of Marine Resources effectively “turned its back on a growing issue in Maine’s water.”
“The in-water aquaculture leases are huge in Maine,” said Tom Santaguida, a lobsterman. “One person can have 10 100-acre leases or, in other words, own 1,000 acres of the bottom. That is going to impact all of us who are trying to make a living,” he said.
Crystal Canney, spokeswoman for Save Maquoit Bay, is concerned that large leases such as Mere Point’s could harm Maine’s working waterfront beyond just infringing on lobstering grounds.
“With Maine’s large lease size, leases become attractive to out-of-state investors, hoping to own a piece of Maine,” she said in the release. “Aquaculture (with 42 pending leases and a 97% approval rate by the DMR) is no longer about small business in Maine. Our coalition aims to protect Maine’s Ocean from being owned by a handful of individuals at the expense of many.”
She said when the Legislature comes back in January, Save Maquoit Bay will try to have lawmakers address the transferability of leases so that the land cannot be handed over to out-of-state or international corporations without at least a public hearing.
Save Maquoit Bay, which has hundreds of supporters on its Facebook page, will “continue its fight to protect lobstermen and the privatization of Maine’s Oceans,” Canney said.
Dan Devereaux, co-owner of Mere Point Oyster Co. said he and business partner, Doug Niven, are glad the lease criteria were not changed. If adopted, the rules would have implications that reverberated up and down the coast, he said, implications he thinks would damage the burgeoning aquaculture industry and what remains of Maine’s working waterfront.
Canney said the citizen’s petition was a larger-reaching effort to help lobstermen from Lubec to Kittery who are up against a lot, facing regulations and problems involving right whales, bait and now inshore aquaculture. She declined to comment on the department’s delay in the Mere Point Oyster decision.
In the meantime, while Niven and Devereaux await a decision on their lease, operations are being affected by the two-month delay.
“We hoped to have moved the oysters over to the new lease site at this point,” Devereaux said. “We can’t stop them from growing” and they need more space, the bigger they get. They applied for more Limited Purpose Aquaculture sites, or LPAs, in the meantime to accommodate the bigger bivalves. The proposed lease site would allow the company’s annual oyster harvest to increase from about 60,000 in 2018 to about 1.5 million in the next three years, putting as many as 5 million oysters in the water at a given time.
The department has been quiet on when a decision might be forthcoming, but Devereaux said he is patient, knowing that the aquaculture division has been somewhat overwhelmed by the rapid growth in the industry, with more and more Mainers putting in applications for sites as the state moves more toward more “sustainable aquaculture.”
“We’re bursting at the seams,” he said, adding that he hopes the decision comes soon so they can move forward with more space.
No matter what though, “us closing up shop and going away like some are determined to see, … that’s not going to happen,” Devereaux said.
If the application is ultimately denied, they will apply again, he said.
“We like what we do and we believe in it, so we’re going to try to stick around.”

Full text: Here are some cheap, moderate and expensive ways to indulge in Maine's iconic seafood.
For many, it’s not a Maine summer without lobster; for some vacationers, the state crustacean is a must-have at every meal. If you’re still not quite buying the beast-like things as a culinary delicacy — back in the 1800s, lobster was considered fit only to feed state prisoners or use as fertilizer — know that once you’ve cracked into one and developed a taste for it, it can be hard to go back to wanting anything else when within state lines.
Sure, it’s much more expensive than it was before it was considered a luxury shellfish, but it doesn’t have to be eaten in huge amounts or set you back the cost of a mortgage payment to be a memorable gastronomic experience. Here are three local lobster menu specialties that are just that for every budget.
CHEAP: BITE INTO MAINE
What’s cheaper than a lobster roll, but equally addictive? A $13.95 lobster grilled cheese. At two of its three locations, Bite Into Maine has taken up the cause of slinging this delicious invention with aplomb. Witness the melding of fresh Maine lobster with gooey, creamy fontina and sharp white cheddar cheeses, grilled between two chipotle aioli- and butter-slathered slices of sourdough bread. (There’s also a B.L.T. version—lobster with mayo, local tomato, local thick-cut bacon and iceberg lettuce on butter-grilled ciabatta.) You’ll find it at the eatery’s Airstream, stationed at Allagash Brewing from April to December, and at The Commissary, its brick-and-mortar, 12-seat takeout joint in Scarborough.
WHAT: Bite Into Maine
WHERE: Allagash Brewing Co., 50 Industrial Way, Portland; The Commissary, 185 Route 1, Scarborough
HOURS: At Allagash, 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Thursday, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday. In Scarborough, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Sunday.
INFO: 207-289-6142, biteintomaine.com, @biteintomaine on Facebook and Instagram
MID-PRICED: PORTLAND LOBSTER CO.
Slide into a seat on the sunny deck overlooking the working waterfront and crack into a traditional lobster dinner served on a simple paper tray. Market-priced (i.e., determined by weather, the success of the day’s catch, and supply and demand) but moderately so, Portland Lobster Co.’s lobsters — from chicken-sized on up to 2-pounders — are delivered live twice a day. They’re plated up with fries or baked potato, corn on the cob, homemade slaw, and drawn butter. Savor it all while kicking back in the fresh, salty breeze, beneath the cries of gulls overhead, the coos of fellow happy diners all around you and maybe even a live band.
WHAT: Portland Lobster Co.
WHERE: 180 Commercial St., Portland
HOURS: 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday
INFO: 207-775-2112, portlandlobstercompany.com, @PortlandLobsterCompany on Facebook
INDULGENT: FIVE FIFTY-FIVE
Chef Steve Corry’s deft hand with ingredients, both humble and haute, has justifiably made this boîte one of the most lauded in town. And Corry, an alum of Napa’s French Laundry and Domaine Chandon, doesn’t hold back on making Maine ingredients sing. Exhibit A: His truffled Lobster Mac and Cheese — butter-poached lobster folded into black truffles, a blend of artisanal cheeses, white truffle oil and macaroni. It’s so rich and delectable, it’s more like a savory dessert than entree. At $36.50, it’s a splurge worthy of any special occasion.
WHAT: Five Fifty-Five
WHERE: 555 Congress St., Portland
HOURS: Daily, 4:30-9:30 p.m.

time to visit the peninsula
It’s a tale as old as time, and it’s full of pirates and parades, fish stories and fireworks.
When the windjammers blow into Boothbay Harbor for the annual Windjammer Days festival at the end of June, the downtown streets will be buzzing. From June 23-29, life on the peninsula gets ratcheted up a notch as crowds press in for a glimpse of the historic fleet.
It’s an unusual time of year when pirates openly roam the streets threatening to steal the ice cream cones out of children’s hands and something as innocent as rock skipping and tug of war becomes elevated to a competitive sport worthy of trash talk.
The 57th annual Windjammer Days schedule is packed with activities, most of them free and family friendly.
There is a pirate invasion by the Pirates of the Dark Rose, along with pirate ship tours, pirate recruiting, weapons demonstrations, cannon lessons, pirate shoot-out and puppet shows. Other highly anticipated events include an antique boat parade, cod fish relay race, blessing of the fleet, oyster shucking contest and tug of war across the harbor. Visitors enjoy an artist’s alley, lobster eating contest, clambake, rum tasting and Coast Guard Station tours.
The highlight of the festival occurs when the windjammers arrive. The gathering of the fleet takes place between 1 and 3 p.m. Wednesday, June 26. The footbridge is a good place to wait. Fun and games continue until the parade hits the streets around 4 p.m., followed by live music, food, historical tours and fireworks. The windjammers depart Boothbay Harbor the next morning, but the party continues for several days with a golf tournament, concerts, road race and more. The popular lighted boat parade marks the official end of the week’s festivities.
There is a shuttle to control traffic downtown. For a full schedule, visit boothbayharborwindjammerdays.org.
Even after Windjammer Days is over, there is still plenty to do on the peninsula. A visit to Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens in Boothbay will make winter a distant memory and get the home gardener dreaming of what could be.
This 250-acre property is just a mile off Route 27 but transports its guests to a whimsical land with swings, a treehouse, bear den, fairy forest and labyrinth. Trails lead down to scenic water views and there are squirting fountains, spinning sculptures and bold little squirrels who inhabit the land.
Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens has grown over the years, so if it has been a while since your last visit, it may be time to return. There is a lovely gift shop and cafe, lively children’s garden, calming sensory garden, comfortable seating areas to take a break and labeled landscapes for the ambitious gardener who might wish to replicate a few of the plants at home.
Children enjoy scheduled puppet shows, storytimes, crafts, live chickens, pumping water with a hand pump and hanging clothes. They can play in a fairytale playhouse fully equipped with toy kitchen supplies, row a boat, fish for lobster and look for real frogs, turtles, dragonflies and butterflies. Voted “best garden” on TripAdvisor’s website, visit mainegardens.org for more.
Boothbay Railway Village on Route 27 delights young and old with a museum collection of more than 60 antique cars, trains and memorabilia. Staff and volunteers offer locomotive rides, there are historic buildings to tour in the recreated village on campus and children’s activities and special events abound.
On the annual slate of activities for the summer is an Antique Engine Meet, Books in Boothbay summer book fair, Antique Auto Days on the village green, “Rails, Tails & Ales: Midcoast Craft Beer Festival” and more. Visit railwayvillage.org.
Just because school is out in the summertime doesn’t mean learning needs to stop. There’s something to be learned for young and old at the Maine State Aquarium in West Boothbay Harbor. Located at McKown Point, the state operates this small local aquarium that allows visitors to interact with marine life in a large touch tank and even to pet small sharks, under supervision, of course.
It has a stunning waterfront picnic area outside the door, so pack a lunch and stay awhile. There are interactive exhibits, hands-on crafts, tanks filled with local sea creatures ranging from fish and eels to crabs, unusual lobsters and skate. There is also a small gift shop area for souvenirs.
Learn how fishermen use lobster traps, buoys, bait and their boats to catch lobster. For more information, visit maine.gov.
As in past years, the Opera House at Boothbay Harbor will offer a full schedule of live music, art and entertainment this summer. On June 19, the Opera House will display the photography of Associated Press journalist Peter Southwick, a part-time resident of Boothbay. The Celtic band Gaelic Storm blows into town June 25, followed by Paul Sullivan, Tim Sample, folk, bluegrass, ragtime, blues and more. For details and ticket information, visit boothbayoperahouse.com.
Those interested in dinner and a show will enjoy live matinees and dinner theater at Carousel Music Theater. This year there are three summer shows on tap. Guests receive a meal with dessert, served by the cast, along with a live show. Tickets for dessert and a show also are available.
This year’s schedule includes the musicals “A Broadway Salute to our Armed Forces,” “The 39 Steps,” and “Where Have All the Hippies Gone?” For dates and ticket information, visit carouselmusictheater.org.
History buffs will want to take a short ride up Route 27 to see Fort Edgecomb on Davis Island in Edgecomb. The state park features a well-preserved octagonal blockhouse that is open to the public. Finished in 1809, it offers views of the Sheepscot River.
Guided tours and special activities are scheduled in the summer. Guests can get a view of the river from the musket ports and tour the grounds, which have picnic tables and restrooms. A fee is charged.
For a complete calendar of events and dining information for the Boothbay Region, visit the Chamber of Commerce website at boothbayharbor.com.

U.S. House unanimously passes bill to address ocean acidification

Full text: Maine Democrat Chellie Pingree's measure moves to the U.S. Senate, while state lawmakers appear likely to pass Gov. Janet Mills' climate package.

After years of inaction, the U.S. House passed a bill Wednesday directing federal authorities to assess the risks that ocean acidification — a byproduct of global warming — presents to coastal communities, fishermen and the aquaculture industry.
Scientists have shown the oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb greater quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In the Gulf of Maine, researchers have documented that acidic conditions stunt clam growth and make it so difficult for baby oysters to build their first shells that they often die before they can complete them. The effects on lobster, Maine’s most valuable fishery, remain unclear.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democrat representing Maine’s 1st District, first introduced the Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act nearly four years ago, but it failed to receive so much as a hearing, despite having bipartisan support. It passed Wednesday morning by a unanimous voice vote, with six Republican co-sponsors and no concerted opposition in the House, where Democrats have been in the majority since late last year.
“I’m so proud to see the House’s unequivocal, unanimous support for my ocean acidification bill today,” Pingree said in a statement immediately after the vote. “It goes to show that it’s not controversial to study the changes happening to our oceans — in order to take action, we have to understand what we’re dealing with.”
U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat representing Maine’s 2nd District, was a co-sponsor of the bill, as was his Republican predecessor, Bruce Poliquin.
The bill directs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work with state and local experts to assess the likely effects of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge. NOAA would prepare a public report on which communities are most exposed to the problem, and support state efforts to assess their own vulnerabilities.
In early March, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, reintroduced a companion bill in the U.S. Senate, which is co-sponsored by six senators, including both of Maine’s: Republican Susan Collins and independent Angus King, who caucuses with the Democrats. Its prospects are unclear, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has been focused on confirming as many federal judges as possible at the expense of moving legislation. This prompted Louisiana Republican John Kennedy to complain May 22: “We have done nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada.”
Murkowski’s spokeswoman, Karina Borger, said Murkowski would look for opportunities to advance the bill. “It’s definitely a priority of hers, and she will advocate for it and push for it,” Borger said.
Meanwhile, the Maine Legislature is expected to vote next week on Gov. Janet Mills’ climate change bill, L.D. 1679, which would establish a state Climate Change Council to oversee Maine’s efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for climate-change-driven disruptions, including ocean acidification and other changes within the Gulf of Maine.
“Compared with what has been going on nationally, we have been very encouraged to see fairly broad bipartisan support for creating a climate plan and figuring out how to make it happen,” said Hannah Pingree, who has overseen the drafting of the bill as head of the governor’s Office of Policy and Management.
The Maine bill is likely to pass, as Democrats control both houses of the Legislature, it received unanimous, bipartisan committee approval and is one of the governor’s priorities.
Carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere are more than 70 percent higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution, and they now stand at the highest level in at least 800,000 years. The levels would be worse but for the fact that the oceans absorb some of that additional carbon dioxide, but that has caused them to become 30 percent more acidic over the past century and a half, creating conditions that interfere with the chemical processes by which clams, oysters and other organisms grow their shells.

The wonder of radio

Full text: The radio broadcast of the Indianapolis 500 on Memorial Day was a listening ritual for my father, but it had as much to do with radio broadcasting as it did with auto racing.
Having covered the race as a newspaper reporter, Dad loved to give the visual details corresponding to the sounds from the radio as cars screamed past pit row, down the straightaways and around the two long, banked left turns. The whole treble aura of the race was intensified by the AM tonality of the Indianapolis Radio Network — tens of stations, Dad explained, allied once a year to broadcast the “greatest spectacle in motor racing.”
I am always reconnected to Dad’s lore of radio’s former imaginative power. For him, radio had been journalism, oral history, storytelling and distinctive voices and personalities. He came into radio consciousness hearing Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Abbott and Costello, the Green Hornet, “Jack Armstrong: All-American Boy” and the reportage of Edward R. Murrow. Listening to radio in his bed at night, he heard broadcasters calling out to Amelia Earhart, her plane overdue, presumed lost in the Pacific Ocean. And it was his tuning in to the allure of those voices that eventually coalesced into a career in broadcast journalism.
My own son attained radio consciousness listening to both ends of the FM band: National Public Radio and the local rock ’n’ roll stations. I was amused when, at one point, Spencer began tuning in to an oldies radio station, and called the station to request the same songs we play constantly at home. For some reason, hearing it on a CD is not as exciting as hearing it over the airwaves, by request.
The fact that he requested some of the first songs I heard on my first radio intrigued me. I can’t imagine why they call them “oldies.” “Classic rock” sounds much more appealing, since the music carries vivid memories of not only old tunes, but also of my first radio, my first radio station, even my first favorite disc jockey. This was an important threshold in my development: A new world was out there awaiting frequency-modulation reception.
I tuned in on an old Zenith, large by today’s standards: wooden, with gold cloth covering the speaker; a distant ancestor of my present sleek, black, digital tuner. It had two knobs: volume and tuning. Its tubes made it a primitive, technological bivalve. I promptly covered it with aqua paisley contact paper — shiny and psychedelic to match the music I had found at 104.1 FM in Boston.
WBCN was a “concert music” station that had just changed format to “album-oriented” rock ’n’ roll. Stephen the Seagull was my DJ, and I called him to request “Crown of Creation,” by Jefferson Airplane, the band that evolved into Jefferson Starship, and finally just Starship. Of course, the original members of this band have children who are themselves of childbearing age; Starship, the next generation, must be tuning in all over again, on sleek stereo components, and wondering about their grandparents’ early gigs in the days of amps with tubes. This, too, is radio lore.
Though Spencer’s first radio had the latest technology and was not a hand-me-down like mine, an interesting thing happened when his grandfather gave him an old-fashioned crystal radio set as a gift: It thrilled him.
This even-more-primitive technology edged closer to the magic of radio: He had in his hands the secret of music seemingly out of nothing. He had wound the very coils that plucked radio signals from the air. Here was the elemental lore of radio: voices coming from nowhere, through copper wire coiled around a cardboard tube, connected to an ear plug by a small crystal diode. The crystal radio was the intersection of science, how things work, and communication, listening and talking to others. Here was the spectacular essence of radio: foreign, remote sound appearing out of thin air … like the magic of an Indy car roaring into a kid’s ears and imagination on Memorial Day in Maine.

HARPSWELL — A short line of black floating tubes comes into view during a boat trip around Hopkins Island [Derived headline]

Full text: HARPSWELL — A short line of black floating tubes comes into view during a boat trip around Hopkins Island in Cundy’s Harbor. While they’re large enough for passing boaters and fishermen to spot, they don’t rise out of the water much higher than a lobster buoy.
This is one of Peter Rand’s aquaculture leases. He’s among the hundreds in Maine getting involved in the burgeoning aquaculture industry, which has pumped millions into the Maine economy but is now under fire from lobstermen who compete for the same fishing grounds and homeowners who don’t want to see aquaculture sites from their waterfront properties.
The situation is coming to a head as the Department of Marine Resources holds a hearing Wednesday on whether to amend its rules to limit the size and location of aquaculture lease sites.
In March, the Department of Marine Resources received a petition with 189 signatures seeking an immediate moratorium on aquaculture leases larger than 10 acres. The petition also sought to create a new rule requiring that regulators consider alternate locations before approving aquaculture leases.
The petition triggered a rule-making process that begins with Wednesday’s hearing.
In 2017, Maine aquaculture brought in 2.8 million pounds of oysters and had an estimated $13.6 million economic impact.
That number is dwarfed by the landings value of Maine’s most famous shellfish — lobsters. Maine lobster landings were valued at a whopping $484 million in 2018.
Still, the exponential growth of Maine oysters makes it a force to be reckoned with, and its value already has eclipsed other popular fisheries along Maine’s coast, including groundfish, blue mussels and scallops.
But as the popularity and sustainability of aquaculture continue to rise along the coastline, so does controversy. Tempers have flared around a proposed 40-acre oyster farm in Maquoit Bay, with a coalition of waterfront property owners and lobster fishermen putting big money behind efforts to stymie the development. Other proposals, such as expanding an aquaculture farm in Kittery to 3.67 acres, also have faced resistance.
That opposition came to a head in March. A group known as Save Maquoit Bay submitted 189-signature petition to the Department of Marine Resources, asking it to include a new decision criteria requiring the department to consider whether any other locations near a proposed lease site could “accommodate the proposed activities while interfering less with existing and surrounding uses of an area,” according to the department.
“We support aquaculture when it is good for all parties,” said Paul Dioli, a member of Save Maquoit Bay, in a news release. “With more and more aquaculture leases flooding in, the challenge is to build an aquaculture industry that coexists and does not compete with lobstering. Lobstermen we have talked to around the state are concerned their industry is being overlooked and hurt economically.”
“We need to seriously consider how we site these leases so aquaculture can grow, but not at the expense of the $500 million dollar lobster industry,” lobsterman John Powers said after the department agreed to host the hearing.
According to the request, the changes would allow the department to “review all aquaculture projects with a critical eye to what it means to all who use and make their living on the water.” They urged the department to “revise the outdated lease criteria and take a more holistic approach to the future of Maine’s Coastline.”
The group also asked for an immediate moratorium on all pending lease applications greater than 10 acres — the maximum lease area a person can apply for is 100 acres. They requested that the proposed rule be retroactive, so it still would apply to the application in Maquoit Bay.
“We are concerned that aquaculture leases, especially large leases that are attractive to out-of-state investors will basically eat up the bottom of the ocean floor. We are seeing more and more large leases in the water,” said Julie Eaton, secretary and treasurer of the Maine Lobstermen’s Union.
But according to Dan Devereaux, co-owner of Mere Point Oyster Co. and Brunswick’s harbor master, the proposed rule changes would only “handicap the aquaculture industry moving forward” and is a disservice not only to the industry, but to Coastal Maine and the working waterfront, he said.
Requiring the Department of Marine Resources to look into alternate locations for sites only would “pump the brakes on a system that is already going slower than it should,” he said, especially given that oyster farmers choose their sites because they are familiar with the waters.
The oyster industry is “fitting in as our other resources are dwindling,” Devereaux said, adding that as coastal communities and local lobstermen try to combat warming waters, ocean acidification and invasive species, aquaculture is one way to prevent a future of “less work and more play on the water.”
Much of the conversation around local lease battles boils down to the effect of one aquaculture owner versus the interests of coastal property owners and fishermen. That characterization, however, distorts the fact that the aquaculture farms are simply the most visible facets of an entire oyster economy that has grown up along Maine’s working waterfront.
VALUE OF OYSTERS The value of Maine oysters has skyrocketed as oyster farms have sprung up in recent years. According to landings data from the Maine Department of Marine Resources, in 2011, a total of 603,415 pounds of oyster were brought in. By 2017, oyster farmers were hauling in more than four times that number, bringing in nearly 2.8 million pounds.
That growth spurt appeared to taper off in 2018 with 2,762,941 pounds — 33,276 pounds under the previous year — but the total value of the fishery has continued to increase.
From 2004 to 2011, the total value of Maine’s oyster fishery fluctuated from $1 million to $2 million annually. In 2018, Maine’s total oyster landings were valued at an all-time high of $7.2 million.
The $7.2 million figure refers only to the value of the oysters landed, not the economic effect of all the underlying businesses that support and rely on Maine oysters. According to Chris Davis, the executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center, when taking into account that interconnected web of businesses, the economic impact of Maine oysters nearly doubles to $13.6 million for 2018.
“That’s looking at any processing, margins on wholesalers and distributors, margins on retailers and supply chain,” Davis said.
In order to meet demand, a 2016 analysis published by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute called for the total amount of acreage devoted to shellfish aquaculture to essentially double by 2030. While that’s a significant push, under those projections shellfish aquaculture would use just 0.1% of the state’s water acreage. In 2016, shellfish leases covered 0.06% of state waters.
That analysis projected that Maine oyster production will almost triple by 2030. A higher estimate shows production nearly quadrupling. For that to happen, the amount of Maine’s coastal waters being devoted to aquaculture needs to increase substantially. It’s not entirely clear how proposals to stymie or discourage some leases could affect that projected growth.
Rand’s family has owned Hopkins Island and nearby mainland property for generations, but until recently the surrounding water was mostly empty. Over the past few years, the floating black tubes cropped up in a few locations around the island and farther out in the harbor as he pursued his dream of an oyster farm, which he hopes will allow him to bring about 100,000 oysters to market annually.
Rand said he’s noticed that applying for aquaculture licenses has grown more difficult in recent years, in part, he suspects, because of pressure from the controversy surrounding projects such as the one in Maquoit Bay.
“Interestingly, it was very easy at first, but I noticed with the last two that I had here there was a little more to it,” Rand said.
For the most part, opponents of projects such as the one proposed in Maquoit Bay have emphasized that their opposition is to large-scale operations, not the smaller Limited Purpose Aquaculture licenses (LPAs) such as Rand’s. LPAs are by definition small-scale operations, limited to just 400 square feet, and have to be renewed annually. Standard leases, such as the one being pursued in Maquoit Bay, can be granted for up to 20 years and 100 acres, although in Maquoit Bay the 40-acre lease application is for 10 years and owners Devereux and Doug Niven whittled down their active space to about 28 acres and increased the size of the navigable corridors in an attempt to mollify the opposition.
Opponents have labeled such projects “factories” on the water. But according to Davis, larger oyster farms are exactly what is necessary for continued growth.
The Department of Marine Resources approved an average of 17 new leases a year in the past five years, compared to six leases approved a year on average from 2009 to 2013, the Portland Press Herald reported in March.
“The LPAs have exploded, as we know. But that only represents 1% of the growing ground. It’s 6 acres out of close to 700 acres of shellfish. It’s really a tiny percentage in terms of production, since each one is only 400 square feet,” Davis said.
The real growth, said Davis, will be when the current LPAs expand and the owners apply for standard leases, like the one being sought by Mere Point Oyster Company in Maquoit Bay.
“That’s where we’re going to see the real growth,” said Davis. “There’s only so much you can produce on an LPA.”
While building up a strong local market for fresh oysters is important for many oyster farmers, one of the bigger goals is to grow out-of-state demand for Maine oysters. The 2016 Maine Farmed Shellfish Market Analysis notes that its best estimate for the continued growth of Maine’s oyster industry depends on expanding the reach of Maine oysters to large out-of-state markets.
A major part of that process will be building Maine oysters’ brand. Just like Maine lobsters, Maine oysters will need to develop a brand as a high-quality product, superior to oysters farmed further south.
The Gulf of Maine Research Institute analysis notes that Maine oysters should command a high price even with an increase in supply, largely because of the perceived high quality of Maine’s cold-water oysters. “They are the best oysters out there,” Rand said. “They’re terrific. There’s just a worldwide market potential for them.”

Full text: While the tornadoes get bigger and the wildfires burn, the politicians fiddle for money, writes Dana Wilde.
In Oklahoma this week, schools were closed because huge tornadoes were expected. An F-5 tornado had killed seven kids at a school in 2013, and officials decided the risk of a big twister this time was too great. On TV news, a mother said she was grateful for the decision.
“It never used to be like this,” she said.
Unusually severe tornadoes and storms have become more and more usual in recent years. The cause of the increases is climate change. The change is driven primarily by rising air and water temperatures.
The temperatures are rising because carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been rising for about 200 years as a result of human activities, mainly the waste from burning oil and coal. Animals are going extinct, oceans are rising, glaciers are melting, wildfires are destroying forestland, and unusually strong tornadoes are killing kids.
So what are we doing about it?
When the eight Arctic Council countries met earlier this month, they were unable to agree on a text mentioning “climate change” because one of the countries would not sign off on it. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, specifically. In his own public remarks, Pompeo instead pointed out that receding ice sheets would provide incredible opportunities for plundering the Arctic’s “undiscovered oil,” gas, uranium, gold, diamonds, “fisheries galore.”
While the tornadoes get bigger and the wildfires burn, the politicians fiddle for money.

BURNING • January through April this year was the third-hottest globally on record for that time period, NOAA reported this week.
• A recent study found that between 1980 and 1990, Greenland’s glaciers were melting at rate that sent about 51 billion tons of ice into the ocean. Between 2010 and 2018, 286 billion tons went into the ocean, meaning that of the nearly 14 millimeters of sea-level rise in total caused in Greenland since 1972, half of it has occurred since 2010. The researchers predict the ice losses will get worse.
• Another study found that increasing ocean temperatures have reduced the sustainable catch of 124 fish and shellfish species since 1938.
• Climate models developed for the United Nations’ 2021 assessment of global warming are starting to predict temperature rises so high (up to 5 degrees Celsius) that the scientists think the models must be faulty. Many previous models of global temperatures have underestimated the rises that actually occurred.
• A study published this month reports that rainfall increases in the Midwest between 1989 and 2016 were directly responsible
for reductions in corn crops of as much as 37%. Heavy precipitation events have increased by up to 42% in parts of the Midwest since 1958 and are expected to become more frequent and more intense as a result of climate change.
• A report by scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency indicates that if climate change continues unchecked, effects such as rising sea levels and lake and stream temperatures, longer pollen seasons, increases in harmful algal blooms, wildfires, flooding and disease-carrying insects, among other things, will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Some of the economic damage can be averted by taking immediate action, the report suggests. The human suffering, apparently, is a different matter.

FIDDLING • President Donald Trump’s budget plan for 2020 would cut 13% of National Institutes of Health funding, 12% of National Science Foundation funding and 16.5% of the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, hitting renewable energy and environmental research programs especially hard. The EPA and Interior, Agriculture and even Defense departments would see huge cuts to funding for science programs.
• Trump’s National Security Council has discussed forming an advisory committee whose mission will be to challenge the scientific consensus on climate change.
• In April, Trump signed executive orders that limit states’ abilities to regulate oil and gas projects.
• In April, the Senate confirmed David Bernhardt as secretary of the interior. Bernhardt is a former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry.
• In May, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement revised the Well Control Rule developed after the Deepwater Horizon disaster that poured about 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The revised rule relieves oil companies of many federal safety requirements and suggests they instead follow oil industry “recommended practices.”
• The Office of the Inspector General has opened an investigation into multiple conflict-of-interest complaints against Bernhardt.
• This month the U.S. House passed the Climate Action Now Act. It would prohibit federal funds from being used to leave the Paris Climate Accord, require the U.S. to comply with climate commitments, and require Trump to report within four months on plans to meet obligations. No Republicans supported it. It is unlikely to pass in the Senate because Republicans are the majority there.
• In April, the EPA published “Planning for Natural Disaster Debris,” offering advice for local planners on coping with the aftermath of floods, hurricanes and wildfires expected to increase in “frequency and intensity” as a result of climate change.
• In contrast, EPA Director Andrew Wheeler told a television interviewer that “most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out.” What, me worry?

FIGHTING CHANCES • German Chancellor Angela Merkel established a “climate cabinet” to plan for Germany to attain carbon-emissions neutrality by 2050.
• The British government has committed to phasing out coal-fired power by 2025.
• In March, a federal judge in Alaska declared a Trump order revoking a ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans illegal.
• A federal judge in Colorado who was appointed by Ronald Reagan ruled the approval by the Interior Department of two gas drilling plans was illegal, in part because the officials did not adequately consider environmental impacts in the plans.
• In February, the Senate passed, 98-2, a conservation bill that will protect millions of acres of land and rivers and establish four new national monuments.
• In April, Maine Gov. Janet Mills signed the nation’s first statewide ban on the use of Styrofoam food containers. The law takes effect Jan. 1, 2021.
How many schools have to get flattened by huge tornadoes, and towns and whole countries need to get swamped by hurricanes like Michael, Florence, Irma and Maria before dead children become more important than the oil, gold and diamonds in the Arctic, no one knows.

Don’t divide fishing industry

Full text: I have spent most of my life on the water employed in the commercial fishing industry, and so have generations of family and close friends. Lobstermen are a tight-knit group of men and women who work hard in a dangerous occupation — which, depending on the year, can have unpredictable rewards. We are an industry that is part of Maine’s iconic brand — the Maine lobster. The best in the world. A nearly $500 million-per-year industry.
Right now, what started as an effort to bring balance with a growing industry, aquaculture, has gotten ugly fast. I lobster in inner and outer Casco Bay. Last year we learned about an application to build a 40-acre oyster farm in rich fishing grounds in Maquoit Bay that I, along with more than a dozen lobstermen, have been fishing for decades. After we learned about it, we started attending the Department of Marine Resources hearings on the proposal and testifying to keep this section of the bay open to everyone.
Since this started, the Maine Aquaculture Association has intimated to legislators that we lobstermen are being paid for our efforts to be engaged with this process. That is not only completely untrue but also highly offensive and unhelpful, and it cuts to the heart of what we are trying to do — which is to work in cooperation with aquaculture. Not only are we not being paid, we have spent a lot of uncompensated time and own expense to simply to try to engage in this process.
I get a Department of Marine Resources notification every time someone applies for an aquaculture lease. What I typically now do is contact the applicants in the area I fish. I have spoken with some applicants who didn’t have a lot of experience and simply didn’t know that the spot they selected might cause conflict with established fisheries. So far, in two situations, we lobstermen agreed to work with them to help find a site that eliminates conflict and also provides them with what they need. With another aquaculture applicant, when I was called, I said that it was a good area for them because it wasn’t heavily fished. This is what this effort is all about from the lobstermen’s perspective – finding a workable solution.
Part of that solution has to be how DMR will address the transferability of aquaculture leases. Aquaculture is popular and growing — more than 46 aquaculture leases are currently pending. When someone gets a lease, they can transfer/sell it, and the larger the lease, the more attractive it is to larger out-of-state corporations.
We are literally selling our ocean. Everyone who fishes it, swims in it, boats on it has just lost a right they have had in favor of a business deal with the government. A side note: Lobstermen cannot sell their licenses, because it is against the law — but in aquaculture, a lease may be sold.
We urge the Department of Marine Resources to look at a better way to site these locations for aquaculture with very significant input from the commercial fishing community. The method for engaging in this process should not create a sudden burden on commercial fishermen. The burden should be placed on the state and the aquaculture applicant. Creating a healthy co-existence is our goal, not a competitive environment.
We urge DMR to consider developing across-the-board and consistent licensing policy by requiring the return of aquaculture leases to the state of Maine (just as lobster licenses must be) if someone doesn’t wants to hold them any longer, instead of selling our ocean to the highest bidder in order to let a new person in.
Finally, we urge the Maine Aquaculture Association to do some fact checking, to work with lobster fishermen and to avoid putting any further wedge between a very large and longtime, traditional fishing industry and a small but growing one.

Mills vows more than just hot air on climate

Full text: Governor says she'll fight to preserve the Maine she loves.
Governor pledges to fight to preserve Maine she loves

AUGUSTA — For Gov. Janet Mills, climate change isn’t just a matter of political debate.
For her, it’s an issue that cuts instead to the heart of what Maine is all about.
In one recent speech, the 71-year-old Mills wondered whether Mainers in the not-too-distant future “may not know the state we call home” if the issue isn’t dealt with.
She wondered whether her grandchildren, when they reach her age, will still hear “the singsong call of a black-capped chickadee or the smell of asters and lilies.”
“Will they know what the bark of a fir tree looks like or the grit of sand between their toes as they walk along the shores of Perkins Cove? With butter on their lips and sun on their faces, will they taste Maine in lobsters caught off Casco Bay?” she asked.
That concern, she said last week in her State House office, is what’s driving her to make climate change one of her top priorities as governor, in striking contrast to her predecessor, Gov. Paul LePage, who expressed little concern about a warming planet during his eight years in office.
Spurred by visions of a Maine remade amid catastrophic environmental change, Mills has put the state back in the fight to preserve the climate with a series of steps to reduce carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels — and more in the works.
With a Democrat-controlled Legislature that is generally favorable to her agenda, Mills said the state must act swiftly and broadly on a range of climate-change initiatives “before it’s too late.”
Researchers warn that the world — not only Maine — is running out of time to make serious changes or face rising temperature that will transform the environment.
Ivan Fernandez, a longtime science professor at the University of Maine, recently described for state lawmakers what climate change already is doing in the state.
“We have warming temperatures, shorter winters, less snow, a longer growing season, rising sea levels, the fastest-warming oceans on the planet, intensifying storms and increasing uncertainty and variability in weather that burdens communities and businesses across Maine,” he said.
In addition, Fernandez warned, “most of these trends are accelerating.”
Mills said the growing threat from climate change is the reason she wants to address it.
“Why care about ticks invading our woods and our public parks?” she asked rhetorically. “Why care about kids with high asthma rates? Why care about lobsters off the coast moving north? Why care about the diminished fisheries in cod and shellfish and herring? Why care about rising sea levels?”
“Because it’s Maine,” she answered, “and we value our clean water and clean air. We value our public health.”

A COMPLEX PROBLEM Susan Inches, a former deputy director of the State Planning Office who is teaching courses at Bates and Colby colleges about the need for environmental advocacy, said the state has “a tremendous opportunity at hand.”
“After eight years of division, there’s a hunger among Maine people to find hope and put Maine on a course that better serves everyone,” she recently told the Legislature’s Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.
As a first step, the new administration is trying to figure out in the broadest sense what its goals are.
Mills said she is aiming to ensure that Maine gets all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050, a standard that would require the development of far more solar and wind power. It also might rely on technology that doesn’t yet exist.
But the problem goes far beyond how electricity is generated, particularly since slightly more than half of the greenhouse gas emissions in Maine come from transportation, mostly cars and trucks.
In addition, more than two-thirds of Mainers heat their homes with oil, costing Mainers $5 billion a year and contributing to global warming.
Hannah Pingree, who heads Mills’ Office of Innovation and the Future, said the administration hopes to slash overall carbon emissions in Maine by 45% by 2030.
Melanie Loyzim, deputy commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, told legislators recently that her department “supports a clear and aggressive target” for greenhouse gas emissions that would reach an 80% reduction by 2050.
Those are tough numbers to attain, officials readily acknowledge.
To get there, they say, will require a complex mix of policy initiatives, possibly ranging from floating offshore windmills to feeding Maine-grown seaweed to cows that might reduce the volume of methane the animals naturally produce.
A new Maine Climate Council will coordinate the state’s efforts to address the problem.
Pingree said the council probably will have six groups within its structure to deal with science, transportation, energy and electricity, buildings and infrastructure, working lands, and coastal and marine issues.
The working lands group, for example, would look into a range of issues, including possible measures to sequester carbon — capturing it before it enters the atmosphere — so that it doesn’t add to the rising greenhouse levels, Pingree said.
The coastal group would look at such problems as rising sea levels and how to make sure streets beside the water don’t wind up with ocean waves lapping on the pavement, she said.
Pingree said the council would be more than a one-time task force. The idea is to lock the structure into law and to update its plans regularly as more data and scientific input become available.
Mills said the bottom line is that coping with climate change in Maine requires dealing with three basic areas: electricity, transportation and home heating.
BRINGING IT HOME For government leaders, issues as difficult as climate change can prove vexing, in part because they frequently require technical or scientific knowledge that few possess.
But sometimes, it’s a lot simpler than that.
For Mills, the advantages of switching from burning oil to using an electric heat pump are as obvious as her winter heating costs.
She said she plans to get a heat pump for her house in Farmington “because I’m tired of paying the oil bill.”
This month, she said, she actually ran out of oil — something many Mainers can sympathize with — and the bill to fill up her tank again “made me so mad.”
“This has got to stop,” Mills said she told herself. It shouldn’t cost her “thousands of dollars every winter in my home where it’s just me” much of the time.
A heat pump is the likeliest alternative, she said, because it will pay for itself pretty quickly.
Mills said many Mainers could benefit from doing the same, but people often can’t afford to buy them because even though they’d save over the long run, they don’t have the cash to make the initial investment.
Many people can’t afford proper heating as it is.
Campaigning across Maine, Mills said she saw quite a few “scary situations” with gas heaters beside beds and people using ovens for heat.
That’s why, she said, she pushed for a $15 million allocation as part of a deal for her support for a controversial proposed transmission line to bring Hydro-Québec electricity to Massachusetts, via Lewiston.
“My thinking was there’s a lot of middle-class people who buy heat pumps to put in their homes,” Mills said, but added that that’s not enough.
“I want to see every trailer park, every mobile home park, in Maine have heat pumps,” she said. “I want to see houses in the suburbs and ranch houses on the outskirts of the cities have heat pumps,” because their open construction, often on concrete slabs, make heat pumps the best option.

MEETING CLIMATE TARGETS Among the measures Mills is eyeing to reduce the state’s carbon footprint are more wind and solar energy production, along with the use of electricity-powered vehicles.
Mills said solar “has come down in price” and is increasingly competitive with any alternative.
She said she is especially excited about the possibilities offered for community solar projects, such as putting panels on schools, churches, libraries, community centers and “other places the public gathers.”
The governor said more solar also means more jobs in the solar field, an area in which Maine lags behind Massachusetts and a number of other states.
“For the most part, these jobs attract younger people who are excited about what they do, excited to contribute to the betterment of the community and do something for the environment.” Mills said.
More wind-generated electricity is a virtual certainty as well.
Mills said she moved quickly to reverse LePage’s moratorium on wind-power projects because there is an existing regulatory system that can review proposals adequately to ensure they will benefit the public.
She said she is also determined to press ahead in particular with the University of Maine’s wind energy project, Aqua Ventus, which would rely on “floating offshore wind platforms.”
“I don’t want to lose out on offshore wind,” Mills said.
U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, touted the project recently, as well, happy that she helped secure federal funds to allow a demonstration of the project off Monhegan Island, about 14 miles off Maine’s coast.
Rick Perry, the U.S. energy secretary, called the Aqua Ventus project a good first step.
He said that empowering states “to go develop these alternative sources of energy, whether it’s advanced nuclear reactors or whether it’s these offshore wind platforms, is very, very wise for us as a country.”
Transportation may be the toughest area for change in Maine, but officials said switching to cars, trucks and buses that rely on electricity would make a big dent in the state’s carbon output.
While less than 1 percent of Maine drivers rely on electric-powered vehicles today, Mills said the number is going to rise.
The state is putting money into programs to construct more charging stations, which Mills said will encourage tourism and help nudge people to give electric cars a shot.
In addition, Mills said, the state is going to help social service agencies buy electric vehicles. It’s doing the same with its own fleet.
Pingree said rebates for people who buy electric vehicles are also a possibility.
With everything in the works, the governor said, “Maine will be one of the top players in the electric vehicles” field, perhaps even the state with the most access to electric vehicles and charging stations.
“This is a way for people to save carbon and dollars,” Mills said.
Mills and Pingree said many possible approaches to climate change exist, and new ideas are emerging frequently.
“It’s very complicated. I don’t pretend to have all the answers,” Mills said.
Howver, she said, it’s important for the state to stay on top of the issue and to do what it can to limit the potentially dire impact of the changing climate.
It’s a job that will take decades, almost certainly lasting beyond the lifetimes of today’s leaders and perhaps even those of their children and grandchildren.
“I probably won’t be around then,” Mills said, “but I want to start us out on that road. Because we have to.”

Activists press for regulators to consider alternate sites before approving new farms

The public will get a chance to weigh in on tougher state rules for siting fish farms pushed by a group of activist landowners and lobster fishermen.
Organizers submitted a petition with 189 signatures last month to the Department of Marine Resources to put an immediate moratorium on aquaculture leases bigger than 10 acres and create a new rule that would make state regulators consider alternate locations before approving aquaculture leases. Petitioners got almost 40 more signatures than necessary to trigger a state rulemaking process.
Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher, in an April 10 letter to group spokeswoman Crystal Canney, said the department intends to hold a public hearing on the proposed regulations before June 1.
Demand for changes to aquaculture rules stems partially from an application from Mere Point Oyster Co. for permission to build a 40-acre oyster farm on Maquoit Bay in Brunswick. The proposal has been criticized by local landowners worried about the noise, smell and visual impact, and commercial fishermen worried it will impede access to lobster fishing waters.
Mere Point Oyster Co. has argued that its aquaculture site was chosen so it would not interfere with commercial fishing, and its owners say they are going to split their area up so boats can travel through. A company spokesman did not respond to an interview request Tuesday.
Department of Marine Resources staff held a multi-day public hearing on the company’s application this winter. The application is pending at the department.
The Brunswick proposal is the flashpoint in bubbling concerns about Maine’s fast-growing aquaculture industry. In the past five years, Maine has approved nine aquaculture leases a year, on average — compared to an average of seven leases a year approved from 2009 to 2013, according to the department. In some communities, the rapid growth of large shellfish farms has sparked opposition from nearby landowners and others.
The state’s current aquaculture evaluation process includes making sure a new lease will not interfere unreasonably with navigation, waterfront access, fishing or other uses of the area; result in unreasonable noise; or interfere with wildlife and marine habitat.

Full text: Trial in infant’s death postponed
BANGOR — The trial of a man charged with manslaughter in the death of a 6-month-old-boy in Millinocket is due to begin this week.
Jesse Mackin pleaded not guilty in 2016 in the death of Larry Lord Jr., who was the son of his girlfriend. The evidence will be heard by a judge, not a jury, at Mackin’s request. The trial begins Tuesday for Mackin, who’s was charged with manslaughter.
Mackin was living with the baby’s mother in Millinocket at the time. The baby died after being brought unresponsive to a hospital.
The baby was the son of Anthony Lord, who’s serving two life prison sentences for a shooting rampage that claimed two lives and injured four others in 2015. Lord said he was overcome with grief over his son’s death before the shootings.
Scallopers hope for better haul
PORTLAND — Maine’s scallop season is ending for the year amid hopes that fishermen had a stronger season than they did a year ago.
Fishermen harvest Maine scallops with dragger boats or by diving for the shellfish and collecting them by hand. The dragger season is over, and the dive season is finished everywhere except southern Maine, where it officially ends on April 20.
The state’s scallop fishery has rebounded from a low point in the mid-2000s, but it took a step back last year after several years of steady improvement. Fishermen harvested a little more than 560,000 pounds of scallop meat in 2018, down from more than 800,000 in 2017. The 2017 harvest was the most in 20 years.
State fishery managers said scheduled closures likely played a role in the drop.
Opening of wildlife park delayed
GRAY — The opening of a popular wildlife park in Maine will be delayed for a couple of days because of the state’s seemingly endless winter of 2019.
The Maine Wildlife Park in Gray was originally scheduled to open on Saturday, but the state said “the unseasonably cold spring and inches of snow in the last few days” have made that impossible. The park opened April 15.
Silver Airways returns to airport
BAR HARBOR — An airline that stepped in when another company canceled air service is returning to the Bar Harbor-Hancock County Airport this summer.
Brad Madeira, the airport’s manager, said Florida- based Silver Airways’ Saab SF-340B twin-engine aircraft will carry up to 34 passengers in daily trips between Bar Harbor and Boston’s Logan Airport during the busy part of the tourist season.
The Bangor Daily News reported that Alaska-based PenAir announced last May that it wasn’t renewing its contract, but Silver Airways quickly filled the void.
The airport has a year-round carrier, Cape Air, but airport officials say it’s important to have extra seats during the busy summer months.
Maine mulls latest paid leave bill
AUGUSTA — Maine could allow up to 12 weeks of paid family leave or 20 weeks of paid medical leave under a top Democrat’s bill.
The Legislature’s Labor and Housing Committee has scheduled a public hearing Friday.
Employee contributions would cover benefits and administrative costs under Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon’s bill. Employers or the state of Maine wouldn’t have to make mandatory contributions, though state funding will cover the program’s start-up costs.
Employees must have paid into the fund for at least 26 weeks in the previous year to qualify.
Employees could use family leave after the birth of a child and medical leave to address a personal medical issue. Lawmakers are considering other paid leave proposals. Supporters say if lawmakers don’t act, the matter could go to voters.
Compiled from wire reports
The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife oversees the park, which includes moose, bear and bobcats. The agency said much of the grounds at the park are still covered with snow, ice and puddles. However, park superintendent Curt Johnson said warmer and sunnier weather allowed the park to open on Monday.
Cold Maine town ready for smelts
COLUMBIA FALLS — It still feels like winter in Down East Maine, but a little town near the coast is still planning its annual tradition of heating up smelts.
The 2019 Annual Smelt Fry and Fisheries Celebration took place on Saturday in Columbia Falls. The town of about 560 residents hosted the celebration of smelts every year to raise interest in fisheries conservation.
Downeast Salmon Federation puts on the event. The group said the cold winter kept rivers iced until early April this year, but it was still able to stock up on the smelts. The little fish are typically fried and eaten whole. They’re the subject of conservation activism in Maine because of concerns about the sustainability of their population.

Intertidal lands hold promise

Full text: With the Maine Supreme Judicial Court’s recent ruling affirming that rockweed growing in the intertidal zone is private property, it is incumbent for coastal towns to levy property taxes and the state to develop tax policies that incentivize intertidal industries.
Intertidal lands are owned; they need to be taxed. The Colonial ordinance that was the basis for the ruling, despite a violent revolution that overthrew Colonial governance, was put in place to incentivize the development of shorefront infrastructure to support economic growth. In keeping with that, we must create tax policies that recognize the economic value of those lands for Maine’s marine sector, specifically the shellfish aquaculture and algae extraction industries. Taxes on intertidal lands and tax incentive systems similar to tree growth programs used in forestry will give shorefront landowners incentive to make their lands available for commercial access.
Intertidal lands are a vast and vital infrastructure for Maine’s economy in the face of rapid and catastrophic ecological change. The Gulf of Maine is the fastest-warming body of water in the world, and Maine’s entrepreneurial workers need access to intertidal lands for our waterfront economy to adapt.
Lobster, Maine’s largest and most valuable fishery, often lauded for its sustainability, is dependent on healthy marine ecosystems for bait: 2 pounds bait for every pound of catch, sourced from all over the world. The oceans are changing, absorbing carbon dioxide and heat from the atmosphere, and the federal government has slashed the herring quota because of a low level of newly born fish, creating a crisis for the lobster industry. Rising bait costs have already led to cutbacks in crew that have left people in my community unemployed and searching for other work.
Our second largest fishery, clamming, with 1/25th the value of lobster, has seen diminishing landings largely because of predation by the invasive green crab. Simple aquaculture gear and seeding efforts can control predation and increase yields, both for clams and other valuable bivalve species. In the face of changing ocean chemistry, shellfish hatcheries create controlled conditions for the vital larval stages of shellfish growth.
We have existing methodologies for intertidal shellfish aquaculture, and there is enormous room for innovation. It’s a booming business is other states and around the globe, but our ability to place gear in the intertidal zone is controlled by shorefront landowners who often oppose both intertidal and deep-water aquaculture proposals for solely aesthetic reasons; They don’t want to look at it.
Central to intertidal land disputes is the rockweed fishery. Contrary to the vocal and misleading campaign against it by a small group of shorefront landowners opposing its harvest, marine algae extraction is the most sustainable industry in Maine’s waters. Not only is it freakishly regenerative and abundant, but it also has direct impacts in combating climate change: It is extracting nitrogen and carbon dioxide from the ocean and sequestering it in soils, and as an animal feed supplement, it reduces cattle methane emissions by up to 80 percent, researchers in California and Australia have found. Marine algae extraction is an existing commercially viable industry that captures oceanic carbon and creates products that remediate the greenhouse-gas emissions of a major global polluter.
In Maine, with the largest coastline in the lower 48 states and the highest tides, rockweed is a vast resource — it grows on any intertidal particle large enough to anchor it in place. Along our coastline, we have the infrastructure to develop this industry, and it is incumbent on us to do so. The law court has affirmed intertidal land ownership, and we need taxes and tax incentive programs that recognize the economic value of those lands beyond the scenic views. Call Maine “Vacationland” for marketing purposes, but we need policies that support the people who live and work here.

Aquaculture has big potential

Full text: Missing from the ongoing conversation we Mainers are having about the proposed development of large-scale aquaculture projects in our state is an acknowledgment of the cascading benefits these projects would bring with them.
Beyond the impact of the fish they would produce, these farms would create jobs at multiple levels of our local workforce. They would promote growth in hatcheries, feed production, processing, waste reutilization, transportation, supplies, machinery, financial services and other industries.
For this and other reasons, we should welcome the aquaculture industry’s proposed investments in our state. If we are intentional and strategic, we can make Maine a hub of aquaculture production while adhering to the highest environmental and global sustainability standards.
Our Maine communities are not alone in the public discussions we are having about the future of aquaculture. Conversations like the ones in Belfast and Brunswick are occurring throughout rural areas of our coastal world. I just spent six months in Sweden, Iceland and Norway. In nearly every rural area I went, aquaculture is being viewed as part of a more sustainable economic future. In Maine, we have opportunities to transform our coastal communities into vibrant international centers of ocean farming systems excellence. In so doing, we can make them much more than seasonal tourist destinations. We can create jobs for those holding all levels of technical and college education.
I am sympathetic to, and believe we should take seriously, the concerns of our friends living in coastal communities. Aquaculture is a new concept to many. Few know about the wide diversity of jobs allied to aquaculture production, or about the local and global benefits of eating sustainably farmed seafood. Like many Mainers, I am proud to reside in a state that values the natural world and take seriously our responsibility to preserve Maine’s many wonders. And it is true that all food systems have social and ecological impacts. But Mainers must understand that the types of recirculating aquaculture systems proposed for Maine are rapidly evolving and the industry is routinely adopting technological, transportation and market advances that are dramatically decreasing aquaculture’s environmental footprint.
I believe Maine should invest in world-class education, research and outreach to become a global leader in aquaculture. We can make our state not only a center of sustainable aquaculture production but also a center of sustainable aquaculture value and expertise, one that localizes the value chain of the projects we attract.
We should emulate the best standards available and embrace the guidance given by international organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Global Aquaculture Alliance and the Aquaculture Certification Council, which reflect the high standards we need and possess the global influence to move Maine aquaculture forward to international prominence.
At the University of New England, we are playing our part by developing real-world marine aquaculture farms and a land-based recirculating training facility, and offering traditional degree programs in marine biology, as well as programs in aquaculture, marine entrepreneurship and ocean food systems. We are also connecting partners from across the North Atlantic to draw from each other’s knowledge and collaborate.
To grasp the scope of Maine’s present opportunity, we need look no farther than to Charlotte County, New Brunswick. Aquaculture has transformed this rural community marked by high unemployment and low income. Salmon aquaculture now accounts for 26 percent of its employment income, having stimulated growth far beyond production alone. About 100 aquaculture service companies now operate in St. George, supplying goods and services such as processing, nets, maintenance, transportation, packaging and equipment.
This is an important time for Maine. Companies in a burgeoning industry see our state as ideal for their operations. In making our communities hospitable to them and developing projects in environmentally sustainable ways, we can maximize the local value chains they create.
At the same time, we can capitalize on a tremendous branding opportunity. Think of “Vermont maple syrup” or “Idaho potatoes,” and the contributions they make to their states’ images. We are fortunate to already possess signature products like “Maine blueberries” and “Maine lobster.” Now we can add to our portfolio by defining Maine as a state on the cutting edge of the aquaculture industry.
“Maine salmon,” “Maine oysters” and “Maine sushi” have a nice ring to them, don’t they?

Full text: Liz Soares writes she is pleased that 'the concept of plant-based diets is entering the national conversation.'
In a well-known “Far Side” cartoon, drawn by Gary Larson, a group of cavemen triumphantly carry a huge carrot over their heads through a forest. The caption: “Early vegetarians returning from the kill.”
OK, that’s funny. But the benefits of plant-based diets aren’t.
Vegetarians and vegans are the frequent butt of jokes and derision. Last month, the “VegNews” website reported the reaction of a Fox News panel to comments made by Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker, of New Jersey. He had discussed “the environmentally damaging effects of industrial animal agriculture” in an interview with the news site. The panelists on “The Five” opinion show “attempted to belittle Booker’s stance between bites of various meat products set up on the table between them,” VegNews reported.
Meanwhile, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., tweeted a picture of herself eating a steak: “Hey, Cory Booker. I support PETA — people eating tasty animals.”
I am pleased that the concept of plant-based diets is entering the national conversation, not just through Booker’s comments but through the proposed “Green New Deal.” One of the aims of the Democratic bill is to reduce greenhouse gases, and cows are copious producers of methane. But I am tired of the silliness, such as Fox News hosts telling viewers to lock up their meat supplies.
President Trump tweeting about the Democrats eliminating all cows? Yawn. That is so 20th century.
I quit eating beef and pork in 1985, actually after receiving literature from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. I was in my 20s and had no idea how veal was produced. I was horrified to learn about the conditions in which calves were kept. After my epiphany, I cooked no poultry or fish, but I did eat it when necessary in restaurants, and when I was a guest in other people’s homes.
That was morally inconsistent, but it was the best I could do in those days. As time passed, I found more vegetarian options. Then, later, I was able to find organic poultry that had been raised humanely, sometimes even locally.
Now I’ve swung back to eating home-cooked fish or shellfish once a week, as well as my guilty pleasure, Applegate organic turkey hot dogs. They are delicious with B&M vegetarian baked beans.
I eat a mostly plant-based diet because I believe factory-farming methods are inhumane. Why is it OK for me to keep dogs, cats and chickens as pets, coddling them, while not caring that pigs are typically raised in confinement? But I am also concerned about the environmental ramifications of our meat-centric society. North Carolina has a major pork industry, the by-products of which create a mess when there are floods — which, of course, there are more of these days, because of climate change.
Then there are all those flatulent cows.
I also think plant-based diets are healthier. The book “The Blue Zones,” by Dan Buettner, highlights places in the world where people live longer than average. One of them is Loma Linda, Calif., home to many Seventh-day Adventists. They exercise and abstain from alcohol and tobacco. Perhaps most importantly, they don’t eat meat.
I’m not quietly advocating for everyone to go veg. I want better — much better — conditions for farm animals. That is my passion. But I would really like to see a greater awareness that meat doesn’t have to be part of every meal. That’s not healthy, nor it is necessary. Chinese, Indian, Mexican and Italian cuisines all have vegetarian, and even vegan, options. There are meat alternatives that are getting better-tasting all the time. I prefer the ones that are soy-based.
Or as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a sponsor of the Green New Deal, said in her inimitable way (according to Vice News), “It’s not to say you get rid of agriculture. It’s not to say we’re going to force everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that. … It’s to say, listen, we’ve got to address factory farming. Maybe we shouldn’t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like, let’s keep it real.”
Sorry, Sean Hannity, your scare tactics are passé. Lately, when I’ve been registering for work-related workshops or conferences, the “vegan” option has started popping up on the menu. The other day, in my own school district, on a professional development day, the veggie pizza ran out before I could get any. It was that popular.
I’m on the planning committee for an annual librarians’ conference, and last year, there was a minor uproar when the vegan soup disappeared too quickly, leaving only the alternative soup. This year, the soup will be strictly vegan.
And that’s no joke.

Lobstermen seek aquaculture site cap

Full text: Lobstermen and concerned citizens submit a petition to the state to halt new aquaculture leases and put more restrictions on where new aquaculture leases should be sited.
Lobstermen are among the organizers of a citizen petition asking the state to limit where new aquaculture operations are sited in Maine’s coastal waters, claiming the surge in new licenses affects where they can drop traps.
A wave of aquaculture operations has swept along the coast in the last few years, sparking concerns from lobstermen and others about waterfront access, aesthetics and interference with commercial fisheries.
A 40-acre oyster farm proposed in Maquoit Bay in Brunswick by Mere Point Oyster Co. is a flashpoint in the debate. The hearing on its application prompted three days of prolonged, contentious discussion, involving landowners in the upscale neighborhood of Merepoint, members of the town’s fishing community and others.
“I’m here to let the Department of Marine Resources know that their system of granting aquaculture leases is broken or even worse, non-existent, as far as it pertains to the commercial lobstermen in this state,” John Powers, a lobsterman who has fished around Brunswick for 40 years, said Wednesday at a news conference in the State House.
Powers was among a handful of organizers who submitted a petition with 189 signatures to the Department of Marine Resources, almost 40 more signatures than needed to trigger the rule-making process.
The department’s current aquaculture evaluation process includes making sure a new lease will not interfere unreasonably with navigation, waterfront access, fishing or other uses of the area; result in unreasonable noise; or interfere with wildlife and marine habitat.
Petitioners want an immediate statewide moratorium on pending lease applications bigger than 10 acres. A map of the state aquaculture operations shows several larger than 10 acres, but a DMR spokesman was unable to provide an exact number.
They also want the state to add rules that would allow it to consider whether a nearby location or different lease boundaries would balance competing water uses better.
The group wants its rules to be retroactive to the pending Mere Point Oyster Co. lease application.
“I ask the DMR to listen carefully to the generations of men and women who have made the lobster industry what it is today and protect our livelihood from what has become nothing more than a land grab in upper Casco Bay,” Powers said.
Julie Eaton, who fishes for lobster from Stonington and is head of the Maine Lobstering Union, worries that rich people from out-of-state would use big aquaculture leases to deny ocean access to people who have relied on it for decades, specifically the lobster industry, Maine’s most valuable fishery.
“It’s time for thoughtful reconsideration of the rules to protect one of Maine largest industries — the lobstering industry,” Eaton said at the news conference Wednesday.
But Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, said the petition is just a smokescreen to drum up opposition to the Mere Point project. New leases already are prohibited from places with active commercial fisheries under current law, he said.
The petitioners are using a few local fishermen to mask opposition to the Mere Point Oyster Co. project from a local landowner concerned the project will ruin his view, not fearing it will affect the fishing industry, Belle added.
“Because under the existing system there are no criteria that would deny an application for visual impact, (the landowner) has had to go and pit commercial fishermen against aquaculture,” Belle said. “We have never seen the commercial fishing industry used as a proxy for wealthy landowners before, and that is obviously what is going on here.”
A Department of Marine Resources spokesman said the state first must confirm that the petition complies with Maine law, and if it does, the state can begin the rule-making process within 60 days.
Dan Devereaux, Brunswick harbor master and a partner in of Mere Point Oyster Co., said the company picked its site specifically because it did not conflict with lobstering or other fisheries.
The company also has shrunk its active area to about 28 acres and agreed to have east-west and north-south corridors to allow other fishermen to access the site, Devereaux said.
The driving issue is coastal landowners concerned with losing their views, not threats to fishermen, Devereaux added.
A group called Save Maquoit Bay has organized against the proposed lease, calling it a “floating factory.”
“Trying to package it up and couch it with creating fear from lobstermen that we are taking over the waters is ludicrous in my opinion,” Devereaux said.
Mere Point’s lease application went through its public hearing process this winter and awaits a final decision from the Department of Marine Resources. If the lease is approved, Mere Point Oyster Co. plans to grow from 350,000 oysters this year to 1 million in 2021.
“It’s too bad. It seems like the beef is with Mere Point Oyster Co., and the rule change they are asking for would impact aquaculture development up and down the coast of Maine,” Devereaux said.
Aquaculture is regarded by many as a crucial way to preserve and grow Maine’s commercial fisheries in the face of rapid changes to the ecosystem such as warming sea water and ocean acidification, which threaten natural stocks.
In the past five years, aquaculture operations have blossomed along the Maine coast.
The Department of Marine Resources approved an average of 17 new leases a year in the last five years, compared to six leases approved a year on average from 2009 to 2013, according to a review of department lease decisions.
American oysters have emerged as the pre-eminent crop for new aquaculture companies. Oysters grown in Maine waters are highly sought after by chefs and restaurants across the U.S. and Canada, and they fetch higher prices than those from other parts of the country.
The value of Maine’s farmed oysters more than doubled in five years, from about $3.1 million in 2013 to $7.2 million in 2017, according to state records.

Full text: After years of inaction, the U.S. Congress appears poised to direct federal authorities to assess the risk posed to coastal communities and fishing and aquaculture interests by ocean acidification, a byproduct of global warming that represents a potentially catastrophic threat to harvesters in Maine. Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democrat representing Maine’s first district, on Thursday reintroduced a bill directing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work with state and local experts to assess the likely impacts of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge.
Problem affects shell growth of clams, oysters and others, threatening marine harvesters
After years of inaction, Congress appears poised to direct federal authorities to assess the risk posed to coastal communities and fishing and aquaculture interests by ocean acidification, a byproduct of global warming that represents a potentially catastrophic threat to harvesters in Maine.
Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democrat representing Maine’s 1st District, reintroduced a bill Thursday directing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to work with state and local experts to assess the likely impacts of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge.
The bill, first introduced more than three years ago, never received so much as a hearing while Republicans controlled the U.S. House, despite bipartisan support, including that of then-Rep. Bruce Poliquin, the Republican from Maine’s 2nd District. With Democrats now in the majority, Pingree is bullish on the bill’s prospects.
“We’ve had eight years with Republican control of the House where we didn’t even have legislative hearings on these things or debate on the floor,” she told the Press Herald. “Now there’s a very good chance that something like this will move, as it’s not something I’ve had to struggle with to get Republicans to support.”
Pingree’s bill, the Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act, directs NOAA to prepare a public report on which communities are most exposed to the problem, identify gaps in knowledge that need to be filled, and support state efforts to assess their own vulnerabilities. The bill has six co-sponsors, half of whom are Republicans representing coastal districts. (Rep. Jared Golden, the Democrat who replaced Poliquin, is not among them, but his spokesman, Nick Zeller, said the congressman fully supports the bill and intends to be a co-sponsor.)
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Thursday reintroduced her companion bill in the Senate, co-sponsored by Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins and two Democrats, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.
“If we don’t develop the tools we need to assess and respond, our coastal communities will be hit the hardest by ocean acidification,” Murkowski said in a statement. “The reality is our ocean is becoming more acidic and will impact our ocean resources, coastal communities, and beyond if we don’t take proactive steps to address it.”
Collins said via email that it is “critical that we learn more about the impact of ocean acidification in order to protect the environment, our way of life, and Maine’s economy” and that she also supports “robust funding” for NOAA’s Ocean Acidification Program, which studies the problem.
Sen. Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said via email that ocean acidification poses a serious threat to the state’s ecosystems and coastal industries. “We must develop long-term strategies that combat ocean acidification and work every day to mitigate the impacts of climate change so we can support the livelihood of Maine families, and protect our environment for future generations,” King said. “I applaud this bipartisan effort, and am planning to support it as the process ensues.”
Ocean acidification is linked to the increased carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere, which are more than 70 percent higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution, and now stand at the highest level in at least 800,000 years. The levels would be worse but for the fact that the oceans absorb some of that additional carbon dioxide. However, that has caused them to become 30 percent more acidic over this period, conditions that interfere with the chemical processes by which clams, oysters and other organisms grow their shells.
Researchers in the Gulf of Maine have documented that free-floating, soft-shell clam larvae avoid burrowing into more acidic mud, which means they spend more time exposed to predators as they seek appropriate habitat; that acidic water conditions stunt clam growth; and that baby oysters have so much trouble building their first shells in acid conditions they often die before they’re completed. The effects on lobster, Maine’s most valuable fishery, remain unclear pending additional research.
Maine lawmakers are also upbeat about prospects for action on the state level.
Rep. Lydia Blume, a York Democrat, said her bill to convene another science advisory panel to look at the impact of climate change on Maine’s marine species is headed for committee review. A second one that would establish a commission to identify physical climate change threats to Maine’s coast, like those resulting from sea level rise and more intensive storm activity, is expected to be rolled into a larger climate bill being drafted by Gov. Janet Mills’ staff.
“These efforts are looking very positive, and it looks like the governor is staying true to her word on putting together a comprehensive plan,” Blume said. “To my mind, this requires an all-out effort by every aspect of the state’s departments.”

Full text: Do you remember when:
Maine hunters and fishermen had never seen a tick unless they travelled far south? No one in Maine had ever been sickened or killed by a tick-borne disease?
Mosquitos were a nuisance and not a potential threat to life and health? There was a Maine shrimp fishery?
Hundred-year storms were really rare? Portland’s back bay and waterfront rarely flooded? Clams and eelgrass were abundant and green crabs were only an occasional nuisance?
Shellfish farmers weren’t concerned about water pH preventing shell development? Coastal towns did not need to plan around projected sea-level rise?
All New England coastal states had a productive lobster fishery? Owning property “on the ocean” was always a good thing? The gardening season really began at Memorial Day and ended about Labor Day?
If you remember some or all of these things, you know that major change are happening to our world. These changes are only some of the easily observable local effects of climate change. Climate change is here, it’s happening now, and future projections are dire unless Congress acts quickly and decisively to control the release of greenhouse gasses.
A bill that will do that without adding more regulations or growing the government, The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763) has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives with bipartisan support. The bill is effective, good for people, good for the economy, bipartisan and revenue neutral.
I encourage you to educate yourself about the bill then contact your U.S. representative — Chellie Pingree or Jared Golden — to support this bill.

Full text: Sentencing delayed for former priest
ALFRED — The sentencing of a former Massachusetts priest for sexually assaulting an altar boy on trips to Maine years ago has been pushed back to late March.
Ronald Paquin was found guilty of 11 of 24 counts of gross sexual misconduct in November. Court officials said he’s scheduled to be sentenced at York County Superior Court in Alfred on March 29 at 9 a.m.
Paquin was initially scheduled for sentencing on Tuesday, but court officials said the date was extended.
A pair of men who testified during Paquin’s trial said they were altar boys when the priest invited them on trips in the 1980s and assaulted them repeatedly.
Paquin previously spent more than 10 years in a prison in Massachusetts for sexually abusing an altar boy in that state.
LePage: Electoral College helps whites
BANGOR — Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage said any elimination of the Electoral College would hurt white people.
LePage told WVOM radio that allowing the popular vote to choose the president would give minorities more power and that “white people will not have anything to say.”
Proposals to eliminate the Electoral College are sometimes floated but fail to gain traction. A Maine legislative committee plans to discuss a proposal this week.
LePage said cutting the Electoral College would mean there is never another presidential candidate from small states like “Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Wyoming, Montana, Rhode Island.”
While governor, LePage blamed out-of-state, minority dealers for bringing drugs into Maine and added that they often impregnate “young, white” girls while in Maine.

Abandoned bear cub now doing well
EDINGBURG — A Maine wildlife biologist said one of the bear cubs that nearly froze to death is doing well after being placed with a surrogate den.
The Bangor Daily News documented Randy Cross as he checked on the cub Wednesday. He easily recognized the young bruin because of signs of frostbite on the tips of its ears.
Then the cub was placed back in the den.
Three cubs were placed in new dens after being abandoned Jan. 31 when a piece of logging machinery passed close to their den. Their mother fled the ruckus, and didn’t immediately return, and the logger contacted the Maine Warden Service for help.
The cub that was checked on Wednesday was placed in Edinburg. The other two were placed with a mother bear in Orneville.
Jackson Labs joins Sanofi on research
BAR HARBOR — A laboratory in Maine is announcing a multimillion-dollar collaboration with pharmaceutical giant Sanofi to try to tackle two kinds of cancer.
Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor said Thursday it has signed a research agreement for up to $4.2 million with Sanofi to identify new targets to treat triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian carcinoma. The lab describes triple-negative as the most deadly form of breast cancer, and ovarian cancer as ranking fifth in cancer deaths among women.
Jackson Laboratory professor Jacques Banchereau said the laboratory is hopeful its work will lead to a new therapy that helps patients suffering from the cancers. Jackson Laboratory said Banchereau’s lab uses unique computational algorithms to inform cancer research work.
The lab said the approach could facilitate “more targeted and effective treatments” for disease.
New England fish forum kicks off
ROCKPORT — New England’s largest fishing industry trade show is getting started with a focus on the region’s shellfish business.
Thursday was the first day of the 2019 Maine Fishermen’s Forum. The event runs through Saturday. Organizers said Thursday was the event’s “Shellfish Focus Day.”
The day included seminars about outreach and education in the shellfish industry, as well as about shellfish science and management of shellfish species. The shellfish business is a major piece of the fishing industry in New England, where fishermen harvest scallops, softshell clams, quahogs are other valuable species from the Atlantic Ocean and coastal areas.
Maine fishing regulators are expected to release new data about the state’s valuable lobster haul during the three-day forum.

WATERVILLE — A Maine group is looking for local art submissions for the state’s annual summer film festival.
The Maine Film Center said it wants “original Maine-based art submissions” for the 22nd Annual Maine International Film Festival’s artwork. The selected artwork will be used on posters, programs, advertisements and other materials in support of the festival.
The festival is set to take place from July 12 to 21 in Waterville. The Maine Film Center is also looking for artists to participate in the festival’s interactive art exhibit, which is called “MIFFONEDGE.”
The artist behind the selected artwork will be offered $1,000 and a full festival pass.
Whiteouts cause crashes in Maine
CYR PLANTATION — State police in Maine said whiteout conditions in northern Maine have made driving conditions dangerous and resulted in several crashes.
Police said the crashes happened in northern Aroostook County on Tuesday morning. Spokesman Steve McCausland said the trouble area is U.S. Route 1 in Cyr Plantation, just south of the town of Van Buren.
McCausland said six vehicles including a Maine Department of Transportation plow truck have been involved in crashes. He said blown snow in the area reduced visibility to zero and the road was closed.
Some injuries were reported as a result of the crashes. The extent of the injuries and the names of the people involved were not immediately available.
Two malls in Maine listed for auctions
BANGOR — Two Maine malls have now gone up for auction.
California-based auction house Ten-X is advertising separate auctions for the Bangor Mall and Aroostook Centre Mall in Presque Isle on its website. The auction for the Bangor Mall is scheduled for late February with a minimum bid price of $6.5 million.
The mall is listed as having about 531,000 square feet of rentable space.
There are few details available for the Presque Isle mall’s upcoming auction, with no auction date or bid price listed.
Gov. Mills launches Twitter account
AUGUSTA — Gov. Janet Mills is launching new official public accounts on social media.
Mills, a Democrat, was elected last year and took office this month. Mills and her office staff will maintain her new accounts, which are @GovJanetMills on Twitter, @GovernorJanetMills on Facebook and @governorjanetmills on Instagram.
Mills said in a statement she does not expected to be “as prolific a tweeter as the president,” adding that she thinks “that is a good thing.”
She said the accounts will be used for sharing information with state residents and putting a spotlight on the work of her administration.

Shellfish research up for hearing
AUGUSTA — A proposal to expand shellfish research in Maine is up for a public hearing in the state’s capital city this week.
Democratic Rep. Robert Alley of Beals made the proposal, which would change municipalities’ shellfish conservation ordinances. Those ordinances regulate possession of shellfish, and where the shellfish can be taken.
The proposal would allow research groups to conduct shellfish research in conjunction with state authorities or a professional entity that is approved by the state to support shellfish conservation. The proposal is before the legislative Committee on Marine Resources.
The hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. on Thursday in the Cross Building in Augusta.

Full text: try to take
on climate monitoring
Lawmakers optimistic bill to tackle warming gulf water will advance
After years of inaction, Maine finally might deal with the effects of climate change along the coast, including ocean acidification, a byproduct of global warming that represents a potentially catastrophic threat to Maine’s marine harvesters.
More than four years ago, a bipartisan panel of experts convened by the Legislature issued a series of recommendations for Maine policymakers to respond to the acidification in the Gulf of Maine, which weakens clams and other shell-building animals and has been implicated in die-offs at mussel farms and oyster hatcheries. Despite dire warnings from scientists, clammers and hatchery owners, Republican legislative leaders and the administration of former Gov. Paul LePage declined to take substantive action.
But lawmakers in the new Democratic majority say they are moving to make up for lost time on this and other climate-related challenges to the Gulf of Maine, which has been the second-fastest-warming part of the world ocean for the better part of the past two decades. The moves come amid a flood of worrying climate news, including a study released Thursday in the journal Science that found the oceans are warming 40 percent faster than a United Nations panel had estimated just five years ago and a report issued Tuesday that found U.S. carbon emissions had increased for the first time in three years.
“When I first started fighting to address climate threats, I wanted to fight for everything, but I couldn’t get Republican support for anything but ocean acidification,” said Rep. Mick Devin, D-Newcastle, a marine scientist who has reintroduced a bill to fund the acidification monitoring system recommended by the expert panel, which he co-chaired. “Even though we knew it was being caused by too much carbon being emitted into the atmosphere, we couldn’t even talk about that five or six years ago.”
“Now,” he notes, “we’re out of the closet.”
Much of the optimism stems from Gov. Janet Mills’ Jan. 2 inaugural address, in which the first policy issues she raised were the effects of climate change on Maine’s ocean and forests. “Our coastal waters are growing acidic: Temperatures are fluctuating and sea levels are rising, endangering our shellfish industry,” she said. “Climate change is threatening our jobs, damaging our health and attacking our historic relationship to the land and sea.
“Tonight I say, enough. Enough with studies, talk and debate,” she added. “It is time to act.”
Democrats also now control both houses of the Legislature and no longer must persuade climate change skeptics in the Republican caucus to take action.
Devin has introduced a bill that would ask voters to approve a $10 million bond issue to finance one of the ocean acidification panel’s top recommendations: targeted data collection, monitoring and assessments of the effect on wildlife and commercial fish species.
A bill introduced by Rep. Lydia Blume, D-York, would convene another science advisory panel to look at the effect of climate change on Maine’s marine species, which reflects another of the 2014 panel’s top recommendations. “We need to have a monitoring program, but we also need to know what that program will monitor for, to decide what is needed and where,” she said. “The scientists on this panel will identify the data we have and the data we will need to establish what climate change is doing to our marine ecosystem.”
A second Blume bill would establish a Coastal Risks and Hazards Commission to identify physical — rather than ecological — threats to Maine’s coast, such as those resulting from sea level rise and more intensive storm activity. The commission is modeled after one already created in New Hampshire. It received legislative approval last session before being vetoed by LePage.
“It’s really important that we do this work and that we elevate and respect science when we develop policy, which hasn’t been done,” Blume said. “Climate change issues are enormously consequential, and there’s a moral imperative to deal with them.”
Gulf of Maine sea surface temperature in 2018 ran 2.8 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, making it the third-warmest year in the 37-year satellite record and triggering the starvation of puffin chicks off the Maine coast, mass strandings of sea turtles in Massachusetts and renewed concerns about the survival of endangered right whales. The only warmer years were 2012 and 2016.
The Gulf of Maine is experiencing rapid warming in part because it is vulnerable to shifts in the relative strength of the frigid Labrador Current — which normally feeds the gulf — and the warm-water Gulf Stream, which can intrude when the cold current weakens. The Labrador Current is feared to be weakening as a side effect of the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, resulting in warmer water flowing into the gulf.
The effects for the Gulf of Maine can be dramatic for human and marine life alike. The 2012 “ocean heat wave” caused lobsters to shed six weeks ahead of their usual schedule, throwing off the timing of Maine’s soft-shell harvest and leading to conflicts with New Brunswick fishermen over access to Canadian lobster processing facilities. The population of green crabs exploded, and they devoured most of the clams in Freeport, Brunswick and other towns, tearing up seagrass beds in many bays.
Ocean acidification compounds the dangers to Maine’s shellfish-dependent fisheries and aquaculture sectors. The problem is tied to the increased carbon dioxide levels in the Earth’s atmosphere, which are more than 70 percent higher than they were before the Industrial Revolution and now stand at the highest level in at least 800,000 years. The levels would be worse but for the fact that the oceans absorb some of that additional CO2, but that’s caused them to become 30 percent more acidic over this period, conditions that interfere with the chemical processes by which clams, oysters and other organisms grow their shells.
Under President Donald Trump, the federal government also has shied away from substantive action on these issues, and the United States has pulled out of the Paris climate change accord, the primary mechanism by which the world’s nations have tried to respond.
In April, U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King, of Maine, wrote to the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Tim Gallaudet, urging his agency to enhance monitoring of the subsurface conditions affecting the Gulf of Maine, which they said was “critical not just for Maine and New England states but for our country as a whole.” NOAA responded with a description of the status quo, suggesting the Trump administration did not intend to increase monitoring resources.
For more than three years, congressional leaders failed to schedule a hearing on a bipartisan bill introduced by Maine’s U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, and co-sponsored by then-Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-2nd District, that would have directed NOAA to assess the likely effects of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge. Pingree has said she intends to reintroduce the bill now that the U.S. House is under Democratic control.

Full text: Your Dec. 16 lead editorial, "Our View: Aquaculture wrong target for protests," misses the mark.
We who oppose the construction of a massive industrial fish farm in Belfast didn't file suit to kill the project by delay -- we filed suit because the Belfast City Council illegally changed our long-standing zoning laws to accommodate the highly destructive Nordic Aquafarms industrial fish farm project.
The editorial poses a false choice between one polluting industry, land-based industrial aquaculture, and other polluting industries such as poultry. But there are alternatives. The Green Wave kelp-based aquaculture model actually renews our beleaguered oceans and provides far more jobs per dollar invested.
Industrial fish production is not the most efficient or sustainable way to feed a hungry and growing human population, not even close. Kelp, shellfish, actively supported wild-fish harvesting and organic plant-based protein such as soy are all much more efficient and sustainable.
Industrial fish production has an extensive carbon footprint. Its effluent discharge creates algae blooms and large dead zones in our seas.
It requires the importation from Asia and South America of large quantities of forage fish, which decimates fish populations in those areas, and it requires the importation of pesticide-laced soy from industrial soy farms that are destroying the Amazon.
The editorial touts jobs and financial benefit, but here in Belfast, Nordic Aquafarms has made at least 30 hires, none of whom was living in Belfast when hired. Any tax benefits will be minimized by a veritable smorgasbord of tax-incentive programs and giveaways and a reduction in state education aid.
And profits from the project will flow out of our community and into the coffers of a foreign corporation.
All told, this big industrial model is the wrong way forward for our community.

Market reaps holiday reward

Full text: In the hectic countdown to Christmas, it's well-known that stores, shopping malls and groceries are going to be thronged with people doing their final rounds before the holiday.
A seafood market doesn't immediately jump to mind as someplace that would have shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. But that's exactly what greeted anyone walking through the front door of Harbor Fish Market on Custom House Wharf in Portland on Sunday morning.
The weeks leading up to Christmas and New Year's are the busiest period of the year at the store, said owner Mike Alfiero.
"When this time of year comes, people go on a buying frenzy," Alfiero said.
Some of the demand is linked to traditions such as like the multi-course fish feast his Italian-American family enjoyed when he was growing up, Alfiero said. For others, it is an excuse to indulge in some special holiday foods.
"It is the one time of year when people, as much as they can afford it, drop their guards on how much they are willing to spend," he said.
The store was so busy Sunday morning that a policeman and employee dressed in a Santa costume were directing traffic into parking spaces on the narrow wharf.
Inside, customers crowded around glass cases lined with ice, succulent cuts of fish and piles of oysters, clams, mussels and shrimp. Employees scooped live lobsters from huge, gurgling saltwater tanks.
A line of about 20 people, plastic bags weighted down with their selections, waited to check out at the counter. The lengthy line barely changed, as a steady stream of customers jockeyed for standing space on the damp concrete floors. Workers hustled to weigh purchases and lugged ice and fish from the back warehouse into the front.
Today, Christmas Eve, will likely be even busier, with customers lining up before the store opens at 7 a.m. The market brings on about 10 temporary employees to deal with the rush. Alfiero could not estimate how much fish the market sells during the holiday season, but the store does the same sales in the two weeks around Christmas and New Year's as it does during a busy month in the summer.
Chris Anderson, 37, was picking out three dozen oysters and two dozen clams for a holiday dinner. His sister-in-law Chelsea Obourn, was bringing some home with her to Rochester, New York.
Christmas seafood isn't really a tradition in her family, but her grandfather has a soft spot for oysters, Obourn said. Most of the oyster selections were from Maine, but she made sure to get some from Wellfleet, Massachusetts, near where he owned a beach home.
"My grandpa loves it," she said. "He has had some health problems, but it is one of the only things he has an appetite for anymore."
It is not unusual to have a lot of out-of-state customers over the holidays, Alfiero said. Some people make the trip to Portland year after year, bringing generations to select premium fresh seafood the market is known for.
"A lot of people see coming here and shopping in the store as a tradition," he said.
The weathered row of buildings along Custom House Wharf has been a fish market since the late 1800s. The Alfiero family bought the business in 1966 and Mike Alfiero now runs it with his brother Nick.
Some customers are coming in to prepare for the Feast of the Seven Fishes, a holiday tradition for Italian-American families like his own, Alfiero said. The idea is to serve seven different seafood dishes, or seafood prepared seven different ways, for Christmas dinner. The precise origin of the tradition is unclear, but it likely developed among Italian immigrant families in the U.S. It is rooted in the Roman Catholic custom of not eating meat before important holidays.
For Alfiero's family, Christmas meant dishes such as stuffed squid, fried eels, baccalà -- salt cod -- salad, fish cakes and anchovy pasta. These days, the menu for his big family dinner skews more to meat and less to the sea, Alfiero added.
Heritage aside, seafood keeps growing in popularity and around the winter holidays, demand reaches a fever pitch.
"For Christmas, it is high volume on everything -- there isn't anything we are not selling a lot of," Alfiero said.

Oyster hatchery gains town approval

Full text: HARPSWELL -- Harpswell will be home to one of the state's few commercial oyster hatcheries after selectmen approved a lease with Running Tide Technologies Inc., a South Portland company looking to open a hatchery at Mitchell Field early next year.
The town has been meeting with the company since late September to hammer out a lease for a 1.33-acre parcel of the town's marine business district at the site of the former Navy fuel depot. The property includes a garage and a concrete slab that Running Tide Technologies Inc. hopes to transform into a hatchery. According to the company's owner, Marty Odelin, Mitchell Field is an ideal location for the operation.
"The reason why we like Mitchell Field is it's super-quiet (and has) nice clean water, and for hatching oysters, you want it to be quiet and you want really clean water," Odelin said. "Everything we do is going to be trying to maximize how quiet and clean it is."
While oyster farming has been a growing industry over the past few years, the state has only two commercial hatcheries, according to the Department of Marine Resources. One is in Walpole-Damariscotta and the other in Bremen. Oyster farmers rely on the hatcheries for seed, which they then grow over multiple years until the oysters reach market size.
Running Tide Technologies Inc. has four aquaculture leases, all in Harpswell.
"We're essentially a shellfish farming company, and it might be more accurate to call us a 'picks and shovels' company of shellfish farming. Our plan is to build equipment and to provide seed etc., and have our own farms and supply to other people as well," Odelin said.
According to the lease agreed on last week, Running Tides Technology Inc. will pay just over $6,000 per year in rent to the town for the property, starting at $6,107 in the first year, with incremental increases until the rent reaches $6,874 in the fifth year.
As part of its lease, the company will renovate the building, which needs repairs after years of underuse.
Odelin said the company would spend around $180,000 to renovate the garage into a "state-of-the-art" facility. Their total budget, which includes installing equipment, repaving a concrete slab and running the intake pipe, comes out to around $500,000, he said.
The company will run an intake pipe from the ocean north of the jetty into the facility to provide water for the hatchery. Water will be treated before being discharged back into the ocean. The company also plans to set up a kelp farm at the end of the intake pipe to help clean the water, reducing turbidity and acidity in the water while adding oxygen.
"The water out here is fantastic. It's as good as it gets," Odelin said. "It's exactly in the right target range for salinity, and it's very consistent."
The company plans to complete renovations and begin operations by March 1, though it already has one eye on expansion.
As part of the lease, the company has the option of expanding to an adjacent 3.85-acre parcel to the east. Odelin said if the company exercised that option, it would be looking to build greenhouses to grow feed for the seed and possibly grow more oysters in that area. There is a public access road in that parcel, and if the company expands into that area, it will relocate the road at its own expense.
The company also has floated ideas about kayak and outdoor equipment rentals, as well as oyster cookouts and a tasting area on site.
"We hope to be a good tenant and neighbor of Mitchell Field," Odelin said. "Our goal for Mitchell Field is just to have the hatchery and then potentially long-term to be growing some feed in a greenhouse."
In their closing comments, the selectmen noted their appreciation for the size of the project.
"Over the years, we've had a number of opportunities come before us -- some quite large; some, controversial. This one is small with a potential to grow very nicely," Selectman David I. Chipman said. "It fits so nicely in there. I'm very happy to support it."

Full text: Forty years ago Belfast was probably best known for poultry processing. Rendered chicken fat slicked the water in the harbor, and feathers flying in the wind were jokingly called "snowstorms in July."
The industry collapsed in the 1980s, and the city has since remade itself as a community that takes environmental sustainability seriously.
So, it's no surprise that Belfast is the preferred site for a Norwegian company looking to build a state-of-the art, land-based aquaculture facility, which requires clean, cold water to raise salmon from eggs to adulthood. And it's also no surprise that the project is under fire by some local activists who say that it's too big and would destroy an unspoiled wooded area.
We have all become familiar with the stories of Maine industries in decline, from plant closings to groundfish catch limits, but few of us can remember when Maine's waterfronts were busy job sites with more workers than tourists. The kind of conflict seen in Belfast is playing out along the Maine coast, as the long-awaited emergence of an aquaculture sector starts to take shape, and unfamiliar uses are starting to show up in places that had grown quiet.
Opponents of Nordic Aquafarms, the salmon farm developer, have filed a lawsuit against the city for approving a zoning change, hoping to kill the project by delaying it. In Brunswick and Kittery, neighbors are voicing their opposition to oyster farms that are seeking approval to expand. The outcome of these fights could determine whether this industry will be able to take root and thrive.
At this point, we're rooting for the industry. Nobody wants to see a return to lightly regulated polluters like the chicken processors of the past, but for the sake of the people who need good jobs, the state has a responsibility to be known for something beside nice views.
According to the United Nations, the global supply of fish would need to double over the next three decades to feed the world. Meanwhile, many wild fisheries are in decline. Right now, Maine's seafood industry is overly dependent on lobstering. It's not fully known how the fishery will be affected by climate change, but it's an established fact that lobsters are migrating to colder waters and once-healthy fisheries to our south have collapsed.
Expanding aquaculture is projected to supply two-thirds of the world's seafood, and it is considered both a way to protect the food supply from climate change and a way to contribute to a lower carbon profile than other food production methods do.
Maine's coastline, the presence of world-class research institutions and proximity to the East Coast markets put the state in an enviable position. Allowing the growth of aquaculture here can add to Maine's exports, bringing jobs and money into communities that have been left behind by the collapse of traditional industries.
Farm-raised salmon, oysters and seaweed all provide ways for people to make a living in a sustainable way, and they present other opportunities, such as recycling waste into products like nutrient-rich fertilizers or the biodegradable shopping bags made from discarded lobster shells, recently developed by researchers in Canada.
All Mainers should demand that our environmental standards are as tough as they need to be and that they are enforced consistently. But we should also be open to new uses of our shared resources that can take the place of the industries we've lost.

Use carbon tax to save planet... [Derived headline]

Full text: Use carbon tax to save planet
The Morning Sentinel and Kennebec Journal deserve special praise for giving front-page coverage to the latest report on climate change, part of the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a government report produced every four years ("Changing climate to put further pressure on New England, federal report predicts," Nov. 24). It details the significant impacts already being observed here in Maine.
The Climate Assessment gives information about warming temperatures, increased precipitation and bigger storms; the likelihood of serious contamination by flooding; the fishing industry's gloomy forecast; and acidification of ocean waters predicting the demise of the shellfish industry, etc.
Northeastern states have already seen the greatest changes, and more are predicted. As Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, noted, "Steps must be taken to reduce climate warming emissions."
U.S. Sen. Angus King's comments go further and are worth repeating: "As today's report makes abundantly clear, we are grossly failing ourselves and our children in the face of an increasingly dangerous threat. It's time to listen to the scientists who have for decades warned of the serious consequences of climate change for our economy, our ecosystems and our national defense. Generations of future Americans will judge us harshly for anything less than a full response to this crisis -- not a denial, not excuses, not equivocation. We need to act. We need to act now."
So what action should be taken? The answer is to put a price on the very thing that is causing climate change, namely emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels -- coal, oil and natural gas -- something we rely on for almost everything we do.
This week, a bipartisan bill, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, was introduced in Congress. It would do just that. It proposes to put an economywide price on all fossil fuels at their source, the coal mine or oil well or gas well. The price would start at $15 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions (which would add about 15 cents on a gallon of gasoline) and increase annually at $10 per year. Call it a "pollution tax" if you will.
However, instead of adding to government coffers, all revenue would be returned to the economy as an equal dividend to all adults, with half dividends for children (up to two per household). Your first dividend check would come prior to the first tax being imposed. Call the monthly dividend a "climate security check" if you like.
Pricing carbon fuels will incentivize industry and commerce to innovate in how they manufacture goods and get them to market. Alternative energy sources will become cheaper over time as the price of fossil fuels increases. Free market competition will determine which products get to market cheaper.
Yes, some items will become more expensive, but the dividend will allow us to choose alternatives ourselves, as well as rethinking energy efficiency throughout our lives. You too are part of the free market.
Milton Friedman had similar thoughts about reducing pollution. His notion was to "impose a tax on the amount of pollutants emitted by a car, thus making it in the self-interest of car manufacturers and consumers to keep down pollution."
Friedman was a champion of small government, the kind that holds people accountable when something they're doing negatively affects others not involved. If there is no such accountability, polluters hide the true costs of their products or actions by dumping -- yes, literally dumping -- waste into the environment, via smokestacks and vehicle exhausts, polluting the air we breathe.
More recently, Yale Professor William Nordhaus won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his detailed analyses showing that a carbon tax is by far the most effective way to lower carbon emissions. It is more efficient than using government controls such as regulating emission standards for vehicles and power plants. For comparison, raising the price of tobacco reduced smoking.
So how far does this get us in cutting carbon emissions and slowing climate change? The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report spelled out the urgency of keeping global temperature increase to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius. It called for reducing emissions 50 percent by 2030. The new bill before Congress comes very close. So, Congress, get it done!

Gift guide shares joy of Maine activities

Full text: Experience gifts grow in popularity
Tim Johnson's pitch for his ax-throwing class is simple and direct.
"Ever felt the urge to chuck an ax across the room?" he asks on the web page for his business, Maine Warrior Gym in Westbrook. "Now you can!"
Johnson's main business is ninja-style training classes for kids. The ax-throwing is a sideline.
But it's become an unexpectedly popular sideline. Gift certificates for Johnson's ax-throwing -- $35 for an introductory session, with a choice of axes and tomahawks -- are a popular gift choice, he said, for the holidays or life events.
"We've had bachelorette parties and we've had divorce parties," all centered on ax-throwing, he said.
It's also an example of a growing trend of experiential gift-giving. Instead of another sweater, proponents said, why not give a loved one a thoughtful gift that will create a memory?
"It's something we push a lot," Johnson said. "Experiences are more fulfilling and don't take up as much space in the closet."
Maddy Purcell pushes experiential gifts as well. Her business -- Fyood (pronounced "feud") Kitchen -- sells an experience similar to the "Chopped" TV show, with participants striving to create a tasty dish from a set of ingredients, even if they're not familiar with those foods. But she also believes giving experiences as a gift is a fast-growing trend.
That led her to put together a small gift guide, the Experience Maine Gift Guide, with links to other businesses that sell experiences, such as Johnson's ax-throwing classes and oyster farm tasting tours and disc golf passes.
Research from the Wharton School of Economics backs Purcell up. Scholars found that not only is spending on experiential gifts growing faster than spending on traditional gifts, but both the giver and recipient are happier with those choices.
"There's this double gift involved," Purcell said.
Wharton professor Cassie Mogilner, whose research was published in a paper co-authored with Cindy Chan, a professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto Scarborough, said it's clear that people are much happier, and that happiness is lasting, when people treat themselves to a nice dinner or going on vacation or going to a concert, rather than buying the latest electronic gadget or a piece of jewelry.
"We ran a bunch of studies and found that when recipients receive an experience, regardless of whether they share in that experience with the gift-giver, they feel more connected to the gift-giver as a result of it, compared to receiving a material gift," said Mogilner in an interview posted on Wharton's website.

Acadia Mountain Guides Climbing School in Bar Harbor is one of the companies participating in the Maine experiential gift guide. It offers gift certificates for things such as a daylong hike up Mount Washington for $150 and a two-day trek up Mount Katahdin for $225 to weeklong hut-to-hut cross-country skiing trips that start at about $1,150.
Amanda Hatley, the company's retail manager, said other popular choices include avalanche rescue training programs, which are often given as gifts from family members who want to make sure loved ones know what to do in the backcountry.
"It's great to know this information, especially if you're on Mount Katahdin or Tuckerman Ravine in the winter," Hatley said.
She said grandparents often spring for a summer camp gift certificate for their grandkids.
"We have a lot of gift-giving that goes on over here," Hatley said.
Purcell said the outdoor adventures are emblematic of the experiential gift-giving trend. Millennials, she said, are particularly attentive to their effect on the world, and that includes what they do around the holidays.
"There's an emphasis on conscientious consumerism," she said. "People are spending more on events and experiences than on other things."
A survey by the National Retail Federation last February of more than 7,000 respondents found that 42 percent of consumers would prefer an experiential Valentine's Day gift, rather than a material gift. People ages 25 to 34 were much more likely to give an experiential gift, the survey found.
That is also borne out by Mogilner's research.
"There's a lot of talk right now about how (millennials) share these life narratives that they're telling through their experiences, and they're posting these really cool experiences on Facebook," she said. "So there's more awareness of the value of experiences, and maybe gift-givers might be a little more likely to give experiences."
Social media also play a role that could benefit the businesses. Purcell said most of the people who take part in Fyood post photos and videos of the event online, spreading word of her business via valuable word-of-mouth publicity, she said.
An experience gift also can be a gentle nudge, said Stephanie Harmon, the owner of Hustle and Flow, a dance and exercise studio in Portland.
The certificates for Hustle and Flow classes, she said, are usually bought "by people who have been talking about it with a friend or partner and have been talking about it for a while."
Buying a certificate for a friend is a way to ensure that the giver and the recipient finally will take a fitness class, she said.
Gift certificates are good for her company's financial health, Harmon added, with a boost in revenue at the end of the year and the likelihood that at least some of the recipients will sign up for more than what the certificate covers.
"It's definitely nice around the holidays. There's a little extra boost," she said.

Full text: Mere Point Oyster Co. currently operates on about 1/4 acre in Brunswick's Maquoit Bay, but hopes to expand to 40-acres. But area residents are upset about the plans, largely because of its planned size.
Brunswick preservation group opposes 40-acre expansion
BRUNSWICK — Signs calling to “Stop the oyster factory” line Mere Point Road, dotting dozens of tree trunks and property lines on the roadsides leading all the way to the boat launch. The subject of residents ire: an unassuming business based out of a large red barn known as the Mere Point Oyster Co., now in its third year, which operates on about a quarter-acre on Maquoit Bay.
That small operation might not be so small for much longer. Its owner has submitted a 40-acre lease application. Doug Niven and Dan Deveraux hope their company will grow up to 1.5 million oysters per year by 2021 and have a “maximum stocking density” of 5 million by 2023.
The expansion proposal has angered some in the community, including members of Maquoit Bay Preservation Group — 40 or 50 property owners concerned about the greater implications of the lease. There is not enough information out there, they argue, to determine adequately the ecological effects of an operation this size, which would be the second-largest in Maine.
THE PLAN Niven and Devereaux have applied for a 10-year, 40-acre lease in Maquoit Bay in the area south of Bunganuc Rock and west of the Mere Point peninsula. If approved, this would expand their company’s size by about 160 times, if their quarter-acre estimates are accurate, and would produce more than 16 times the oysters they harvested in 2018.
The lease application was marked as “complete” by the Department of Marine Resources in February and details a 5-acre nursery for up to 2 million seed oysters, a 10-acre intermediate area for oysters in the early to middle stages of growth and 20 acres for the full-grown oysters and for sinking the cages during the winter. An additional 5-acre “experimental” area would be used for scallops and quahogs.
The space seems intimidating, but according to Niven, in the 3,000-acre bay, 40 acres covers only about 1 percent.
Devereaux said the operation would be spread out and wouldn’t cover all of that 40-acre plot. If the company consolidated all its gear into one corner of the leased area, it would take up about 1.5 acres. But with 250,000 oysters in the water right now, and with the goal of building that closer to 5 million, it needs more space. No matter what, it would take years to get to that size, he said.
While opponents of the project have expressed concerns that the operation would dominate the view of the bay, Niven argues that with more space, the visual impact may be a little less. The company plans to add more floating Oystergro bags, which he said are not only easier for the crew to flip than the cages, but also are less noticeable in the water.
The extra space also gives the company some flexibility for better management and sustainability if things need to be changed a little, Devereaux said, adding that calling it a factory is just a “scare tactic.”
The lease application also includes their current 10-by-12-foot barge and battery-powered oyster tumbler as well as one 20-by-20 barge with a shed and two 12-by-20 work floats for cleaning, sorting and repairing gear.
The business is family-run, with both Niven and Devereaux’s children helping out, and would add only a few part-time employees to help on the water but also would require the addition of a bookkeeper and possibly a contract scientist. They hope to recruit college and high school students to help with operations in the summer too, and to “keep the employment in Brunswick.”
“We are firm believers that this is the way to go,” Niven said of the expansion.
THE OPPOSITION Not everyone feels the same way. The Maquoit Bay Preservation Group was formed by a group of concerned citizens such as Mark Wyman and Paul Dioli who say they support aquaculture but are concerned Devereaux and Niven are biting off more than they can chew — and more than the bay can handle.
Early on, Dioli, Wyman and other residents received a letter from Niven and Deveraux, who is also the town harbormaster, introducing themselves and their small business, inviting them over for open house “office hours” and oyster tastings.
It all “seemed harmonious” and neighborly, Dioli said, until another neighbor found the 40-acre lease application. Until that point, they were under the impression that Devereaux and Niven were just continuing with their current aquaculture sites, which Dioli and Wyman say they fully supported. There was a blatant lack of transparency and the owners were “covert” about their plans, Dioli argued.
Niven and Devereaux claim the exact opposite — they were not hiding anything. The application had been online for months and they were willing to speak with anyone who had questions about their plans. In fact, according to Niven, he had tried to contact some of his neighbors to talk about their concerns, but they would not speak with him.
It’s is not just the lack of transparency that Dioli, Wyman and the others are upset about. The farm would be located in the middle of the deepest part of the bay, which is traversed by fishermen, kayakers and other boaters.
“This size and density has never been seen in Maine,” Dioli said, adding that he thinks this goes beyond a “not in my backyard” issue and could be dangerous for the health of the bay.
Concerned, Wyman wanted to become an intervener in the process and was directed to the harbormaster — Dan Devereaux. This, the group argues, is a conflict of interest, despite the fact that Devereaux recused himself from any comment on the application process. City officials have weighed in and determined there was not a conflict of interest, Devereaux said, but he understands how there could be “the appearance of one.” Wyman is not convinced that Devereaux should be responsible for monitoring his own operation.
Niven said he thought people were afraid of the unknown and, according to Dioli, that is exactly what they are afraid of.
“We need to study it,” he said. “Eelgrass is coming back. We support aquaculture, but this doesn’t fit. … Processing the oysters in the water is not best practice and adds unknown amounts of sediment to the water.”
When the boat launch was being proposed, he said, there was study after study and an application that was several inches thick.
“Whether you agreed with it or not, they were clear,” Dioli said. “This needs more investigation.”
Moving immediately for a 40-acre, 10-year lease was irresponsible, according to Dioli, who suggested they first could have applied for an experimental lease. This, according to the Department of Marine Resources, is “small in size (up to 4 acres) and short in duration (up to 3 years). … Experimental leases were created to allow for commercial and scientific research on sites before a longer or larger lease is needed.”
That move would have been met with plenty of “atta boys” and support, Dioli said. Instead, they opted for a decadelong lease that could “bring in $4 million per year and could easily be sold to a large corporation.”
“This doesn’t feel good,” he said.
The group is represented by Crystal Canney, of the Knight Canney Group, who has also served as a spokeswoman for politicians including Angus King, John Baldacci and Eliot Cutler.
“I only take work I believe in,” she said, “I care about the state of Maine.”
WHAT IS OYSTER FARMING? Devereaux and Niven have worked on 26 aquaculture sites in Maquoit Bay, taking up about a quarter-acre. They get their oyster “seedlings,” which are about the size of a pen tip, from Mook Seafood’s hatchery in Walpole. They can put up to 10,000 of those tiny seeds on a mesh screen, similar to a window screen, in the water and move them to bigger screens and bags with larger holes as the seedlings grow. Within a few weeks, the oyster seeds grow to about the size of a pencil eraser, but it takes about two years for an oyster to grow to market size. Throughout the growing process, the oysters are tumbled around in a drum to break off some of the sharp edges.
Once the oysters are ready for sale, they are tumbled again and washed on site. They are then taken to shore, where they’re stored in a walk-in cooler on Niven’s property until sale. Mere Point Oysters are popular at the Crystal Springs Farmers Market and in several local restaurants.
This year the company harvested about 60,000 oysters, Devereaux said, but next year it should have a much larger crop when the 250,000 oysters they started in 2017 are ready. According to their website, only about 40 percent of the oysters they grow are high enough in quality to be considered “Mere Point Oysters.”
Aquaculture, including oyster farming, has been heralded by advocates for its sustainability compared to other animal protein sources, such as cows and pigs. The average oyster will filter up to 50 gallons of water per day, decreasing turbidity and making the water cleaner, Niven said. Plus, according to Devereaux, harvesting 25,000 oysters is about the same as removing one household’s average annual nitrogen output.
“Oysters are restorative,” Niven said, adding that having lived there and watched how the bay has transformed over the years, “we have a unique and distinct interest in these waters.”
THE HEARING The Department of Marine Resources has scheduled a public hearing for 6 p.m. Thursday at Coffin Elementary School, 20 Barrows St., Brunswick. If the hearing “cannot be concluded by a reasonable hour” it will be continued Nov. 19 at the Crooker Theatre, Brunswick High School, 116 Maquoit Bay Road.
The DMR will evaluate the lease based on factors such as ingress and egress; interference with navigation, fishing and other uses; noise; and visual effects among others, although according to Dioli, their scope is too narrow. Each person wishing to speak must submit their comments in writing by 5 p.m. Wednesday.
DMR won’t make a final decision at the hearing.

Whale defenders aim at aquaculture

Full text: Animal rights groups ask regulators to reduce threat of entanglement
Right whale defenders are now taking aim at aquaculture as they try to protect the highly endangered species from deadly fishing gear entanglements.
Advocates usually focus on the lobster industry, which is estimated to account for a million surface-to-seabed trap lines in East Coast waters, when talking about entanglement risks faced by the North Atlantic right whale, whose number has dwindled to fewer than 450. But animal rights groups asking for federal intervention to avoid extinction of the whales now are asking regulators to reduce the threat of aquaculture entanglement, too.
Researchers from Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a U.K.-based nonprofit that advocates for marine animals, want regulators to reduce surface-to-seabed lines in all Gulf of Maine fisheries, not just lobstering. They name aquaculture and gill net as rope-based fishing methods that are known to entrap, injure and kill both humpback and right whales. They say it's not fair for regulators, who are meeting next week, to seek rope reduction from lobstermen while issuing permits for other fisheries that use similar rope.
The proposal does not say how to implement this aquaculture reduction, or whether it should apply to in-shore, near-shore or offshore operations. Maine has a small but rapidly growing aquaculture industry, accounting for about a quarter of Maine's documented $6.5 million-a-year shellfish harvest; but consultants believe the value of Maine's farmed oysters, mussels and scallops will more than quadruple in value over 15 years.
A market analysis prepared for the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in 2016 predicts Maine's shellfish aquaculture industry will grow to $30 million by 2030. It has been cited in multiple economic development reports as having enormous potential for significant growth.
Leaders of Maine's aquaculture industry say they aren't aware of any interactions in Maine waters between aquaculture rope and right whales. Chris Davis, of the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center in Walpole, says Maine aquaculture is conducted almost exclusively in inshore waters, and thus is not likely to overlap with right whale habitat.
The Humane Society of the United States, Defenders of Wildlife and Center for Biological Diversity -- which filed suit against the federal government in January for failing to protect whales from fishing gear -- want to ban aquaculture operations year-round in any area that would be closed seasonally to protect whales, such as Cape Cod Bay, where right whales show up in large numbers to feed from February through mid-May.
These proposals are two of six submitted to the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team, a group that helps write the federal government's plan to reduce the number of whale injuries and deaths, especially those caused by entanglement. The team will meet next week in Providence, Rhode Island, to review the proposals as it considers what changes it will make, if any, to its whale plan in response to the recent lawsuit.
The proposals under consideration also include several that would upend drastically the Maine lobster industry, which last year was credited with contributing $1.6 billion to Maine's economy. The proposals include seasonal closures in the western Gulf of Maine, a reduction in the number of lobster traps that can be fished and a two-year transition to a completely ropeless lobster fishery. Lobster industry groups say its gear has not contributed to the series of right whale deaths over the last two years that have left the population in such dire straits.

Full text: Discussion of proposed 40-acre lease in Maquoit Bay for farming avoided; preservation group opposes project
BRUNSWICK -- With the debate over a large-scale proposed oyster farm looming in the background, aquaculture experts pitched the benefits of oyster farming to Brunswick residents during a forum Thursday.
Though the event didn't address any specific aquaculture farms, the specter of an application for a 40-acre lease in Maquoit Bay off Mere Point loomed over the evening's presentations.
Mere Point Oyster Co., which proposed the operation, has downplayed concerns about the size of the farm.
Members of the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group, mostly residents of Mere Point who oppose the development, have been unswayed. Before Thursday's presentation, the group was handing out flyers calling the proposal a "floating factory."
But the presenters ignored dispute between the group and the company Thursday, opting instead to discuss the benefits of aquaculture in Maine generally.
"Aquaculture is a business. They're trying to make a profit," said Meridith White, director of research and development at Mook Sea Farm. "But they're also producing a sustainable protein source. Shellfish aquaculture is probably the most sustainable animal protein source available."
White went on to praise the oyster's natural ability to remove phytoplankton and nitrogen from the ocean.
"The oyster filtering phytoplankton out of the water is one of their greatest ecosystem services," she said. "One oyster can filter 50 gallons of water a day."
Chris Vonderweidt, of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, said that beyond positive environmental effects, oysters could be an economic boon for Maine. With lobster landings expected to decline in the coming years and groundfish landings already far lower than in the past, oyster aquaculture offers potential for growth. On top of that, there is a massive demand for Maine oysters, according to a market analysis the institute had done.
"The Maine oyster is the gold standard oyster in the U.S. marketplace," said Vonderweidt. "It's the most expensive. It's considered the highest quality by chefs and restaurateurs. It's considered to be premium."
It's unclear whether the experts' views on oyster aquaculture will hold sway with opponents in the Maquoit Bay debate. According to the flyers distributed Thursday, the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group opposes any aquaculture project larger than 2 acres and calls for all processing to be done on land zoned for commercial business. At the moment, there seems to be little middle ground between the owners' desire for a larger, more condensed operation on the bay and the opposition of residents.
The likely clash between the two sides had been scheduled for an Oct. 18 public hearing held by the Department of Marine Resources. Following public opposition, however, the department has canceled that hearing and is rescheduling it for a location with a larger seating area. The department has not posted a new date for the public hearing.

Full text: Energy Pathway for Maine advocates for clean-energy technologies in advance of November elections
A diverse group of 20 organizations on Wednesday released a set of guiding principles it says Maine should follow to take advantage of expanding clean-energy technologies, while protecting the environment and strengthening the economy.
The six principles are contained in a document called Energy Pathway for Maine. Advocates include businesses and interest groups such as Coastal Enterprises Inc., Reed & Reed, East Brown Cow Management, the Island Institute, the Maine Council of Churches and the Shellfish Growers Climate Coalition.
The group say it's important to have a public dialogue about these ideas, as Mainers prepare to elect a new governor and Legislature.
"Maine businesses are ready to invest in clean energy, and we are ready to invest in them," said Elizabeth Rogers, chief communications officer for Coastal Enterprises.
The six principles are:
[bullet] Maine must act to benefit from significant energy transitions underway around the world.
[bullet] Maine's economy is tied to its environment, a connection that is part of our history and the opportunities ahead.
[bullet] Climate change is causing Maine people to experience significant disruptions in their daily lives and bottom line. They want practical ways to do their part to ensure a safe climate for Maine people today and in the future.
[bullet] Innovation and competitive markets offer the fundamental solutions to our energy challenges and take advantage of Maine's entrepreneurial and resourceful spirit.
[bullet] Maine needs a long-term energy plan that benefits all Mainers, rural and urban, and across income levels.
[bullet] Mainers are concerned about the cost of energy. Reducing energy costs is one of many important objectives for greater prosperity and quality of life in Maine.
But the group says Maine is challenged to achieve these goals.
Maine isn't keeping pace with the rapidly expanding market for clean energy, the group says, while many states have started to make a major energy transition. That's leading to lost job opportunities for young people and contributing to the state's aging population. At the same time, it says, Maine exports $5 billion per year from the state economy to buy oil and gas, while abundant local energy resources such as solar, wind, wood and water aren't used to their full potential.
"Maine has hundreds of renewable energy jobs today -- from installers and operators to construction contractors, environmental specialists, and other professionals," said Jeremy Payne, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association. "Growth in this sector will strengthen Maine's ability to attract and retain productive workers."
The Energy Pathway for Maine document will be mailed to all legislative and gubernatorial candidates, as well as other stakeholders.
A companion website, www.EnergyPathwayMaine.com, has been set up for additional businesses and organizations to sign on as supporters.

Full text: Owners defend presence of new 40-acre project on Maquoit Bay, saying there won't be much visual, noise impact
BRUNSWICK -- Just three years after launching The Mere Point Oyster Company in Brunswick, owners Doug Niven and Dan Devereaux are looking to launch the state's second largest oyster farm, a 40-acre endeavor on Maquoit Bay.
For the owners, the expansion is the natural next step in their business's growth and part of an effort to consolidate several existing smaller leases in the area. But some neighbors fear the development will turn the bay into an industrial area.
"What is striking ... is the scale -- the magnitude -- of what's going on," said Paul Dioli, a member of the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group. "This is a factory going up on the water."
Mere Point has had smaller leases to harvest oysters on the bay for years, so when the company filed an application for another lease, many residents didn't really take notice, assuming the project would be similar to the farms that were already in place. It took a while before someone noticed the size of the proposal -- a 40-acre farm that could eventually produce 5 million oysters annually.
Paul Dioli and his wife, Kathie, were shocked when they learned what the proposal entailed. The couple have lived on the waterfront for nine years now, and they're used to the regular activity and noise of Maine's working waterfront, including aquaculture farms.
"We see lobster boats all the time, and we're huge proponents of aquaculture," she said.
"There's several great farms that have been in operation on that bay for years that have coexisted very nicely with the bay, with the neighborhood," added Paul Dioli. "It's never been an issue."
Still, they fear what this significantly larger operation could bring about.
"It's one thing to have a farm, but it's another thing to have an entire industry out on the water," said Kathie Dioli.
Niven and Devereaux say the idea that they're putting together a massive, industrial-scale project doesn't hold water. According to Devereaux, the 40-acre figure attached to the project can mislead casual observers as to the relative size of the farm.
"When people look out on the water, they don't necessarily interpret the amount of acreage that is there because you can see clearly," he said. "It's hard to get a perspective. ... We're asking for a relatively small portion of the bay."
The bay covers about 3,000 acres, said Devereaux, meaning their farm would span just over 1 percent of the area if maxed out. The Department of Marine Resources places the limit for aquaculture farms at 100 acres -- more than twice the area of the current proposal.
According to Maine Aquaculture Program Director Jon Lewis, the proposed farm would be large, but not unprecedented.
"Generally, our oyster farms around the state are 5-10 acres," said Lewis. "This would be a large one."
If it reaches the full 40-acres called for in the application, the farm would be second only to a 50-acre oyster farm in Trenton.
The company currently has 26 aquaculture leases in the area. If the department allows them to move forward with their proposal, those 26 leases will be consolidated and brought into the 40-acre area.
Residents have taken issue with several aspects of the project. Members of the Maquoit Bay Preservation Group showed up at last week's Brunswick Town Council to voice concerns with the proposal, notably the impact the project would have on the environment and on activity in the bay. Noise produced by an oyster tumbler -- a machine used to sort the oysters -- was also a concern, with Paul Dioli comparing it to having a cement mixer on the water.
According to a state site plan review, the farm is unlikely to impact most traffic around the bay, as larger vessels will stick to the deep channels on either side of the farm. Smaller boats, especially those traversing east to west across the bay, might have to alter their routes around the site. Brunswick Police Cmdr. Thomas Garrepy and Marine Patrol Officer Curtis LaBelle both said they believed the project would not hinder mariners.
The site review also indicated minimal if any impact on lobstermen, shellfish harvesters and bait fishermen.
The owners believe their farm will improve the water quality in the bay. Key to that claim is the fact that a single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water in a single day. Whereas most Mainers are concerned about what commercial activity is putting into the water, Niven and Devereaux are touting what their oysters are taking out of the water.
"It cleans the water. The water is less turbid, and you have more light penetration down to the eelgrass," explained Devereaux. "Our oysters are helping the bay. They're helping the vegetation of the bay. They're creating habitat."
As far as concerns over noise, Niven said that he built the oyster tumbler, and currently uses it out on the water at the company's several active leases. He said the noise produced doesn't even approach that of an idling lobster boat. The tumbler is powered by an electric, solar powered engine, further reducing noise.
Kathie Dioli says she felt blindsided by the scope of the project when she learned about it, and believes the owners should have been more proactive in reaching out to residents.
While the application process includes opportunities for public involvement, including a scoping session which was held on Sept. 11, many residents weren't yet aware of the scale. Some residents assumed that the lease would be for an aquaculture farm similarly sized to the ones existing in the bay.
"We had to start investigating on our own to find out what are these things? How do they develop? What happens with them?" she explained. "There was literally a complete lack of transparency by the principals."
On the other hand, the owners say they don't know what else they could have done to be more transparent. Documents for the project have been online for months, including a site plan that addresses some use and environmental concerns. The public scoping session, was advertised in the newspaper, but Devereaux and Niven said no one else showed up.
In addition to the public process, the two claim to have sent letters to all their Mere Point neighbors in July to let them know about the application. They've also opened up their facilities in the past to explain their business and the coming changes. "We were never hiding it," said Niven.
"These people just weren't paying attention," added Devereaux.
Devereaux serves as the harbormaster for Brunswick and is also listed as the town's marine warden. For the Diolis and others who spoke at Monday's Brunswick Town Council meeting, Devereaux's involvement with the project is an issue.
"Dan is an officer in the town, and people were really worried about voicing their opinions and having retaliation," said Kathie Dioli. "How's the town going to react when one of the principal owners works for the town?"
She did not elaborate on what type of retaliation she or her neighbors were concerned about, and Devereaux dismissed the idea that he would retaliate.
While Devereaux acknowledged that the situation could have the appearance of a conflict of interest, he has recused himself from any decisions related to the application process. And at last Monday's Brunswick Town Council meeting, Town Manager John Eldridge dismissed concerns over Devereaux's involvement, noting that the aquaculture application was overseen by the state, not the town.
For Niven and Devereaux, much of the concern with their project stems from misunderstandings about their application and company, as well as a lack of knowledge among the community about aquaculture in general. The owners invited to members of the Maquoit Preservation Group and any other concerned neighbors to come to an information session from 5-7 p.m. Thursday at Curtis Memorial Library.
Meridith White, director of research and development at Mook Sea Farm and other aquaculture experts will be holding a forum to address some common misconceptions about what aquaculture entails. Those who can't attend can watch online.
In addition, there will be a public hearing on the project at 6 p.m., Oct. 18 at Brunswick Town Hall. Written comments will be accepted until 5 p.m. the day before.

Full text: Officials investigate large clam die-off
REVERE, Mass. ï¿½ Massachusetts environmental officials are investigating a large clam die-off.
The Boston Globe reported hundreds of thousands of Atlantic surf clams have washed up on Revere Beach this week. The state Department of Conservation and Recreation says the die-off is the third event of its kind this summer.
The Division of Marine Fisheries will analyze the clams in an attempt to determine the cause of the mass shellfish kill.
Save the Harbor/Save the Bay spokesman Bruce Berman believes shellfish die-off have increased as a result of climate change. Berman said a certain type of algae that clogs the gills of clams could also be responsible for the kills.
Thousands of menhaden washed up in Mystic River in July. Multiple dead whales have also drifted onto New England shores this month.
4 Conn. residents get West Nile virus
HARTFORD, Conn. ï¿½ Connecticut health officials said four more state residents have tested positive for West Nile virus, raising the total number of human cases this year to 10.
Officials said Thursday that the four people included two residents of Bridgeport, one from Durham and one from Southington. They ranged in age from 50 to over 70, and three needed to go to hospitals. All are recovering. They became ill within the past month.
Three state residents tested positive for the virus in all of 2017.
The virus is spread by infected mosquitoes and most people donï¿½t develop symptoms, but it can be fatal in rare cases. Officials continue to urge residents to remove standing water from their properties and use insect repellent at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active.
Rare virus detected in mosquito in Mass.
LAKEVILLE, Mass. ï¿½ Massachusetts health officials said a mosquito has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis for the first time this year.
The state Massachusetts Department of Public Health said Wednesday the virus was detected in a mosquito collected Sept. 17 in Lakeville near the Rhode Island state line.
Officials said there have been no human cases of the virus so far this year and none in 2017.
State Epidemiologist Catherine Brown said drought conditions in 2015 and 2016 reduced the population of mosquitoes responsible for spreading the virus.
The department said the virus is rare in humans but can be potentially fatal.
It advises residents wear insect repellent when outdoors and take other steps to prevent mosquito bites, like avoiding peak times for mosquito activity, which are from dusk to dawn.
Teen killed in gas explosions laid to rest
LAWRENCE, Mass. ï¿½ Hundreds of mourners have come out to remember the Massachusetts teen killed in last weekï¿½s natural gas explosions north of Boston.
The Eagle-Tribune reported some 300 people attended Wednesdayï¿½s funeral for 18-year-old Leonel Rondon at St. Mary the Assumption Church in Lawrence.
Rev. John Dello Russo remembered Rondon as a teen with a bright future. Rondonï¿½s cousin Leomary Colon said heï¿½d once told her to ï¿½live it until itï¿½s gone.ï¿½
The high school junior died September 13 after the chimney of an exploding house crashed into his car and crushed him. Rondon had just received his driverï¿½s license hours earlier.
About 25 other people were injured in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover. Dozens of homes were damaged or destroyed and thousands were forced to evacuate. Many are now filing damage claims.
Mice populations are booming in Vermont
BURLINGTON, Vt. ï¿½ Exterminators around Vermont say business is much busier this year amid a suspected boom in the local mouse population.
The Vermont Department of Health does not keep track of the mouse population but said the rise in sightings makes sense. WCAX-TV reported state biologists said there was an uptick in seed production last year that most likely led to a boom in the mouse population around the state.
Biologist Scott Darling said seed production is down this year, so itï¿½s likely the mouse population will fall next year.
Property owner kills 3 cubs going after honey
TAMWORTH, N.H. ï¿½ New Hampshire authorities said three bear cubs have been shot and killed after they and their mother got into a beehive in Tamworth.
Fish and Game officials said a man who had been having problems with the bears going after his chickens and beehives for several days killed the cubs on Wednesday.
State law allows someone to kill wild animals on their property that are damaging crops, poultry or domestic animals. But the state also helps property owners with fencing and other measures to prevent that.
Colonial-era book returned to archives
PROVIDENCE, R.I. ï¿½ A Colonial-era document that went missing three decades ago is back in possession of the Rhode Island state archives.
The recovered document is whatï¿½s called a ï¿½minute book,ï¿½ handwritten by a court clerk from 1746 through 1749.
Andrew Smith, assistant administrator at the archives, told WPRI-TV it is an official court record, including information on judges, defendants, plaintiffs and juries.
The book went missing in 1991 but showed up in an online auction earlier this year.
Subtropical bird spotted in Connecticut
STRATFORD, Conn. ï¿½ Connecticut bird watchers say they were delighted to see a pink bird more often found in subtropical areas flying around their state recently.
The roseate spoonbill is usually found in South American marshes, Central America, and the southern U.S., but have been spotted in New England this summer.
Hearst Media Connecticut reported that Paul Raccuia first spotted the bird in Stratford on Sept. 14.
Compiled from wire reports It was seen again at the Connecticut Audubonï¿½s Milford Point Coastal Center on Wednesday.
One birder said it appears to be the same one seen in Maine earlier this summer.
The Audubon said seeing a roseate spoonbill in Connecticut was unheard of before this summer.
A society spokesman said it may stay in Connecticut for a few weeks if it can find enough food.
Police dive team practicing drill locates actual human body
WARWICK, R.I. ï¿½ A police dive team in Rhode Island conducting a routine body recovery drill has come across an actual human body.
The Providence Journal reported the Warwick Police Department dive team had been practicing search and recovery skills on the Pawtuxet River Wednesday.
Team members were searching for a mannequin that had been hidden in the river when they found the body of a man in his 40s instead.
Warwick Police Chief Stephen McCartney told the Journal police have tentatively identified the man, but arenï¿½t releasing more details until his family is notified.
Police: FedEx worker diverted packages to momï¿½s house
HARTFORD, Conn. ï¿½ Police in Connecticut say a FedEx worker diverted $2,800 worth of shipped items, including two assault-style rifles, to his motherï¿½s home.
The Journal Inquirer reported that 31-year-old Marlon Hamilton is facing 46 charges, including identity theft, forgery and stealing a firearm.
Police say Hamilton printed fake shipping labels and attached them to the packages he wanted from the Willington facility.
Authorities said he had guns, electronics and music equipment shipped to his motherï¿½s Hartford home. Hamiltonï¿½s mother had no knowledge of the scheme.
Police were tipped off when a sporting goods company reported it had never received two rifles it had ordered.
Hamilton blamed a co-worker, but police said that co-worker doesnï¿½t exist.
The guns havenï¿½t been located.
Hamilton was held on $400,000 bond. No defense lawyer was listed in judicial records.
Man charged in stabbing after fatal pedestrian accident
WALTHAM, Mass. ï¿½ A Massachusetts man is facing attempted murder charges after authorities say he stabbed a tow truck driver who struck and killed his mother.
The Middlesex district attorneyï¿½s office said 38-year-old Philip Horner faces arraignment Thursday in Waltham District Court.
Police said 68-year-old Benita Horner, of Belmont, was struck as she crossed a Watertown street late Wednesday morning. She was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police said Philip Horner stabbed the 60-year-old driver multiple times in the torso. The unnamed driver remained in the hospital Thursday.
Authorities did not disclose the relationship between Philip and Benita Horner but witnesses said Philip Horner shouted ï¿½You killed my mom!ï¿½ after the accident while the driver said ï¿½I didnï¿½t see her!ï¿½
It could not immediately be determined if Philip Horner had a lawyer.
2 charged with thefts from New Jersey submarine museum
NEWARK, N.J. ï¿½ A man and woman from Connecticut have been charged with stealing items from a World War II-era submarine in New Jersey.
Hackensack police allege Jon Stevens, of West Haven, and Laura Palmese, of Colchester, swam along the Hackensack River and gained access to the USS Ling in mid-August. Theyï¿½re charged with stealing a lantern and a lieutenantï¿½s shoulder lapel and are scheduled to appear in court Oct. 1.
Reached by phone, Stevens declined comment Thursday. A message left at a phone listing for Palmese wasnï¿½t returned.
The submarine is part of the New Jersey Naval Museum.
In August, police said someone opened hatches and deliberately flooded the submarine. That incident is under investigation.
Authorities also are investigating the theft of four plaques valued at approximately $10,000 from the sub.

Full text: James Knott revolutionized industry by creating more durable option than wood
James Knott, an inventor and entrepreneur who revolutionized the lobstering industry by building a better lobster trap, died Thursday at his home in Massachusetts. He was 88.
Knott was founder, owner and retired CEO of Riverdale Mills Corp., the company he formed in 1980 to produce wire mesh lobster traps, which Knott invented.
Riverdale Mills is the maker of "Aquamesh," the first marine-grade coated wire mesh used to replace traditional wood in the construction of lobster traps.
A trained economist and mechanical engineer, Knott had noticed how much time lobstermen spent fixing their wooden traps. He was convinced there had to be a better way.
Knott set out to build a more durable lobster trap to keep fishermen in their boats instead of on shore repairing traps or building new ones. He invented and began manufacturing Aquamesh traps, which lasted far longer and ultimately won over skeptical North Atlantic and Canadian lobstermen. Today, 85 percent of all lobster traps in North America are made with Aquamesh, according to Riverdale Mills.
In 2006, Knott was awarded an honorary doctorate degree by the University of Maine for his "commitment to the future of the lobster industry, innovative spirit, perseverance and positive leadership, willingness to share his knowledge and ideas and his outstanding support of UMaine's Lobster Institute."
"Jim Knott was a well-respected visionary and an ardent supporter of the lobster industry," said Bob Bayer, executive director of the UMaine Lobster Institute, in a statement. "His impact cannot be understated. The technical changes he introduced to lobster fishing in Maine and throughout North America were profoundly significant. He singlehandedly changed and bettered the way of life for so many people."
Knott founded Riverdale Mills in an old abandoned mill on the banks of the Blackstone River in Northbridge, Massachusetts. There, he worked with his sons to restore the facility and property, while beginning mass production of Aquamesh. An integral part of the science leading to Knott's innovative product were his proprietary galvanized after-welding and polyvinyl chloride coating processes.
This year, the company saw its raw price for steel double because of tariffs. In late July, the company had not passed on increased production costs to its customers in Maine. CEO James Knott Jr., son of James Sr., said Riverdale was absorbing the price hit by slowing the rate at which it was retiring construction debt and dipping into energy savings.
"We are who we are because of the lobster industry, so we're doing everything we can to make sure this won't hurt the industry," Knott said in an interview with the Press Herald.
Following the overwhelming success of Aquamesh in the lobster industry, Knott Sr. set out to expand and diversify the Riverdale Mills product line for other industrial, commercial and business applications.
His "WireWall" high security fencing, which is "virtually impossible to climb or cut," according to Riverdale Mills, has been installed worldwide at embassies, transit centers, ports, borders, military bases, manufacturing and power plants, and other highly secure locations. Knott's welded wire mesh is also used extensively by professionals in the horticulture, agriculture, aquaculture, construction and water treatment industries, the company said.
In all, Riverdale Mills now produces about 3,500 different wire mesh products, it said.
In his earlier life, Knott earned an economics degree from Harvard College, studied mechanical engineering at Northeastern University and served two years as a lieutenant in the Army. Before starting his own company, he was CEO of Coatings Engineering Corp., the world's largest custom plastic coater. He was also a longtime director of the Gilbert & Bennett Manufacturing Co. of Georgetown, Connecticut.
According to colleagues, Knott was an early adopter of recycling. To build some of his manufacturing machinery, he repurposed parts from a printing press the previous tenant of the mill had left behind. When asked once by a journalist how his company had thrived when so many other U.S. manufacturers had faltered, Knott responded, "We keep our costs low."
He also modernized the mill with efficiency in mind, restored the natural habitat, tapped the river for hydropower and instituted recycling of all the steel from the manufacturing process.
Knott was an ardent supporter of the lobster industry, funding scholarships and research.
"With the passing of Jim Knott, the lobster and shellfishing industry has lost one of its most prolific supporters," said Beth Casoni, executive director of the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, in a statement. "Jim believed in sustainable fishing and supported our efforts to ensure the viability of the industry and conservation of fish species. On behalf of the entire industry, we acknowledge his contributions, are grateful for his involvement, and will miss him tremendously."
Knott's death was preceded by that of Betty Knott, his wife of 67 years, who died in February. He is survived by his four children, Janet Knott, Andrew Knott, James Knott Jr. and Nancy Knott, and four grandchildren. James Knott Jr. became CEO of Riverdale Mills in 2015.
A celebration of James Knott's life will be held at the Whitin Lasell Manor at 120 Hill Street, Whitinsville, Massachusetts from 2 to 5 p.m. on Sunday, Nov. 18. Condolences may be expressed to the family by visiting carrfuneralhome.com.

Full text: Small businesses in southern Maine are in line for federal grants to help them save energy and grow their companies.
Nearly $530,000 from the Renewable Energy for America Program and Value Added Producer grants will be allocated to six Maine businesses, according to a news release from U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who sits on the committee with oversight of the U.S. Department of Agriculture programs.
Turtle Rock Farm in Brunswick will receive $250,000 under the producer program. The money will be used to expand the marketing, preserving and canning of organic vegetables. The project is expected to increase revenue to the farm, grow the customer base, and increase the wholesale volume of Turtle Rock Farm.
Five businesses won grants through the renewable energy program. They are:
[bullet] T&D Wood Energy of Sanford: $200,000. The company intends to build a midsized wood pellet manufacturing facility, adjacent to an operating white pine sawmill. The project, which will use waste residue from the sawmill, is expected to generate enough electricity to power 15,142 homes.
[bullet] Mook Sea Farms, Walpole: $49,597. The grant will be used to buy and install a solar array for this oyster farm. The project is expected to save the company $14,238 per year in energy costs.
[bullet] Flying Frog of Freeport: $19,496. The commercial property company will use the grant to buy and install a solar array, which will benefit its tenant, Buck's Naked BBQ, by generating about 11 percent of its electricity.
[bullet] Mallory Property Holdings of Newcastle: $6,465. A real estate holding company, Mallory Property intends to use the grant money to buy and install a solar array at Split Rock Distillery, which it owns. The array will help the distillery save about $1,330 a year in energy costs.
[bullet] Porchside Properties of Dresden: $4,228. The company will use the money to install a solar array at Porchside Veterinary Care, saving the facility about $1,000 a year in electricity costs.

British transgender activists frustrated by a lack of online representation are claiming Maine's beloved new lobster emoji as their own.
The group, Lobsters Against Transphobia, launched an online petition last month to push Unicode, a nonprofit consortium that signs off on new pictograms, for a pink-and-blue flag emoji. Until they get their own flag, the group urged supporters to turn to the lobster, one of 157 new emojis that Unicode approved this year, as a substitute.
Lobsters can display both male and female characteristics.
"Emojis are a way for the world to connect and trans people shouldn't be left out of the conversation," the group said. "Unicode granted the lobster emoji proposal, which argued that people suffered 'frustration and confusion' at having to use a shrimp or crab emoji instead of a lobster. Imagine if that was your gender. Surely we deserve the same rights you have afforded crustaceans?"
Trans advocates are jumping on board the online campaign by adding the lobster emoji to their Twitter handles, dressing up as lobsters during Trans Pride parades and decorating colorfully polished fingernails with lobster stickers. On Twitter, they have gathered under the single banner of #ClawsOutForTrans.
As of Sunday, three weeks after it was posted, about 2,450 people had signed the petition hosted on change.org. But it has not gotten much attention in the land of lobster, at least not yet. No one at Equality Maine, the state's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organization, had heard of the campaign before being contacted by the Press Herald.
"I would be surprised if this caught on here," said executive director Matt Moonen. "It's basically already a symbol of our entire state."
The Mainer who kicked off the online lobster emoji campaign, Luke Holden, of Luke's Lobster, said he doesn't mind sharing.
"Lobster is for everyone," the Cape Elizabeth native said by email. "So until Unicode does right by the trans community, we fully support using the lobster emoji to advocate for their right to be represented."
The campaign is the brainchild of Charlie Craggs, a British author, activist and nail artist, but she is not the only one asking Unicode for a trans flag emoji. Another group of activists, including Washington, D.C., physician Ted Eytan and Georgia Navy veteran Monica Helms, who created the trans flag back in 1999, started asking Unicode for a trans flag emoji two years ago.
"I respect the frustration and creativity that has come together for #ClawsOutForTrans," Eytan said. "Successful social movements often have these elements. I am completely in support of their health, safety and enjoyment of life, made better through visible representation of their existence."
Unicode hasn't outright denied the trans flag symbol, Eytan said. Rather, in correspondence with him, Eytan said the consortium said it needs more information, such as proof that it is needed and that desire for the symbol isn't already covered by the gay pride flag emoji. But activists point out that many trans people, who represent about 0.5 percent of the U.S. population, are not gay.
But why the lobster? Why not the softball or the pirate flag that was added in the same class of new pictograms as the lobster?
Some trans advocates say it is a good example of transgender people being passed over for a much smaller but mainstream group -- 20 million trans people worldwide versus 1.3 Mainers -- but others like the idea of claiming the lobster as a symbol of trans pride because it can be a gynandromorph, or have both male and female characteristics.
According to Rick Wahle, a lobster biologist at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center, it is rare for lobsters to exhibit both female and male anatomy, but not impossible.
It is a developmental anomaly that happens early in the embryonic development, he said. Its sex chromosomes do not divide properly, leading to divergent anatomy on different sides of the body.
Trans advocates call this biological fact -- one also be found in some birds, mollusks and fish -- a nice "twist of fate" for their mission.

Panelists: New Lay's chips don't taste like New England lobster

Full text: The "Chopped" champion was skeptical. So was the Maine potato chip maker. And the food truck owner? She was "almost afraid" of what she would find inside the bag in front of her.
All three expert panelists cast a wary eye at the bag of Lay's New England Lobster Roll potato chips given to them for an informal tasting on Tuesday. The chips are one of eight new "regionally-inspired flavors" created by Lay's, the same folks who brought you the Southern Biscuits and Gravy chip a few years ago.
Sarah Sutton, owner of the Bite into Maine food truck that sells fresh lobster rolls by the sea at Fort Williams Park in Cape Elizabeth, perused the label on the packaging. "They actually have a New England Lobster Roll Seasoning," she said. She began reading off the ingredients: salt, skim milk, spices, maltodextrin, yeast, sour cream. "OK, the sour cream I like. Butter I like. Brown sugar I like."
Kelly Brodeur, owner of Vintage Maine Kitchen, a Freeport-based company that makes potato chips from Maine potatoes, poked her nose in the bag and noted the chips smelled like sour cream and onion chips.
Matt Ginn, the executive chef at Evo Kitchen & Bar in Portland who was a winner on the Food Network show "Chopped" last month and was the 2015 Maine Lobster Chef of the Year, said he was expecting the chips to taste something like a Japanese shrimp cracker made with dehydrated shrimp. But he observed that there appeared to be no animal products in the lobster roll chips. "No prawn, no anchovy, no nothing," he said. "It doesn't smell bad at all. I'm havin' at it."
With that, all three tasters dug in, crunching away in silence.
Their verdict: Where's the lobster?
"I'm getting no lobster at all," Ginn said. "This does not taste like a lobster roll."
The other two agreed.
"To me, it starts like it tastes like sour cream and onion, and then it finishes with something I can't explain," Sutton said.
"Like paprika," Ginn said, "or ..."
"Or toast," Brodeur chimed in.
The panelists -- thanks, perhaps, to Brodeur tasting hints of toast -- all eventually picked up on the flavor of a griddled, buttery roll in the chips. And they suspected the suggestion of paprika might be coming from a Lay's version of Old Bay-like seasoning -- perhaps the same seasoning used on the new Chesapeake Bay Crab Spice chips? The other Tastes of America flavors released regionally Monday by Lay's are Pimento Cheese (Southeast), Cajun Spice (Gulf Coast), Chile Con Queso (Southwest), Deep Dish Pizza (mid-America), Fried Pickles (Midwest) and Thai Sweet Chile (Pacific Northwest). Flavors from outside the region can be purchased online.
There was some discussion among the panelists about the possible reasons for the lack of real lobster flavor in the chips. Using lobster would be expensive, of course, but it also might be dangerous for people with shellfish allergies, they concluded.
Ginn, who was expecting a delivery of 20 lobsters at his restaurant that night, was nevertheless inspired. "If you give me two days," he said, "I'll make a lobster chip that actually tastes like lobster."
How? Roast the lobster "bones" on low overnight until fragrant and dehydrated. Then grind them into a fine powder. Add salt, sugar and preservatives, then fry up some potato chips and dust them with the powder. Voila -- real lobster-flavored potato chips.
And what would Ginn have done with these chips if they'd turned up as a mystery basket ingredient on his episode of "Chopped?"
"Maybe I'd crush them up," he said. "I guess we'd have to know what else is in the basket. If they gave me these and some lobster, or these and some fish, maybe I'd make some kind of panko dredge and use them to bread something, see if we could repurpose the texture on them a little bit."
Lay's will be promoting the New England Lobster Roll chips Thursday at the Maine Lobster Festival in Rockland. Hannah Hart, host of the Food Network Show "I Hart Food," will join Lynn Archer, owner of The Brass Compass Café and Archer's on the Pier, in a live cooking show at 3 p.m. They'll be preparing Archer's "King of Clubs," a lobster club sandwich that was once featured on "Throwdown with Bobby Flay."
Despite their disappointment that the lobster roll chips tasted more like sour cream and onion than seafood, everyone on our panel admitted that they've never met a potato chip they didn't like. And they figure anything that gets people talking about one of Maine's most valuable industries can't be all bad.
"Every time they talk about lobsters, lobster rolls and chips," Brodeur said, "it's good for everybody."

1 million gallons of sewage spill out into Casco Bay

Full text: An estimated 1 million gallons of partially treated sewage spilled out of Portland's wastewater treatment plant and into Casco Bay on Thursday morning, washing away a section of the Eastern Prome Trail, closing East End Beach and raising questions about whether to hold the annual open-water swim from Peaks Island to Portland that is scheduled for Saturday.
The wastewater overflowed from a treatment tank and poured into the bay to the west of the beach and a boat launch. It already had gone through part of the treatment process in which solids are removed. This is the first time the plant has an experienced an overflow of this type, said Michelle Clements, spokeswoman for the Portland Water District, which operates the plant.
The water district reported the incident to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, which sent an inspector to the plant Thursday. A spokesman said the department could change the plant's operational plan or impose a monetary penalty in response to the spill.
"PWD will submit a full written report on the incident within five days and DEP will determine what actions may be appropriate based on the facts surrounding this event," the department said in a statement.
Clements said heavy rain that fell on Portland overnight contributed to the spill. The city's sewer system fills with stormwater during heavy rain, adding to the typical 20 million gallons flowing into the plant each day.
The wastewater came from a disinfection tank where chlorination and dechlorination occurs at the end of the treatment process, Clements said. One of the two chlorine-contact tanks was drained for cleaning Wednesday, but the valves to let wastewater back into the tank had not been reopened. The surge of water during the overnight storm overwhelmed the other tank and it began to overflow. Each tank can hold 400,000 gallons.
The water had been chlorinated, Clements said, but it did not sit for the required minimum 30 minutes in the contact tank, and the chlorine had not been removed yet as it normally would be before the effluent is released into Casco Bay.
"That contact time is important to get that full disinfection," Clements said.
Officials estimate the overflow occurred for less than an hour beginning at 6:45 a.m. A person on the Eastern Prom Trail reported the overflow to the city of Portland, which alerted the water district. Clements said she did not know why the plant staff did not realize the overflow was happening, and that question will be part of the investigation.
"We're just currently focused on getting restoration of the trail and getting information to everyone," Clements said. "After this initial phase, our staff will be detailing everything in a report about what happened."
Cathy Ramdsell, executive director of the Friends of Casco Bay, credited the water district with responding quickly to the spill. Still, it will be hard to quantify the damage done. Ramsdell said any remaining bacteria, pathogens or chlorine could be a risk to both people and marine life. The organization will be watching for any ramifications in nearby Back Cove, where algal blooms have happened in the past.
"This is an acute insult to the health of the bay," Ramsdell said. "We never like to see that."
Ramsdell said the Friends of Casco Bay works closely with the water district and appreciates the work they do at the East End plant.
"Accidents happen," she said. "We felt heartsick about this, both for them and the bay."
A spokeswoman for the Maine Department of Marine Resources said the area near the wastewater treatment plant in Portland already was prohibited for shellfish growing and harvesting, and there are no additional closures associated with the spill.
Maine Healthy Beaches conducts routine water quality testing at East End Beach and took a sample Thursday morning. The test takes 24 hours, so results will not be available until today. Meaghan Sims, the program coordinator from the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, said they are looking into their options to test the water today, as well. She declined to comment on the seriousness of the spill and referred other questions to the Maine DEP.
Clements said the sewage treatment plant was running normally Thursday, and there was no noticeable odor in the area several hours after the spill.
The water district is responsible for repairs to the Eastern Prom Trail, but it was unclear Thursday what the cost would be. The city said the popular walking, running and biking trail will reopen Wednesday. Until then, barricades have been placed around the damaged section.
A runner on the trail Thursday morning paused briefly at the barrier, swore and turned around. Nik Coggins, 26, stopped his bike at one of the barricades and peered beyond it. He was on a bike ride around the city and did not mind changing his route, but he was surprised to see the extent of the damage.
"It looks like Colorado, like a rock slide," Coggins said.
It was not immediately clear if the spill would affect Saturday's annual Peaks to Portland Swim to Benefit Kids, a significant fundraiser for the YMCA of Southern Maine. An expected 450 swimmers, who have raised about $180,000 for the local YMCA, are supposed to finish a 2.4-mile swim across Casco Bay at East End Beach.
"We're still assessing our options," said Meaghan Woodsome, the marketing director of the YMCA of Southern Maine. "We are still trying to gather information. We have a day or two to figure it out."
An email to participants Thursday said the organizers would make a final decision about the race today, when the results of water testing will be available.
"We are hopeful that the race will proceed as planned -- we know how important it is for our swimmers and want to see their training and hard work in action," the message from the YMCA states. "At the same time, we take the safety and health of all race participants very seriously and will make a decision based on this, in cooperation with our race partners."

Full text: 'Today' segment to show lobster, clamming, camp
Hey Mainers, on Tuesday, celebrity weatherman Al Roker will know exactly what's happening in your neck of the woods -- because it'll be his neck of the woods too.
Roker and a crew from NBC's "Today" show will film some of Tuesday's show from the midcoast town of Georgetown. It's part of a travel segment that will show Roker clamming, lobstering and camping in Maine. Roker said Thursday morning that he doesn't know all the details yet, and that's fine with him. He's a big believer in the energy and power of live television, and he thinks that's a big reason the "Today" show has been on the air since 1952.
"Yeah, we're doing this on the fly, which is great, and it's what people have come to expect from us. It's one of things I love about doing this," said Roker, 63. "I know there will be water and mollusks."
Roker has been a "Today" weather forecaster and anchor since 1996. One of his signature phrases on the show, to introduce local weather forecasts at the end of the national one, is "here's what's happening in your neck of the woods."
Roker's Maine adventure is part of the "Today" show's "Great Outdoor Series." Roker and show co-anchor Craig Melvin will begin a New England trek Monday in Boston, broadcasting live and seeing sights, before hitting the road for Maine. Roker said he'll probably visit places along the Maine coast, though he's not sure which ones.
Roker and Melvin will pitch a tent at Sagadahoc Bay Campground in Georgetown, south of Bath. The campground is not far from Reid State Park and has views of Seguin Island Light. While in Georgetown, Roker said, he'll also do some clam digging and go out on a lobster boat for the TV segment, though he's not sure where.
Though Roker grew up in New York City, he has some shellfishing experience. He said his father use to take him crabbing off Rockaway Beach in Queens.
"I've dealt with crab traps, but not lobster traps. Usually when I deal with lobster, someone else has found it," Roker said.
When asked why Maine, and specifically Georgetown, was picked for the "Great Outdoor Series," Roker said that Maine is a place that comes quickly to mind when considering summer activities.
"It's summer. It's Maine. Why not?" Roker said.
Roker has been to Maine at least a couple times before. He has a specific memory of a family vacation at a campground near Kennebunk some 25 years ago.
"I had never seen horseflies that big. Those things had saddles on them," Roker said.
Besides hosting "Today," Roker has written several books. His latest, "Ruthless Tide," came out in June and is about the Johnstown Flood in Pennsylvania in 1889.
The "Today" show airs weekdays at 7 a.m. and can be seen locally on Portland's News Center Maine on Channel 6.

Kelly is the author of "Today's Real Kitchens & Interior Designs." His new book, "Living Designs," will be available this summer.
Kelly's designs have also been featured in national design magazines and on HGTV.
The Best Of Houzz in Customer Service award is based on several factors including the number and quality of client reviews a professional received in 2017. A "Best Of Houzz 2018" badge has been posted on TRK Design Company's Houzz profile.
"Receiving a Houzz award for the third time is something we take great pride in, along with earning four other Houzz badges," Kelly said, according to the release.
First Maine lawyer elected to Board of National Lawyers Association
Jeffrey Neil Young is the first Maine lawyer ever elected to the Board of the largest civil rights organization in the country dedicated to workers' rights, the National Employment Lawyers Association. He is a partner in the largest employment and civil rights law firm north of Boston. His firm, Johnson, Webbert & Young LLP, in Augusta, represents workers and individuals throughout Maine and New England. NELA is headquartered in California, with an office in DC, and has over 4,000 attorney members nationwide, and its Maine affiliate has over 50 members.
Young has won many landmark verdicts and court rulings in employment and civil rights cases.
Young stated, "I am honored that my peers from across the country saw fit to elect me to the NELA Board. NELA is second to none when it comes to fighting for the legal rights of working men and women, especially those who are not protected by unions. I look forward to working on national efforts to preserve and expand protections for all workers." Young's term begins on July 1 and lasts three years.
Coast of Maine Organic donates $10,000 worth of compost to schools
In 2018 Coast of Maine Organic Products Inc. established "Growing Good" program, where instead of a monetary donation, a donation of up to 10 bags of Coast of Maine products is made to school garden programs all across New England, according to a news release. This year, while working in cooperation with the Maine School Garden Network, Coast of Maine donated more than $10,000 worth of their Quoddy Blend Organic Lobster Compost (700-plus bags) to more than 70 school gardens across Maine, from Kittery to Houlton.
"Our donation helps fund the school's garden and brings the local retailer closer to the community. It also serves and acts as a seed starter for kid's lifelong love of gardening, health and the environment. In short we all win," said Director of Marketing Cameron Bonsey, according to the release.
Because it has long been the philosophy of the Coast of Maine brand, that their locally made products should only be sold by local independent retailers/garden centers, (never in "big box stores") Coast of Maine asked the school's garden coordinators to not only pick up their donations at their local garden centers, but to also thank them publicly on their social media pages as well. The garden centers were credited for the sale of the product by Coast of Maine and the garden coordinators supported their local community businesses, according to the release.
Coast of Maine Organic Products Inc. is a company founded in Maine that has been producing truly exceptional, organically approved, compost-based soils, enriching mulches, soil supplements and liquid fertilizers, since 1996. They compost residuals sourced locally in Maine and New Brunswick, such as shellfish (lobster and crab), salmon, wild blueberries and cow manure. Additional local ingredients include: tree bark, worm castings and seaweed. The company distributes their organic retail bagged goods to independent garden centers and retailers along the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.
Local schools include:
[bullet] Good Will Hinckley, Hinckley
[bullet] Hall-Dale Elementary School, Hallowell
[bullet] Lincoln Elementary School, Augusta
[bullet] Maine School Garden Network, Augusta
[bullet] Messalonskee High School, Oakland

Full text: Researchers: Heating ocean has impact on lobster, clam fisheries in Maine
AUGUSTA -- Two new scientific studies are highlighting the current and future impacts that rising ocean temperatures will have on lobster, clams and other important commercial fisheries in the Gulf of Maine.
Research of nearly 700 North American fish species predicts Atlantic cod habitat could shrink by as much as 90 percent by century's end and that lobster populations could shift 200 miles farther north as a result of climate change. Meanwhile, a separate research project suggests Maine's soft-shell clam industry could collapse unless steps are taken to protect the fishery from green crabs thriving in the state's warming waters.
"Something is out of whack and we need to do something about it. We need to adapt," said University of Maine professor Brian Beal, who has studied soft-shell clams for more than 30 years.
The studies are part of a growing body of scientific work seeking to understand -- and look beyond -- changes that fishermen across the country are witnessing on the water every day.
In the Gulf of Maine, which is among the fastest-warming bodies of water on the globe, cod and northern shrimp as well as other once-abundant species are experiencing long-term declines despite severe limits on fishing. Meanwhile, southerly species such as black sea bass and squid are edging into New England waters once considered too cold.
Research published this week in the journal PLOS ONE used data from more than 130,000 bottom trawls as well as 16 different climate models to estimate the current and future distribution of 686 fish and invertebrate species along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
The models used low and high emissions levels of climate-warming gases to calculate impacts, with the lower forecasts tied to levels set in the 2016 Paris Accord agreement. President Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from that agreement.
Overall, the research predicts hundreds of species will shift northward, further disrupting some of the nation's most important commercial fisheries. In Maine, some of Maine's most economically and culturally significant species -- including lobster, scallops, shrimp and groundfish -- could find the cooler waters to the north in Canada more hospitable if ocean temperatures continue to rise at the current pace.
The study led by researchers at Rutgers University predicted that:
[bullet] The remaining U.S. Atlantic cod habitat -- primarily off New England's coast -- could shrink by 90 percent by 2100.
[bullet] Lobster distribution could shift another 200 miles north, putting more of the crustaceans in Canadian waters and out of reach of Maine fishermen.
[bullet] Likewise, populations of Atlantic sea scallops that fetched Maine fishermen $9.3 million last year could shift more than 430 miles northward.
"It's quite striking how fast the Gulf of Maine is warming and is projected to warm in the future, so we do expect large impacts on the Gulf of Maine," said Malin Pinsky, an associate professor at Rutgers University's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Natural Resources and one of the lead authors of the study. "Some species are moving out but other species are moving in. And so, from a fisheries perspective, the question is can fisheries managers figure out that transition?"
Maine fishermen landed nearly $570 million worth of seafood last year, making commercial fishing one of the state's largest industries.
Maine's lobster landings fell 15 percent in 2017 to 110.8 million pounds worth an estimated $434 million. While not unexpected after a string of record-breaking years, some studies have raised concerns that lobster larvae are declining in numbers.
"It does suggest that the habitat will decline," Pinsky, a native of Machias and Orono, said of his group's study. "The question is will the habitat decline to a point where it cannot support a fishery?"
The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than nearly every other part of the world's oceans, according to studies by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and other organizations. A recent study by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that surface waters on the Gulf of Maine waters could warm by 6.7 degrees over the next 80 years, which is twice the warming rate witnessed over the past 30 years.
As waters warm, they become less hospitable to the cold-loving species such as cod and other groundfish that were the backbone of the coastal New England economy for hundreds of years. As in Pinsky's broader study, the NOAA research suggests the Gulf of Maine could experience sharp declines in groundfish abundance in the coming decades.
The temperature rise combined with other climatic changes also affects the abundance of important food sources, such as phytoplankton. A 2016 study by researchers at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, for instance, found that increased precipitation over the past 80 years and the resulting surge in freshwater has changed the color of the Gulf of Maine, making it more difficult for phytoplankton to compete for sunlight needed to survive.
Beal's research group at the University of Maine at Machias, meanwhile, says the changes have already had dramatic impacts on southern Maine's soft-shell clam population. And without an "introduction of some revolutionary thinking to the clam industry," Beal said, Maine may not have much of an industry left in the near future as one of the most voracious invasive species in Maine, the green crab, spreads and multiples in the warming waters.
In research conducted largely around Casco Bay over a four-year period, Beal compared clam survival rates inside special contraptions designed to keep out predators with clams located in the adjacent mud. And the results were striking: While they found hundreds or even thousands of clams ranging in size from one-eighth of an inch to 1½ inches inside the simple "boxes," just outside of the protected area there were practically none to be found.
"There are a variety of predators, so it's not just green crabs and milky ribbon worms," Beal said. "There are fish ... and birds that prey on clams, but I would say the most important predator that is preying on clams is the green crab."
A native of Europe, green crabs have been in Maine waters for roughly a century. But their numbers have exploded in the past decade, a trend that Beal and other researchers say is directly tied to warming waters. That's because the small crabs' predation rate and reproduction increase in higher temperatures.
Back when Beal first began conducting professional research in the mid-1980s, it was possible to get survival rates of 50 to 60 percent for young clams placed in unprotected areas. Now, they are seeing survival rates of 5 percent or less. In some areas of Casco Bay, less than 0.01 percent of juvenile clams survived beyond their first year, he said.
In 2017, Maine reported the smallest commercial clam harvest -- 6.9 million pounds worth $12.4 million -- since 1930. While part of that drop was due to harvesting closures because of harmful algal blooms, the number of licensed clammers in the state has fallen by roughly 75 percent since the mid-1970s.
"We are going to lose an iconic fishery, and we are going to lose it either because people don't care about it or they just don't believe" in the science, said Beal.
For his part, Beal said towns or individuals need to begin using some form of predator-exclusion devices, which he believes is likely workable on plots of 2 to 5 acres. Additionally, Beal said the state needs to protect the largest and most reproductively valuable clams from harvesting -- as is done in the lobster fishery -- while instituting "rolling closures" along the coast that protect clam flats during peak spawning times.
Acknowledging the politics of climate change, Beal said the reality is the Gulf of Maine is warming even if people want to debate the reasons why. He and other researchers would like to see water temperatures decline yet the current trend and the models suggest that is not likely. And that means green crabs will likely continue to flourish in the warming waters off Maine's coast.
"There is no predator that can even match the prowess of the green crab," Beal said, pointing out that the species thrives in all types of shoreline and eats almost anything but appears to have a special shine for shellfish. "They're here and no one is going to fish them out. So what we need to do is adapt to them."
Pinsky with Rutgers University said he hopes his group's study will "lay bare some of the choices ahead of us" as policymakers debate how aggressive to be in seeking to limit emissions of climate-warming gases.
"Sticking to the Paris agreement wold help our fisheries significantly," Pinsky said.

Maine DEP hears testimony on greenhouse gas initiative

Full text: Grassroots effort taps little-used statute to force action
AUGUSTA -- Maine environmental regulators heard hours of testimony Tuesday on a citizen-initiated proposal that would require the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent annually while imposing new regulations on the trucking and biomass industries.
Tapping a little-used section of state law, a grass-roots group of attorneys and activists submitted nearly 700 petition signatures from registered voters calling for tougher standards on emissions of carbon dioxide and other climate-warming gases. As a result, the Department of Environmental Protection is required to begin rulemaking on a proposal that supporters -- including roughly a dozen middle and high school students -- contend is necessary to reduce emissions that threaten Maine's lobster and shellfish fisheries, seaside towns and public health.
"We know that this issue is real and that this is going to be one of the biggest issues that we face as a generation," said Ryan O'Leary, a Scarborough High School junior who was one of roughly a dozen students to speak Tuesday. "We are doing all that we can right now to combat it, but, at the same time, we realize that in order to truly preserve our beloved state for years to come ... we need bold support and direct action from the DEP."
Some business groups, however, decried the proposal as an unrealistic over-regulation that would make Maine even less competitive than other states.
"This whole concept is impossible to do and, if implemented, would shut down all large manufacturing in Maine," warned Jim Robbins, of Robbins Lumber Inc. in Searsport. "Those jobs would then be exported to China, which is the worst polluting country in the world."
The rulemaking petition filed with the DEP in January would set a new, statewide carbon dioxide emission limit of 17.55 million metric tons starting in 2021. Using that figure as a baseline, the proposal calls for the state to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 8 percent every year through 2035, thereby achieving a 75 percent to 80 percent reduction in emissions over 2003 levels.
Additionally, the proposed rules would require businesses that emit 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually -- as well as trucking fleets that generate 5,000 tons of the gas annually -- to file plans detailing how they will reduce emissions by 8 percent each year. The rules also would impose limits on emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, an electrical insulator that is thousands of times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
A group of attorneys from 350 Maine, Our Children's Trust, Citizens Climate Lobby and the Conservation Law Foundation as well as a half-dozen or so other activists submitted the rulemaking petition in January after collecting 696 valid signatures from registered voters. One of those attorneys, Beth Fuller Valentine, of Gorham, said the petition builds on a first-in-the-nation law passed in 2003 that set short-term and long-term goals for reducing emissions in Maine.
"Maine met the short-term goal through 2010 and is on track to meet the goal through 2020," Valentine said. "But we are here today because Maine's efforts to date are simply not sufficient to meet the long-term goal, which directs Maine to reduce emissions 'sufficient to eliminate any dangerous threat to the climate.'"
However, attorneys for large manufacturers as well as the Maine Forest Products Council -- an industry trade group representing mills, forestland owners and logging truck operators -- said Maine already is helping lead the national efforts to reduce emissions of climate-warming gases. They pointed to the 2003 law as well as Maine's participation in the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the nation's first cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce emissions from fuel-burning power plants.
If the DEP were to approve the rules, opponents warned, it would place unmeetable expectations and regulatory burdens on manufacturers, biomass plants, and trucking companies, as well as some hospitals and colleges.
"It's not that we are opposed to reducing (greenhouse gas) emissions; instead, we are opposed to these proposals because they are simply impractical," said Lisa Gilbreath, an attorney representing unnamed large manufacturers in Maine. "We're not aware of any such requirements in other states. But we need to remain competitive, and these proposals would put Maine manufacturers at a big disadvantage."
Maine law allows residents to petition any department to commence rulemaking on a specific issue. Agencies have 60 days to initiate the rulemaking process after receiving a request from at least 150 registered voters. But the law does not necessarily require departments to adopt the rules, and the administration of outgoing Gov. Paul LePage -- a Republican who was elected eight years ago on a pledge to rollback environmental red tape -- is unlikely to go along with environmental regulations opposed by major segments of Maine's business industry.
Yet scientists and fishermen told DEP representatives Tuesday that Maine can longer afford to delay taking more decisive action on climate-warming emissions.
University of Maine soil scientist Ivan Fernandez said he had not studied the details of the proposed emissions standards, but agreed with the push to further reduce emissions levels. A faculty member with UMaine's Climate Change Institute, Fernandez said Maine farmers are experiencing more droughts, Lyme disease is spreading rapidly as the climate warms and fishermen are facing increasingly acidic waters as the oceans absorb more carbon dioxide from the air.
"If the only concern from rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were ocean acidification, we would still have a burgeoning global crisis with Maine on the front lines," Fernandez said.
Richard Nelson, a retired lobsterman from Friendship, said fishermen are seeing the effects of climate change on a daily basis. Fish that used to be plentiful off Maine's coast are moving farther north as the Gulf of Maine warms -- a trend that Nelson said threatens the viability of Maine's iconic lobster industry. Additionally, ocean acidification could affect the ability of lobster and other organisms to form shells.
"All evidence suggests that any measure that would reduce the fossil fuels along with CO2 emissions would also limit the detrimental effects of climate change and ocean acidification that threaten our industry," said Nelson, who served on a ocean acidification task force created by the Legislature.

Full text: Fatal home invasion suspect enters plea
BANGOR ï¿½ A woman who is charged with two others in a fatal home invasion in Maine has pleaded not guilty.
The Bangor Daily News reported 21-year-old Alexis Locklear, of Maxton, North Carolina, was arraigned Friday in Bangor on one count each of felony murder and robbery. Locklearï¿½s father, 43-year-old Tony Locklear, and her boyfriend, 38-year-old Christopher Murray, both previously pleaded not guilty to intentional or knowing murder, elevated aggravated assault and robbery.
Police said Wayne Lapierre was shot inside his Millinocket home on Dec. 19 and died at a hospital. Lapierreï¿½s wife was injured, but survived.
Prosecutors said the three targeted Lapierre because he was a licensed medical marijuana grower who owned several businesses.
All three are scheduled to go on trial January 2019.
Maine excludes vets from prescribing law
AUGUSTA ï¿½ Maine is loosening restrictions on veterinarians who prescribe opioids for animals.
A new law removes a requirement that all vets check the prescription history of the individual who brought in the animal. It also lifts a requirement to check Maineï¿½s prescription monitoring system when vets provide less than a two-day supply of opioids or tranquilizers to animals in an emergency or mobile setting.
Veterinarians argued Maineï¿½s strict opioid prescribing law didnï¿½t consider issues like privacy concerns raised by allowing veterinarians to check human medical records. One veterinarian said Maineï¿½s law kept her from providing medicine to a horse she visited on a farm that died.
The law will become effective 90 days after lawmakers officially end work this year. That day could be as early as Wednesday.
Authorities warn of hungry black bears
AUGUSTA ï¿½ Authorities in Maine are warning people not to leave food out in their yards and risk attracting hungry black bears as they come out of hibernation.
Compiled from wire reports Jen Vashon, a biologist for the stateï¿½s wildlife department, said that bear complaints could be higher than usual this year thanks to the delayed spring weather. She said the department has already investigated 27 complaints so far this spring.
Vashon said natural food for bears is scarcest this time of year, so some may venture into peopleï¿½s backyards looking for something to eat.
The Portland Press Herald reported that Kennebunk police have confirmed several bear sightings and are urging people to be mindful of what they leave out.
Rising waters bring trouble in northern Maine, 1 evacuated
WESTMANLAND ï¿½ Maine state officials say rising waters are a problem in a tiny town in far northern Maine where at least one person had to be evacuated by airboat.
The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife said game wardens used the airboat on Friday in Westmanland to evacuate one woman and bring supplies to others. Westmanland is a town of 62 people near Canada.
The agency said rising water levels on Madawaska Stream have isolated some people in their homes due to rains and higher temperatures. At least one road was rendered impassable.
The National Weather Service in Caribou also issued a flood advisory on Monday for minor flooding in poor rain and snowmelt drainage areas in northeastern Aroostook County in northern Maine. Westmanland is in that area.
Maine group to use grant to explore Japanese scallop farming
PORTLAND ï¿½ A Maine firm is set to receive a $300,000 grant to work on a scallop farming technique that has helped the valuable shellfish grow faster in Japan.
Coastal Enterprises Inc. will receive the money via The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, which is a nonprofit corporation set up by the farm bill in 2014. Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine said the money will help Coastal research the farming of sea scallops in ï¿½groundbreaking new ways.ï¿½
Coastal will investigate the economic viability of the Japanese technique, which Pingree said has also been shown to grow larger, meatier scallops.
The money is part of a round of grants from The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research that will be matched by five companies, an industry group and three universities.
Spring turkey hunt opens to all hunters in Maine
AUGUSTA ï¿½ Maineï¿½s annual spring turkey hunt is now open to all hunters in the state.
The hunt began Saturday with Youth Spring Wild Turkey Day. It begins Monday for everyone else, and takes place across the state until June 2.
State authorities announced on Friday that the season was closed in parts of the Skowhegan and Norridgewock areas because of a search for a fugitive suspected in the killing of a Maine deputy.
That order remains in effect for Monday even though the fugitive was taken into custody over the weekend.
Maine hunters are limited to two bearded wild turkeys in most of the state. There are stricter limits in far northern Maine.

Full text: Response from feds in monument suit due
PORTLAND ï¿½ The federal governmentï¿½s response to a lawsuit from fishermen trying to eliminate former President Barack Obamaï¿½s Atlantic Ocean monument is coming due.
The fishing groups sued to challenge the 2016 creation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. The monument is a 5,000-square-mile area off of New England and is the first monument of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean.
A federal court ordered the U.S. Department of Commerce to respond to the lawsuit by April 16. It was filed at U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
Marine national monuments are underwater areas designed to protect unique or vulnerable ecosystems.
Woman: I was shackled in dog cage
PORTLAND ï¿½ A Maine woman who said she was taken from Florida to Maine while shackled inside of a dog cage has filed a federal lawsuit against Maine county officials and the contracted private transportation company.
Meghan Quinn said she was arrested in Florida in 2016 on an outstanding warrant in Androscoggin County in her lawsuit filed Wednesday. The 35-year-old Quinn alleges she was subsequently taken from Florida to Maine on a ï¿½zigzaggingï¿½ five-day drive.
Quinn said she was shackled in a cage covered in her own blood, urine and fecal matter for most of the trip. She is seeking unspecified damages.
Androscoggin County officials said they have stopped using Florida-based U.S. Prisoner Transport.
The private company previously said an internal report found no violations of standard procedure.
Solar customers to get fewer incentives
AUGUSTA ï¿½ Maine regulators can move ahead on plans to gradually provide fewer bill credits for new buyers of solar panels.
A House vote Tuesday killed a bill aiming to lessen the impact of the Maine Public Utilities Commissionï¿½s proposal to ramp down compensation for new solar panel owners. Supporters said the bill would prohibit regulators from charging solar customers a fee for generated power used in homes or businesses.
The Houseï¿½s 96-50 vote wasnï¿½t enough to override Republican Gov. Paul LePageï¿½s veto. The Senate recently overrode the veto.
Solar installers said the regulations would dissuade residents and small businesses from installing panels. A lawsuit claiming the regulations amount to a new tax is pending in state court.
Lobstermen to get extension on waivers
AUGUSTA ï¿½ A Maine proposal is now on the books to extend the amount of time some commercial fishing license holders can receive a medical waiver.
Harpswell Democratic Rep. Jay McCreightï¿½s proposal allows the Maine Department of Marine Resources commissioner to renew a temporary medical waiver for lobster and crab fishing licenses up to one year.
McCreight said she was motivated to make the proposal at the request of a Harpswell lobsterman who needed help because heï¿½s struggling with a terminal illness, but still needs to work.
McCreight said she also plans to work on a potential solution next year that would allow qualified family members to fish using the license of a sick relative.
Resurgent scallop fishery season ending
PORTLAND ï¿½ Maineï¿½s scallop fishery is reaching the end of a season that showed signs of further rebuilding.
The fishery collapsed in the mid-2000s and has steadily rebuilt amid new management measures over the last few years. Tuesday was the final day of the 2017-18 season for scallop draggers to harvest the shellfish.
The fishery still includes a few divers who harvest scallops by hand, and they can continue working until April 15.
The season runs from December to April every year. Fishermen harvested more than 790,000 pounds of scallops during the 2017 calendar year, which included the first month of the 2017-18 fishing season. That was the highest total since 1997.

Full text: Easter 1936, maybe. It rained. I ate an entire 10-inch chocolate bunny, starting with the ears, and then threw up.
Easter 1938, I think. I got chicken pox. Egg hunt canceled.
Easter 1940. My father had died March 1. My older sisters insisted on coloring and hiding eggs for my baby sister's sake. I got mumps.
Easter 1942. War happened. All of my brothers joined the Navy. Standing room only at Mass. Not much enthusiasm for an egg hunt. Went to afternoon movie. Disney, I think.
Easter Sunday 1947. Gas is 15 cents a gallon, Wonder Bread 7 cents a loaf, and you could get a big bowl of chili at Auel's Cafe for 25 cents, oyster crackers included. This was my first grown-up Easter.
There was Easter Mass with all of the attendant finery. I had helped color eggs the night before for my baby sister and had gotten up early to hide them in the dewy, wet grass. There was an Easter dinner somewhere, for sure, but I had to go to work.
I had an after-school job that spring and into summer working for my cousin Pete's two bars in St. Louis: The Bungalow Bar and Grill out on Chippewa Street and the Four Aces Bar and Grill on Cherokee Street, where daily, I replenished the two beer coolers and put out the cold cuts buffet, swept down and mopped the floor and put out the trash. That job helped me get a charge card at Famous and Barr's Department Store, where I bought my first Easter blue blazer and gabardine slacks. Grown-up stuff.
I was no longer an altar boy at Easter, so I got to sit in the pews. It was a special feeling.
There was a girl there with her grandmother. My mother said her name was Rosemary. Oh, oh!
I remember the unusually hot summer night some years later when this Rosemary asked me to dance at the Loughborough YMCA's Tuesday night dance party.
There she was all grown up and looking for all the world like white fudge wrapped in cellophane and drenched in something called "White Shoulders" perfume. Doris Day was on the juke box singing "It's Magic." It was.
How can I remember something so long ago? Someone once said, "In every man's life, there is a summer, and a girl."
Besides, some things you smell on a hot breezeless summer night when you're young stick with you until they bury you.
"You were an altar boy?" Rosemary whispered in my ear.
"Yeah."
A long pause while I inhaled clouds of White Shoulders.
"Seriously?"
"Yeah."
Another long pause, another inhalation.
"You're kidding."
"No."
"Can I come and see you do it?"
"I don't do it anymore."
"Oh."
Easter Sunday 1951. Louisiana Tech, Ruston, Louisiana. Joyce Ann was a strict Baptist and a Kappa Delta girl who drove us to Easter service in her Daddy's (J.R.) white Cadillac convertible, with red leather seats, steer horns on front. Easter dinner of ham, grits, sweet potato pie, lemonade and mint juleps.
Easter Sunday 1954. Tokyo, Japan. Easter dinner at the Diamond Hotel, two blocks down from the Ginza and the Imperial Palace. Sgt. Richard Basinger and a Japanese girl whose name I never knew, and Barbara Johansen, a Red Cross Grey Lady volunteer who taught me how to say "I love you" and "You have freckles on your back" in Danish.
They served the traditional American ham and sweet potatoes, but we ate from the Japanese menu. A lot of noodles and fish and my first taste of sake.
Easter Sunday 1959. My new girlfriend, Katherine Joly, of Waterville, Maine, and I walked in the famous Easter Parade.
She wore a great hat from a hometown store named Alvina's and Delia's.
She remembers my tweed jacket, tattersall Westcott vest and tweed Irish hat.
We joined my old actor friend Franklin Cover, who went on to play Tom Willis on "The Jeffersons."
We had martinis at the Plaza Hotel. Kay had a Manhattan. We had Easter dinner somewhere else, just the two of us. We don't remember the restaurant. I wore Bay Rum cologne, Kay wore Chanel No. 5. Easter Sunday 2018. Waterville, Maine. To be continued. Go hunt your eggs.

Slower may be better for lobster

Full text: Company thinks future of exports will look different than speedy present
When shipping live lobster, faster is usually better. Most lobster exporters dream of finding the most direct flight into Spain or the quickest customs line into China.
But a company with roots in the Canadian fishery thinks the future of lobster exporting lies in going more slowly, not faster. Live Stor America wants lobster dealers to ditch the expensive airplane trips and use their irrigated, refrigerated crate and container system to ship their product, literally, to Europe and Asia. While it takes a lot longer, ocean transit using this system costs less than flying, and the amount of lobster that dies in transit is much lower, the company says.
"We think this is going to revolutionize the lobstering industry," said Allan Gillis, a partner in the storage, shipping and crate and container companies espousing the idea.
The idea has met with some skepticism from dealers who say the price volatility and fragile biology of exporting live lobster require speedy deliveries.
But Gillis believes the industry will come around when he brings the concept to Maine. Live Stor America is scouting for a location in southern Maine to build its first U.S. holding and distribution hub, where lobster bought from dealers in Maine would be stored in high-tech, remote monitored crates and containers until they are moved by forklifts onto trucks, train cars and cargo vessels bound for the U.S. West Coast, Europe and Asia.
The idea of shipping live lobster in tanks has been in the works for years, but never perfected, said Annie Tselikis, director of the Maine Lobster Dealers Association. French container shipping giant CMA CGM is trying to bring its version of a lobster container to market, with lobsters hand-loaded into horizontal tubes inside foam cases stacked in a container outfitted with an oxygenation and filtration system. Maersk, the largest container ship operator in the world, tried to develop a live seafood shipping container, too, even doing some test runs; but it appears to have abandoned the idea, selling off that insolvent division to creditors, documents show.
Gillis believes his technology will succeed where others have failed. Each of his containers holds almost five times as many lobsters as his competitors' containers, and far less water, which means customers will be paying to ship lobster instead of water. His containers require less direct handling of lobsters, which reduces the labor cost and stress to the lobster, he said. Chilled-out lobsters live longer and arrive healthier.
Gillis' system works like this: Lobsters are placed tail down in honeycomb-shaped plastic "girdles" inside crates that mimic the rocky burrows of the sea floor and prevent them from killing each other. The crates are stacked in irrigated, chilled shipping containers, with temperature, water level and oxygen engineered to keep lobsters docile. With the same container used for storage and shipping, the lobsters can be moved without being touched, which reduces stress, mortality and labor costs.
The system is designed so that lobsters stored in floor-level crates have exactly the same amount of oxygen, water flow and temperature as those at the top.
Gillis claims lower labor costs, the relatively cheap cost of shipping and lower mortality rates means he can ship a Canadian lobster to China for about $1 Canadian dollar a pound, or half the price of air freight. After converting to American currency, that is about the same amount, or $1.55 American dollars, that it costs local dealers to truck their lobster to Boston's Logan or New York City's LaGuardia and send them to China in the cargo hold of a commercial flight.
The other big benefit of shipping versus flying is lower mortality rates, Gillis said. Lobsters flown by plane are usually laid flat, one on top of the other, in crates packed up with ice to keep them cold, dormant and wet enough to survive the 24- to 48-hour trip from boat to plate. A Nova Scotia lobster is touched 30 times, on average, between the time it is caught and when it is cooked, Gillis said, with each touch adding to the lobster's stress. His shipping method requires just five touches.
He has yet to test his concept on the open ocean, but in road trials, with cargo containers full of lobsters on the backs of flatbed trucks headed to Texas and Florida, fewer than 1 percent of his lobsters had died after 53 days in transit. Air freight mortality rates range from 3 percent to 8 percent, depending on destination and season, according to Maine dealers interviewed for this story. Shipping trials to Europe will begin this summer.
The low mortality rate makes this storage and shipping method ideal for weak-shelled lobster such as Maine's new shells or those caught in Northumberland Strait, the warm stretch of sea sandwiched between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, which is where the crate designer fishes for lobster, Gillis said. It would allow dealers in Maine to store their product with Gillis until the price goes up.
In Maine, the bulk of the product stored and shipped probably would be lobster, which is the state's biggest export, but Gillis said they can use the same technology, storage facility and shipping methods for as many as 30 different species, including high-value Maine exports such as elvers and those that could grow their global market share, such as mussels, oysters and green crab.
Live Stor America plans to work with a local fisherman and lobster dealer to test a 3,500-pound holding system in Maine over the summer, Gillis said. Once the technology has been proved, the company plans to build a million-pound holding facility and distribution center in the Portland area, eventually hiring a half-dozen people to run that hub. He hopes to begin construction next year. Live Stor's Canadian counterpart already is building a 250,000-pound holding facility in Nova Scotia.
Even if the technology works as advertised, lobster dealers might not be quick to embrace the concept because of pricing, cash flow and insurance challenges.
In an industry such as lobster, where dock prices can change as often as two times a week, a dealer would have a hard time developing a pricing matrix for lobster that could hold for 30 days, which is how long it might take some shipments to reach Asia, said Scout Wuerthner, who manages the lobster sales division of Inland Seafood Corp., which has a facility in South Portland.
Even if both parties could agree on a price that would hold, or some range, neither would want to be the one to front the deal -- the seller wouldn't want to ship before getting paid and the buyer wouldn't want to pay for the product nine to 12 weeks in advance. That kind of extension of capital or credit just doesn't happen in the industry, said Brendan Ready, one of the founders of Ready Seafood, a live lobster shipper based in Portland.
While it may be slower than flying, the kind of ocean transit that the Live Stor network is bringing to market will not take as long as Maine dealers think it will, Gillis said. Transport from Maine to Shanghai using road, rail and sea container shipping from the U.S. West Coast can be done in less than 20 days, he said. Transport to England and Europe can be done in a week to two weeks, depending on the carrier used and the end destination, he said.
Dealers also worried about insurance. It's hard enough to insure frozen processed lobster, much less a live animal that will spend a month at sea in a box, they said.
"I don't think our customer base would be a fit for this, as prices change daily and it would be tough to convince a customer to pay a certain price and receive the lobsters nine to 12 weeks later considering prices could potentially drop," Ready said. "That being said, we shouldn't shoot down the idea. I just don't think it will fit the Maine lobster industry well, but it's exciting to see any new innovations that could maximize our resource for both customers and harvesters."
His brother, John Ready, put it this way after talking to Gillis this month: "Interesting idea, but it seemed a ways from commercialization."
Tangier Lobster, a fourth-generation live lobster exporter from Nova Scotia, has been waiting to test the CMA-designed container, called the Aquaviva, for a year, but the promised generator required to wire a test lobster container into the Tangier facility has yet to arrive. While he wants to give it a go, manager Stewart Lamont agrees that the live lobster shipping technology offered by Aquaviva is not yet workable for the lobster business model.
Lamont says Aquaviva would save him just 10 percent on shipping but take 45 days to get to Asia, as opposed to 36 hours by air.
"Why in the world would we ship by ocean unless the cost savings were incredible? That is the question that thus far we have not been able to get around," Lamont said. "CMA/CGM is terrific, but they have developed a business model without properly doing analysis for live lobster costing and without being able to carve out a profit. I think they assumed if (they) built it we would come. ... The container may perform admirably, but the business model is impossible."

Full text: There is a saying on Broadway, when a musical is bad, you come out humming the scenery.
The same can be said for terrible movies like Francis Lawrence's ("The Hunger Games") importable, Russian/American pseudo-spy thriller, "Red Sparrow." You come out humming the torture methods.
I won't waste your time as brutally as I did mine as by watching it, by giving you an entire rundown. If you haven't seen it yet and hopefully, you have not, it may well be gone soon.
I came to see if the rumors about the movie and one of my favorite actors, Jennifer Lawrence, were true. Sadly, they were. Her performance was, as they say, phoned in, and as it was in Russian, probably hacked. So sad.
Jennifer plays Dominika Egorova, a star with what I assume is the Bolshoi Ballet.
In a big opening night for her, her male dancer in a badly performed grand jeté lands squarely on Dominika's leg, fracturing it beyond successful repair.
Now, with a sick mother to care for and a Bolshoi provided apartment to hold on to, Dominika (I will heretofore refer to her as Jen, as Dominika takes to long, and I've already wasted enough time.) allows her uncle, a KGB exec, to enroll her in the exclusive and highly secretive spy school for "Red Sparrows."
Here, in a mountain school, she learns how to use her body, wet lips, smoky glances and bad English to seduce and corrupt the enemy wherever he or she is found.
In an hourlong rundown of the school's curriculum, she is guided by the Soviet "matron macabre" played by the late Charlotte Rampling. (Charlotte is still alive; she just looks like "the late Charlotte Rampling.")
Jen is raped a few times; forced to perform sexual nuances; stand nude before the stone-faced class; tortured and taught to torture, including identifying all the instruments of torture and male body parts. She learns to pick locks and eat oysters in a seductive manner.
In the course of her work in the field, she will dye her brown hair blonde and forevermore wear bangs, keep a stone-face expression and speak in seductive whispers. In fact, everyone in the movie speaks in seductive whispers, even the master torturer, who shows her an instrument that peels off a subjects skin, piece by piece.
Her first mission is, of course, that she must find and seduce the American agent (Joel Edgerton) who for some reason is allowed to walk the streets of Moscow disguised as a Russian working man. I think I got that right. It was almost impossible to follow all the instructions, not because they were in Russian, but because the sound track is so softly rendered, and the actors speak in such seductive whispers. Even the street cleaners, waiters and street car conductors speak so.
I will close by listing the really great actors who, purely for money and keeping up their Screen Actor's insurance, allowed themselves to be immersed in humiliation.
Rampling, who has seen and performed in better stuff in days past, struts around her classroom in Soviet khaki and big brown boots and seems to enjoy Jen.
OMG, is that Jeremy Irons as General Korchnoi, the maître d'hôtel of the operation? Yes it is.
Of course, he's always been open about trash work for money, and is always the very best at doing it. I forgive him, especially for the really cool tinted glasses he wears throughout.
The noted Irish actor Ciarán Hinds is here as Zakharov, who sits behind a desk for the entire film.
Scott Alexander Young appears as a Russian officer. To bad Sig Ruman is dead: he would have been awesome.
I will say Jo Willem's cinematography was superb and watching the scene changes kept me awake.
James Newton Howard is listed for music, but I could swear it sounded like Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.
As for director Francis Lawrence's pedestrian direction, it's time to go back to bows and arrows.
And to think I endured all of this because I thought I was in theater 5 to see "Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle," and was too tired to get up. Getting old is no fun.

Full text: The owner of a landmark bar and restaurant on Portland's waterfront will serve four months in jail and pay more than $1.3 million in restitution for failing to turn over most of her sales taxes to the state, and for not paying her personal and corporate Maine income taxes, over a period of seven years.
Cynthia Brown, of Portland, who owns and operates J's Oyster on Commercial Street, was sentenced Monday by Superior Court Justice Lance Walker to four years in prison with all but four months suspended, Maine Attorney General Janet Mills said in a statement Tuesday. Brown, 58, also was placed on three years' probation.
Brown, who has an 11-year-old grandson, will begin serving her sentence, most likely at the Cumberland County Jail, in two weeks.
Mills said that Brown owed Maine Revenue Services, the state tax agency, more than $1.3 million in restitution, and has repaid more than $829,000 since pleading guilty in January 2017. Brown is required, under terms of her probation, to repay the remaining $473,000.
"Maine citizens trust business owners to pay over the sales tax charged to their customers to Maine Revenue Services and to pay personal and corporate taxes on the income that they earn," said Mills, a Democratic candidate for governor. "My office will pursue individuals who abuse the trust placed in them to collect sales tax for the benefit of the people of the State of Maine. We also will strive to recover as much restitution as possible in order to make Maine taxpayers whole."
Brown, beginning in March 2008, began failing to turn over most of the sales tax she collected from restaurant patrons to Maine Revenue Services. Mills said Brown "illegally kept" the remaining funds for her own personal and business use.
"Brown then underreported the restaurant's taxable sales and sales taxes collected, which enabled Brown to steal over $800,000 in sales tax," Mills said in the statement. "She also failed to pay personal and corporate income tax during this time period."
Mills said the practice of not paying sales and income taxes to the state eventually ended in March 2015.
Brown's attorney, Tom Hallett, of Portland, said his client's willingness and ability to repay restitution to the state earned her a reduced sentence. If she had gone to trial and lost her case, Brown might have received a longer sentence -- potentially in the range of seven to 15 months.
"You always hope for no jail time, but we weren't able to do that in this," Hallett said Tuesday. "In all honesty, this was a fairly lenient sentence."
Hallett said he remains hopeful that jail officials will grant Brown work release privileges. If that were to happen, Brown could work at her restaurant during most of the day, Hallett said. She won't be eligible for work release until about one month into her sentence.
In a telephone interview Tuesday evening, Brown was asked if she had any regrets about what she did.
"Yes, 100 percent. I was in a dark place," she said. "It wasn't done with intent. I let things go drastically for a while and this is where I ended up."
During those years, Brown said, she devoted much of her time to caring for her sick husband, Lester Brown, and not enough time attending to her business affairs. He died in 2013 after a battle with cancer.
"My husband's death brought me out of my fog," Brown said.
Brown took it upon herself to repay her debts, an effort she credits her employees for helping her accomplish.
"The business has been doing so well, I've been able to pay a lot of the money back," Brown said.
J's Oyster was established in 1977. Brown took over the business in 1989 after the death of her mother, Janice Noyes.
The case was investigated by the Maine Revenue Services' Criminal Investigations Unit. Hallett, Brown's attorney, said that the matter involved only violations affecting state taxes. The Internal Revenue Service was not involved, Hallett said.

Full text: City wants to meet experts on pier project
SOUTH PORTLAND ï¿½ Local lobstermen and aquaculture operators have been invited to weigh in on the possible redevelopment of South Portlandï¿½s pier.
City officials said they see an economic opportunity at the Portland Street Pier, particularly in the field of farming shellfish like mussels and oysters. The Portland Press Herald reports a pier master plan concerning design and assessment is expected to be completed in June.
The Gulf of Maine Research Institute, which is working with South Portland on the project, said a meeting will be held March 19 with fishermen and aquaculture operators at their headquarters in Portland.
The city has owned the Portland Street Pier since the late 1800s and the pier currently operates as a seasonal fishing pier generating about $20,000 in revenue annually for the city.
Maineï¿½s US senators join school safety push
PORTLAND ï¿½ Maineï¿½s two U.S. senators are joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers to introduce legislation designed to fund school security improvements.
Independent Sen. Angus King and Republican Sen. Susan Collins say they are supporting fellow senators who want to pass the Students, Teachers and Officers Preventing School Violence Act of 2018. The legislation would also boost early intervention and prevention programs designed to curb school violence.
Collins said the proposal would help communities pay for new training and reporting systems, as well as enhance school security infrastructure. She and King say the legislation would authorize the federal Department of Justice to make grants available for the purpose of training students, school staff and law enforcement workers to identify signs of violence and intervene to stop it.
Restaurants, hotels set revenue record
PORTLAND ï¿½ Maineï¿½s hotels and restaurants set a record for revenue last year, bringing in about $3.8 billion.
The Portland Press Herald reports that tax records show lodging revenue broke $1 billion for the first time in 2017 after rising 7 percent from the year before. Restaurant revenue rose 4 percent to about $2.8 billion.
Overall, hospitality industry revenue grew about 4.7 percent, coming down from a 10-year high of 7.2 percent in 2016.
The total number of tourists visiting the state in 2017 has not been released, but a Portland-based research firm estimates the crucial summer season saw about 1 million more visitors than the year before.
School district lengthening days to combat snow day closures
BETHEL ï¿½ A school district in Maine will lengthen the school day by an hour for the next month to make up for time lost because of snow days.
David Murphy, superintendent of the Bethel-area school district, said Thursday was his districtï¿½s ninth school day of the year. WGME-TV reported that his district includes four schools and to combat the large amount of snow days, Murphyï¿½s district will be extending school days by an hour for the next 25 days.
Murphy said the district will recoup five snow days by doing this, and students wonï¿½t have to still be in school by late June.
He said the district added an hour to 25 school days last year and the plan worked well.

Full text: Fishing industry regulates scallops
ADDISON ï¿½ Maine fishing regulators are shutting down more areas to scallop fishing for the season to protect the health of the shellfish.
The state shuts down scalloping areas to prevent the valuable resource from being overfished. The Maine Department of Marine Resources says it has shut down the Harrington and Pleasant rivers, including Pleasant Bay.
The stateï¿½s also shutting down the Skillings River and Taunton Bay in the Frenchman Bay area.
The scallop fishing season begins in December and can last until early April. Most Maine scallops are harvested with drag boats, but some are taken by hand by divers. The stateï¿½s scallop fishery has steadily rebuilt in recent years after suffering a collapse in the 2000s.
The most recent closures went into place on Feb. 18.
Life-saving station gets $250k boost
KITTERY ï¿½ Proponents of the revitalization of a historic life-saving station say theyï¿½ve received a grant of $250,000 that will pay for most of the construction planned for this summer.
Wood Island Life Saving Station Association wants to turn the station into a maritime museum. Itï¿½s located on the border of Maine and New Hampshire near the entrance of the Piscataqua River.
Preservation group president Sam Reid tells the Portsmouth Herald the grant from the Thomas W. Haas Charitable Fund will help with remaining work needed at the 1908 station. It was once an outpost of the United States Life-Saving Service. It was decommissioned 70 years ago.
A local Planning Board earlier this year cast a key affirmative vote needed to restore the rescue station.

Trump proposed budget could eliminate heating aid

Full text: President Donald Trump released a proposed budget for the next fiscal year Monday that, if enacted, would have serious consequences across Maine.
The sweeping plan again proposes to eliminate the programs that provide heating oil to low-income Mainers, legal aid to indigent citizens, and grants to towns and cities to rehabilitate housing, infrastructure, and services. It also would stop federal funding for Maine Public's television and radio outlets, the University of Maine's Sea Grant research program and the Wells Reserve at Laudholm, which again would face closure.
The White House sought to eliminate all of these programs last year, but ultimately was spurned by the Republican-controlled Congress and might be again this year. The cuts last year were opposed by Maine's entire congressional delegation.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat representing Maine's 1st Congressional District, said via email that Trump's proposal "spells disaster for rural states like Maine and demonstrates how out of touch his administration is with the needs of the country." Pingree, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, added, "I'll fight the Trump administration's proposal to eliminate so many programs critical to Maine."
Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, who represents the 2nd District, said in a statement that he was pleased the budget request strengthened national security and supported the armed forces but was opposed to many of the president's proposed program eliminations, including heating assistance, public broadcasting, Sea Grant and Wells.
"As I have said before, we must make sure we maintain support for programs and agencies that serve our families and communities and help protect our environment," Poliquin said. "As Congress begins its work in the coming months on the federal budget, I will continue to push for continued support for these and other programs and agencies that do good for Maine families."
U.S. Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said via email that the budget "contains a number of concerning provisions that would roll back programs important to Maine's economy while also adding to the deficit." He said he hoped Congressional appropriators "prioritize smart spending to stimulate the economy and support people in rural Maine and across the country."
Neither U.S. Sen. Susan Collins nor Gov. Paul LePage responded to requests for comment Monday.
The White House proposal, titled "Efficient, Effective, Accountable: An American Budget," includes steep increases in military spending and funds to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, while severely reducing funding for Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and other programs.
Trump seeks to end the $3.39 billion Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating assistance to about 45,000 Mainers. His budget document states "the program is no longer a necessity as states have adopted their own policies to protect constituents against energy concerns."
The cuts also include an end to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency's Sea Grant program, which in Maine has funded groundbreaking work on how to monitor juvenile lobster populations so researchers can better predict future health of the stock; assisted mussel, scallop and kelp farmers with research and methodological expertise; developed organic certification guidelines for sea vegetable growers; and helped monitor and contain bacteria and other marine pests that plague shellfish growers and harvesters.
Sea Grant researchers created the Fishermen's Forum, the industry's premier event, in 1976, and helped found the Portland Fish Exchange, the University of Maine's Lobster Institute - which researches issues of concern to the industry - and the removal of dams and restoration of fish habitat in the Penobscot River watershed.
The budget also would eliminate funding for the Wells Reserve at Laudholm, New Hampshire's Great Bay Estuarine Reserve, and 27 other National Estuarine Research Reserves across the country.
"We have great support in our communities and states nationwide and bipartisan support in Congress," Wells reserve director Paul Dest told the Press Herald via email. "We are hopeful this will prevail again with the federal FY 19 budget when it is eventually passed."
The budget would eliminate funding for the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which provides a wide range of funds for Maine cities and towns, claiming "evaluations have been unable to demonstrate program results" and that "state and local governments are better positioned to address local community and economic development needs." In Portland, the program has been slated to fund food pantries, homeless shelters, mental health services, case work, child care subsidies for low-income single parents, a jobs program for panhandlers, community based policing and other initiatives.
At the Department of the Interior, the $13 million fund that helps compensate local communities for lost tax revenue from land included in National Wildlife Refuges also will be closed because "refuges often generate tax revenue for their communities." Maine has 11 such reserves spread across the state, from the Moosehorn reserve near Calais to the Rachel Carson reserve in Wells and Aroostook reserve in Limestone.
The budget also would eliminate the $385 million Legal Services Corporation, a Nixon-era agency that provides funding for legal aid agencies that help the poor take grievances to court.
In Maine, the agency provides $1.4 million a year to Pine Tree Legal Assistance, which is about half of its annual budget for general legal services. The 50-year-old legal aid agency, which represents poor Mainers in 4,500 cases a year, exposed and ended debtor's prison in Maine in the 1970s and one of its volunteers exposed national "robo-signing" scandal among subprime mortgage lenders.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which gets $495 million annually and distributes most of that to local public broadcasters, also would be eliminated, depriving Maine's statewide public radio and television broadcaster, Maine Public, of about $1.7 million, or 14 percent of its annual budget.
The president also seeks to end the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, which makes nearly $3 million in awards to Maine artists and cultural institutions each year, including the Maine State Museum, the Maine Historical Society, and Maine Arts Commission.
In northern Maine, the Northern Border Regional Commission also would be eliminated. The $10 million federal-state partnership has provided funding for infrastructure, land preservation, workforce training, and public services in distressed communities in the "Northern Forest region" of Maine and three other states. The closure, the budget document explains, will help encourage "states and localities to partner with the private sector to develop locally tailored solutions to community problems."

Full text: I grew up in an almost totally Caucasian town in southeastern Massachusetts. To the best of my knowledge, during my childhood, the only exception to this vast "whiteness" was a single Asian family.
This could have made me a racist. Having never personally known any persons of color, I might have deemed myself superior. Why should I associate with anyone of a different skin color? I'd be way out of my comfort zone. I wouldn't bother to learn about other cultures. Why should I care?
Or maybe, because I never was taught as a child to hate African-Americans, Asians or Latinos, or witnessed others being hateful, I'd never learn to be a racist.
Thankfully, it proved to be the latter. Too bad I can't say the same thing about our president. Though he grew up in New York City, and has basically lived there his whole life, he has secluded himself in a micro-world of white privilege.
I have felt nauseous for the past week. Anyone who judges others based on the color of their skin or where they (or their ancestors) come from sinks as low as a human being can go. I know.
You see, though my town was homogeneous racially, we weren't ethnically. We were all hyphenated, and were well aware of the ethnic origins of our surnames. As a Portuguese-American, I was at the bottom of the hierarchy, because we were the most recent arrivals.
There were cruel slang terms for every ethnic group that arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries. I call ours "the P-word," an insulting variation of "Portuguese" that I refuse to use, here or anywhere else. I worked at KFC as a teen, a job my father helped me get because he sold Arnold bread rolls to the franchise. On July 3 of this particular year, the Portuguese-American KFC manager asked me what my family was planning to do for the holiday the next day.
"We have a clam boil," I said, "but I'm not crazy about clams."
"And what self-respecting (P-word) doesn't like shellfish?"
Well, what self-respecting Portuguese uses the P-word? I duly reported this to my father, who then proceeded to tell off the manager, which could have ended both my job and his contract ... but it didn't. I think the guy was sincerely embarrassed.
Dad was sensitive to the importance of language. He had spent his early years in the city of Fall River, Massachusetts. His mother was the daughter of Québecois immigrants; his father, Portuguese by way of Brazil. He had to choose sides in the playground and street fights. Was he French or Portuguese? His Brazilian Uncle Manual had taught him how to fight. He had a Portuguese surname. He made the logical choice.
My father took after Manual, with his swarthy skin and pugnacious attitude. In the early 1950s, Dad went out to California to have a look-see. He had asthma, and his doctor thought the climate might be good for him. There, some people thought he was Mexican -- and treated him with prejudice. This was far worse than the childish ethnic skirmishes of his youth, and Dad never forgot it.
So I grew up learning that bigotry is wrong. I didn't learn how to hate. I did not want to be judged on superficialities. And
I refused to judge others in that way.
As a school librarian, I recently read a book called "Sofie's Role," by Amy Heath, to several classes of early elementary students. Sofie and her parents, as well as everyone who works at their bakery, are people of color. Their customers run the gamut of human skin tones. And here we were, in the capital of the whitest state in the union.
We discussed the book afterwards. There were many different kinds of pastries mentioned, some with foreign names. The author used expressive language. Someone in each class noted the scene in which Sofie looks out the front window and sees what she perceives as huge shapes (adults) anxious to get into the bakery to buy their Christmas Eve goodies.
Not one student noticed that all of the major characters were black. One child did mention this: "All the men who work there are wearing white, and the ladies are wearing yellow and white."
I looked back at the book. He was right.
Excellent work, young man. You should run for president some day.

'LEGACY PROBLEM' CHALLENGES PORTLAND

Full text: MAINE was in the grips of a worsening drought in the fall of 2016 when a 4-inch rainstorm delivered temporary but much-needed relief to parched streams, wells and reservoirs in the Portland area.
The storm also delivered an unhealthy punch to Casco Bay, however.
Nearly 69 million gallons of stormwater -- mixed with raw sewage, debris and polluted runoff -- flowed into Back Cove, Portland Harbor and local waterways on Oct. 21 and 22 as the storm exceeded the capacity of Portland's treatment plants. That's enough stormwater and untreated sewage to fill more than 100 Olympic-sized swimming pools which, if lined up end to end, would stretch for nearly 3 miles.
All told, Portland reported that 318.4 million gallons of combined sewage and stormwater overflowed into surrounding waters in 2016, avoiding sewer backups into homes, businesses and streets but contributing to Casco Bay pollution. Yet as recently as 30 years ago the city was discharging 1.8 billion gallons of sewage-tainted water that gushed into Portland's scenic and economically vital waterways -- an 80 percent reduction that illustrates both the strides the city has made but also the slow progress of fixing an underground infrastructure built generations before environmental regulations were created.
"This is a legacy problem. It started 100 to 150 years ago when they built the combined sewers," said Mike Riley, coordinator of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection's combined sewer overflow, or CSO, program. "It took decades to get into this problem, and it is going to take decades to get out."
Compounding those challenges, Portland and coastal cities across the U.S. are trying to fix century-old problems while facing uncertainties over future sea level rise and other effects from climate change.
"I think Portland has made a considerable amount of progress and has made a considerable amount of investment to address the issue of combined sewer overflows and the treatment of waste," said Sean Mahoney, vice president and Maine director of the Conservation Law Foundation, which sued the cities of Portland and South Portland in 1989 to force federal and state regulators to crack down on the storm-related sewage overflows.
"The health of Casco Bay was in a very different state back then than it is today, although there are certainly still issues today, as witnessed by the recent closure of clam flats because of a late algae bloom," Mahoney said.
Portland is more than halfway through what is now a roughly 40-year, nearly $250 million plan to reduce dramatically the amount of raw sewage flowing into local waterways. In addition to violating the federal Clean Water Act and state environmental regulations, those storm-related discharges carry such hidden dangers as e. Coli and salmonella that threaten the health of local residents who come in contact with the water, the vitality of Casco Bay's commercial fishing industry and Portland's status as a tourism destination.
Solving the problem isn't easy, however, and many city residents are feeling the sting during their commutes and in their wallets as the city undertakes massive infrastructure projects to reduce sewage-and-stormwater discharges into Back Cove.
Major downtown corridors -- State Street, Forest Avenue and Woodford Street, to name a few -- were torn up last year to install new separate sewer and stormwater pipelines, creating traffic hassles for months on end. A heavily trafficked stretch of State Street, for instance, was closed from August to mid-December as crews separated sewer and stormwater lines while also installing new water and gas mains. Busy Woodford Street also was torn up for much of 2017, and periodic closures of State Street Extension, Preble Street Extension and Park Avenue resulted in traffic delays and detours.
Over the next year and a half, Portland plans to install "storage conduits" under the ballfields in Back Cove Park and along the western side of Back Cove that can hold 6 million to 7 million gallons. The idea behind the massive storage tanks is to capture the first inch of storm runoff -- which contains the most contaminants, debris and other pollutants -- and later treat this "first flush" when the East End Wastewater Treatment Facility has the capacity.
City engineers originally planned to install the ballfields storage conduit under Marginal Way but reconsidered when the price tag jumped from $24 million to $32 million and after assessing the massive disruption.
"We wanted to look at alternatives that were going to reduce the business impacts, the traffic impacts and the cost while still meeting the DEP requirements," said Bradley Roland, the top engineer with the Portland Department of Public Works. "We would have basically been shutting down sections of Marginal Way for months on end."
To date, Portland has spent more than $112 million on overflow-related projects and expected to spend another $147 million on the 15-year plan adopted in 2014. Those costs are reflected in sewer and, more recently, stormwater fees that have risen more than 30 percent for the average household since 2014. Nearly 30 percent of the revenue collected by the Portland Water District from sewer bills -- which average $64.19 a month for a household -- are spent on capital and infrastructure work, including separating those legacy combined sewer-stormwater pipes hidden beneath much of old Portland.
Portland is by no means unique in facing a costly and unsightly sewage overflow problem.
Nationwide, more than 800 communities have infrastructure with combined stormwater and sewer pipes that result in discharges, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. New York Harbor alone receives an estimated 27 billion gallons of untreated stormwater and sewage annually from New York City and neighboring communities. The communities in the Boston area, meanwhile, have reduced combined sewer overflow discharges by 98 percent since the late 1980s through a $900 million infrastructure improvement plan.
In Maine, 473.6 million gallons of untreated stormwater and sewage were discharged into state waterways in 2016 by 25 communities spanning the geographic and demographic gamut from Cape Elizabeth to Calais. But Portland's 318.4 gallons accounted for 67 percent of that total as the combination of stormwater and untreated sewage was diverted passively out of more than 31 overflow sites discharging directly into surrounding waterways.
The national problem is most acute in older cities in the Northeast and the Midwest. City engineers at the time designed cutting-edge infrastructure projects around the idea that Mother Nature periodically can help flush sewers with stormwater, often into rivers or oceans that will carry the waste away. In a testament to the craftsmanship of the time, many of the brick-lined sewers laid down by workers 100 or even 150 years ago still are used today in many cities, including Portland.
Unfortunately, human waste doesn't always float. And the disease-causing bacteria found in that waste readily contaminates surrounding waters.
In 1988, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Island Institute published a report titled "Troubled Waters" that focused public attention on the issue and preceded the lawsuits against Portland and South Portland. The 78-page report, which inspired the creation of Friends of Casco Bay, said "signs of environmental degradation" in the water, sediment and marine life of Casco Bay should serve as a warning sign to the public and policymakers. While chemical pollution from industries, farms and households was part of the problem, discharges of untreated sewage and stormwater were among the largest suspected contributors.
The lawsuits filed by the Conservation Law Foundation one year later eventually led to a settlement agreement among Portland, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the DEP that laid out the city's long-term plan to address the issue.
Roland, the city's chief public works engineer, said Portland is making steady if slower-than-anticipated progress.
"If you go back to the original 30-year plan the city had, I think it is fair to say we are behind. But over the last three to four years, we have made attempts to catch up," Roland said.
The alternate plan for a 3 million-gallon storage conduit under Back Cove Park ballfields (which will be replaced) has been endorsed by the DEP, which never favored installing a storage system under Marginal Way. As a result, the department is allowing Portland to miss its original deadline for the Marginal Way project as long as the city still meets its obligations for the tanks on the western side of Back Cove.
"With Back Cove-West, if they don't meet those deadlines, we will have a problem and there will be enforcement there," said Riley, the DEP's CSO program director. "We want to see both of those tanks go in as soon as possible."
The number of combined sewer overflow discharge locations in Portland and South Portland has fallen from 60 to 36 over the past 20 years, reflecting the steady progress in both communities but particularly South Portland. The city of Portland and the Portland Water District also have spent tens of millions of dollars upgrading the capacity and efficiency of the East End Wastewater Treatment Facility.
The East End plant visible from Tukey's Bridge on Interstate 295 just north of downtown can apply the full treatment regimen (solid separation and de-watering, plus disinfection of solids and water) to 36 million gallons per day. During days of heavy flows, however, the treatment plant also can disinfect an additional 43 million gallons that cannot go through the full, multi-stage process but at least gets treated with chlorine.
Plant upgrades and "primary treatment" of up to 43 million additional gallons per day enabled the city and the Portland Water District to intercept and treat 178 million gallons of stormwater mixed with sewage in 2016 that otherwise would have flowed into Back Cove without any treatment.
"When you look at CSOs, the primary concern is with bacteria. And we are removing the bacteria," said Scott Firman, director of wastewater at the water district.
The Conservation Law Foundation's Mahoney said untreated sewage and stormwater discharges "continue to be a real problem for the health of the bay," but he said the city has done a "good job" of identifying top priorities in the next phase of work.
"The one risk is the political will to continue to address the problem," Mahoney said. "It's not easy but fortunately it is also the law. And when the political will is not there, the law is."
Back Cove seems clean today, but it is still Portland's primary catch basin.
The popular Back Cove Trail circumnavigating the estuary is dotted with more than a half-dozen green-and-white signs marking discharge locations. While probably few people stop to read them, the signs advise of "Wet Weather Sewage Discharge" and provide the bureaucratic license or permit information for that particular discharge spot.
More noticeable to many people, parts of Back Cove have taken on a greenish tinge during the past two summers. The thick mats of algae carpeting the cove and other mudflats in Portland Harbor are an alarming development, threatening to smother shellfish and deplete oxygen levels in the water.
They also signal an environmental imbalance.
Ivy Frignoca, a former Conservation Law Foundation attorney who took over as Baykeeper for Friends of Casco Bay in 2016, said it is still unclear what is causing the algae blooms, but they are "likely a combination of everything," including lawn fertilizer run-off and sewer overflows.
She credited Portland for agreeing to include the Fore River in the next phase of improvements and for adjusting its plans for the Marginal Way stormwater storage system.
"I think that kind of delay is sensible," Frignoca said. "I am supportive of it ... when their delays are thoughtful and for a reason rather than because they just didn't want to do the work."
Ultimately, the best indicator of Portland's progress is the health of the bay. And over the past several decades, the number of "no swimming" days at East End beach caused by bacterial pollution have fallen dramatically, while local shellfish flats have reopened to harvesting and Portland Harbor's commercial fishermen are enjoying healthier water and catches.
Still, Portland's 30-plus year plan would reduce the city's historic overflow discharges by only 88 percent. That means the city could face additional required upgrades if and when state or federal regulators decide that even a single gallon of sewage-contaminated stormwater is too much.
Climate change, meanwhile, presents other challenges.
In order to qualify for a loan through a state-run program, municipalities must design projects capable of withstanding a 100-year storm plus 3 feet of sea level rise. Portland's Back Cove and Marginal Way areas already flood during severe storms or astronomically high tides, forcing the city to install gates to prevent a backflow of water into discharge pipes.
Frignoca listed overflow discharges, so-called "nonpoint" nitrogen pollution from other sources and climate change as the likely top factors in recent changes -- such as algae blooms -- seen in Casco Bay.
"A lot of these questions we don't have answers to," Frignoca said, "but we know for sure that the bay is changing and changing quickly."

Full text: Thursday's blizzard pushed tidal flooding to levels not seen in four decades, and it was the third-highest in Portland since weather officials started keeping track more than 100 years ago.
Flooded buildings and piers were reported all along the Maine coast, from Kennebunkport and Wells to as far east as Machias.
John Cannon, a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, said Thursday's high tide in Portland was 13.79 feet, only slightly below the 14.17 feet reported during the infamous Blizzard of 1978. The second-highest level, 13.98 feet, also happened in 1978. Cannon said sea levels already were high because of the near-full moon, and the storm surge only made things worse.
In Portland, there was flooding on piers near J's Oyster House, on Somerset Street near Whole Foods and on Marginal Way near Diamond Street, city spokeswoman Jessica Grondin said. City officials advised motorists to turn around rather than drive through standing water.
In Scarborough, high-tide flooding made travel difficult on U.S. Route 1 near the Scarborough Marsh, on Sawyer Street near the Cape Elizabeth line, and on a private road, said Deputy Chief Marla St. Pierre, of the Scarborough police.
Andy O'Brien, a writer and former state lawmaker, posted on Twitter a photo of flooding at Lincolnville Beach near Camden, and wrote, "Never seen anything like it in my 39 years living here."
Pictures posted on social media from nearby Port Clyde showed severe flooding at the town's commercial fishing pier. In Scarborough, the Clambake Restaurant on Pine Point was flooded.
So was the Hurricane Restaurant at Dock Square in Kennebunkport.
Luanne MacDonald, who owns the restaurant, said she had prepared for possible flooding Wednesday and hoped for the best.
When she arrived Thursday, there was significant water inside the restaurant.
"I had to call the Fire Department because the water was over the (electrical) outlets and (there was) some smoking and sparking," MacDonald said.
Only a few days ago, she said, she had to close the restaurant unexpectedly because of burst pipes.
"I had already made an insurance claim for that, and now I'll have to have him come back out," she said.
MacDonald didn't know how much damage had been done but expected she'd have to replace her heating and cooling system and possibly some kitchen equipment.
Many roads were closed or blocked off throughout coastal Maine. In some areas, police kept drivers from trying to cross flooded roads.
The biggest threat of flooding was at high tide, or around 11:30 a.m. in coastal York and Cumberland counties.
"The worst is behind us," Cannon said at mid-afternoon Thursday.
The next high tide will occur after midnight, but Cannon said he didn't expect that to have a major effect because floodwater will have largely receded by then.
In the short term, the flooding was expected to erode beaches and possibly damage some coastal infrastructure, Cannon said, although it was too early to assess how widespread damage might be.
"One concern is that this could leave us more vulnerable for the rest of the winter, particularly if another extreme storm hits," he said.
About a month before the highest tide on record in Maine, in February 1978, another major storm hit. Cannon said that storm significantly weakened some protective barriers along the coast, which made the February blizzard that much more catastrophic.
"That could certainly happen again," he said.
South of Maine, many areas were experiencing high water levels as well, including Boston and coastal New Hampshire. Video footage on Facebook from a Boston television station showed a giant dumpster floating down a side street.
The National Weather Service station in Boston reported Thursday afternoon that flooding there also was approaching levels last seen in the Blizzard of '78.
"Major impacts & evacuations currently ongoing along the East Coast of Massachusetts," the weather service posted on its Twitter page.

Full text: Lobsterman Noah Ames gives away hundreds of crustaceans from back of pickup day before Christmas
THOMASTON -- No one would ever mistake Noah Ames for Santa Claus.
For one thing, the Matinicus lobsterman is rail-thin and lacks that signature bowl-full-of-jelly belly. He dresses in a sensible parka bundled up against a cold December wind, not a dashing red outfit pulled together with white trim, a black belt and boots. And Ames' vehicle of choice is a black pickup, not a sleigh, although one suspects that Santa has the edge in roof-landing ability.
Ames does most of his good works on Christmas Eve and, for dozens of midcoast families, he, like the jolly old elf, shows up once a year to give with no expectation, or desire, for anything in return.
And rather than toys, Ames gives away hundreds of crustaceans, doling them out in plastic bags from the back of the pickup rather than Santa's preferred down-the-chimney method of delivery.
Ames conducts his giveaway parked out in front of a friend's marine supply store on U.S. Route 1 in Thomaston.
A simple A-frame sign was plunked into the snow at the edge of the road Sunday: "FREE LOBSTERS TODAY for families truly in need."
One man who saw the sign late Sunday morning pulled in and cautiously walked up to the pickup truck.
"How many do you have to feed?" Ames asked.
"Me, my wife and four kids," said Freddy Ames (no relation), of Warren.
"Then you'll need a dozen," Noah Ames said, and started tossing the shellfish into a couple of bags, aided by his daughter, Nadia, 10.
He handed the bags to Freddy Ames, who said, "What a nice guy" as he turned and walked to his car with his own daughter in tow.
That's Noah Ames' approach: no other questions besides "how many?" No forms to fill out to demonstrate need. If you feel as though you need a hand this holiday, Ames is ready to extend a claw, or two. Plus the tail.
Ames' quest to give away the state's signature product started four years ago, when he felt his children could benefit from a demonstration that Christmas is more than making wish lists and tallying how the "gots" fared against the "wants" on Christmas morning.
So he set out with about a hundred pounds of lobster that he had hauled in on his boat, No Worries. Other lobstermen and dealers heard of his plan and pitched in totes of lobsters, too. After refusing all offers of money the first few years, last year he accepted donations for a local family with a young girl who has cancer. He continued that this year, as the girl is still battling the disease.
"I didn't count it, but it was quite a bit," he said of the money raised last year.
Rick Whitten said his employer, Atwood Lobster, of South Thomaston, is happy to help out with 100 pounds of the crustacean.
"It's more of a community thing," Whitten said, "and I've never seen anyone taking (undue) advantage of it."
Walter Davis, of Thomaston, said he has stopped in each year Ames has been giving away the lobsters. Davis said this year was particularly tough for him and his family, with a half-dozen relatives dying within a few months of one another.
Davis said he's particularly thankful that Ames supplied his holiday meal.
"We've had a lot of things on our minds," he said, "and Christmas dinner wasn't one of them."
On Sunday, it took Ames about an hour to give away 400 pounds of lobster. He provided 100 pounds, and the rest came from Atwood Lobster and three other lobstermen.
Ames said he knows what it's like to face hard times, from the normal boom-or-bust life of lobstering to sudden setbacks, such as the time a few months after he began the giveaway, when No Worries sank at its mooring while he was away. He managed to salvage the vessel and get back to lobstering.
But one senses that as much as he likes lobstering, the once-a-year giveaway is what keeps Ames going on those cold February mornings when he heads out to tend his traps. "Some people (who pick up lobsters) will have tears in their eyes and can't really get their arms around giving lobsters away," he said. "I want to give back to people who are struggling. It's kind of gotten bigger than me. It's a good thing -- and the kids are really into it now."

Full text: I couldn't help but notice the ads by Maine Audubon, the Sierra Club of Maine and the Natural Resources Council of Maine, all admonishing Sen. Susan Collins for voting in favor of a tax bill that was partially funded by opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. I was more than a little surprised to see no reference to climate change in any of those ads. Have we forgotten that we humans are very much a species in need of protection from the ravages of incessant fossil fuel extraction and combustion?
Deaths from heart attacks and stroke, chronic lung disease, asthma attacks, premature births, impaired brain development in infants and infant mortality have all been linked to air pollution from fossil fuels. And the carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, oil, gasoline and methane are all fueling the climate change that is causing increased sea-level rise and flooding, wildfires, extreme weather events, vector-borne diseases like Lyme and Zika, heat illness, starvation, mass migration -- and the list goes on. The Department of Defense refers to climate change as "a threat multiplier."
And of course there is the negative economic impact of climate change. The Congressional Budget Office recently released a report requested by Sen. Collins that shows that climate change is already costing us hundreds of billions of dollars, and will most surely become more expensive. That doesn't include the cost of the health effects, or consideration of some concerns specific to Maine. The lobster industry is being threatened by warming ocean waters, and the shrimp fishery is now closed for the fifth year in a row. Climate scientists predict that many ski areas in Maine will be forced to close by 2050, which would devastate the economy and property values in those areas.
It is alarming to see the conversation shifting from how to prevent climate change to how to adapt to, prepare for and retreat from its ravages, the beginnings of which we are already experiencing. In the process, we must not neglect to do something to lessen its ultimate severity --and that means keeping the fossil fuels that are causing it in the ground. Making public lands available for further exploration and extraction is harmful not just for the landscape, wildlife and local inhabitants, but for all of humanity as well.
Susan Collins has been a supporter of action to address climate change, and she was the only Republican senator to vote against opening up the Arctic Refuge to drilling in both the budget reconciliation package and the tax bill. So it was both surprising and disappointing to see her concerns regarding the refuge overridden by all the other politics around this tax bill. The fact remains that there is no issue that is more urgent or important than climate change, because of its potential for devastation. Encouraging drilling in the refuge is reflective and symbolic of our government's reluctance to acknowledge its importance. We must not allow it!
Second District Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, for that matter, has recognized that ocean acidification from carbon dioxide is a potential problem that will have a major impact on our shellfish industries. He is co-sponsoring 1st District Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree's Ocean Acidification Act, and he voted to allow the Department of Defense to spend money on climate change. In response to the president's threat to withdraw from the Paris accord, Rep. Poliquin stated that we should stay at the table on an international level to protect our planet.
A group of Republicans in the House of Representatives is asking that the Arctic Refuge drilling be removed from the tax bill. It is time for Rep. Poliquin to get on board and evolve his energy policy away from fossil fuels and join the effort.
The House and Senate tax bills have to be reconciled over the next few days. There is still time to ask both Bruce Poliquin and Susan Collins to insist that the tax cuts not be funded by fossil fuel development and that the provision for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling be removed from the bill. So, please do so -- humans and the habitat that we need in order to live and raise healthy children are ultimately at stake.

Full text: Republican elected mayor of Lewiston
LEWISTON ï¿½ Maine voters have elected Republican Shane Bouchard as the next mayor of Lewiston.
The unofficial tally Tuesday was 3,663 to 3,518, with Bouchard winning by 145 votes against Democrat Ben Chin. He will replace Mayor Bob Macdonald, who served three consecutive terms.
Bouchard overcame Chinï¿½s large lead, which had about 40 percent of the vote Nov. 7. The city held a runoff election between the two candidates after neither received a clear majority.
Bouchard told the Sun-Journal voters ï¿½realized the difference between campaign promises and actionable solutions.ï¿½
Voter turnout was lower than the previous election with the dayï¿½s weather including snow and freezing rain. Around 10,000 voted in November and 8,200 voted in the 2015 mayoral runoff.
Officials reported a turnout of about 7,186 people Tuesday.
NOAA wants to fund more fish farming
PORTLAND ï¿½ Federal marine regulators are making $450,000 available to try to foster more seafood farming on the East Coast.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said itï¿½s providing $450,000 to expand aquaculture operations and production off the eastern states. The agency said it wants to offset the U.S.ï¿½s $14 billion seafood trade deficit.
NOAA said itï¿½s looking to fund pilot projects for fish, shellfish, seaweed and other facets of the domestic aquaculture industry that it considers ï¿½newcomers.ï¿½ It also wants to help develop environmentally sustainable ocean farming.
The money will be distributed through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. NOAA also is making money available for aquaculture projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific.
Police: Officer wrestles down man in break-in
LIMINGTON ï¿½ Police say a man suspected to be under the influence of drugs broke into a Maine home, only to encounter a 6-foot-2-inch, 330-pound corrections officer.
The break-in occurred at a Limington home Tuesday afternoon.
York County police said the 35-year-old suspect told York County Jail employee Sean Wilson he was being pursued. Sheriff William King Jr. said he was sweating, bleeding from the mouth and appeared to be in ï¿½excited delirium.ï¿½
Wilson ordered him to lie on the floor. However, King says he instead began walking toward where Wilsonï¿½s two 4-year-old children were hiding.
Wilson wrestled him to the ground and held him there until officers arrived. He was taken to a hospital for observation.
King said the man ï¿½picked the wrong house to burglarize.ï¿½
Compiled from wire reports Man convicted in violent home invasion
PROVIDENCE, R.I. ï¿½ A Rhode Island man has been convicted of fatally shooting another man and gnawing part of a womanï¿½s finger off during a violent home invasion.
Twenty-seven-year-old Dari Garcia was found guilty Tuesday of first-degree murder and other offenses in Providence.
Prosecutors say the Providence man killed 27-year-old Richard Catalano in North Providence in 2014. They say that during the struggle, he also bit off part of Catalanoï¿½s motherï¿½s finger and pistol-whipped his stepfather.
Prosecutors say Garcia was found barricaded inside a room with Catalanoï¿½s body, apparently having shot himself after being abandoned by his getaway driver. They say nobody else could have killed Catalano.
Garciaï¿½s attorney accused witnesses of tailoring their testimony to the prosecutionï¿½s case. He argued discrepancies in their stories could establish reasonable doubt.
NH eyes Rainy Day Fund for opioid crisis
CONCORD, N.H. ï¿½ New Hampshire Senate Democrats want to free up about $10 million to fight the stateï¿½s opioid crisis.
Senators on Wednesday announced legislation that would allow the governor or Legislature to declare a public health emergency and tap into 10 percent of the stateï¿½s Rainy Day Fund. They criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to combat the crisis and faulted state Republicans for not putting more money in a fund for alcohol and drug treatment services.
Republican Sen. Gary Daniels says lawmakers should analyze the effectiveness of the $36 million the state is currently spending on the problem before looking to the Rainy Day Fund.
President Donald Trump declared the crisis a national public health emergency, but didnï¿½t include additional federal money.
RI aims to double grads in computer science
PROVIDENCE, R.I. ï¿½ Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo says she wants to double the number of graduates with degrees in computer science in Rhode Island by 2025.
Raimondo spoke at a computer science summit Wednesday at the University of Rhode Island.
To double the number of graduates, Raimondo wants to grow computer science programs in schools, improve the quality of computer science educators and ensure computer science opportunities are equitable by closing participating gaps.
Raimondo says nine colleges in Rhode Island produced 817 graduates in the computer science field in 2017, while more than 1,300 computing jobs were open in the state.
She says projections show there will be 2,500 computing jobs available in Rhode Island by 2020.
Raimondo says students need computer science skills to compete for high-paid jobs in growing industries.
Defense bill contains money on water study
CONCORD, N.H. ï¿½ A $700 billion defense authorization bill signed into law by President Donald Trump includes an amendment by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen to fund a nationwide health study on the implications of PFOA and related chemicals in drinking water.
The nationwide study will be conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.
Shaheen, a Democrat, said Tuesday the amendment is particularly important for families living in the Seacoast area, following the Air Forceï¿½s announcement in May that it wouldnï¿½t fund a health study of water contamination around Haven Well at the Pease International Tradeport.
The Air Force is designing a groundwater treatment system for the former military base.
Man charged in sex ring puts up $25M
GLASTONBURY, Conn. ï¿½ A Connecticut businessman charged in a sex trafficking ring has agreed to set aside $25 million to cover potential payouts resulting from civil lawsuits.
Bruce Bemer was arrested in March and charged with patronizing a trafficked person in connection with what authorities called a long-running human trafficking ring based in Danbury. Authorities say many victims were young people with mental illnesses.
Joel Faxon, an attorney for several purported victims, tells the Connecticut Post that the move ensures his clients will be financially protected as their lawsuits move forward.
The Hartford Courant reports that Bemer will also turn over all his financial data.
Bemerï¿½s attorney could not be reached for comment.
Bemer owns the New London-Waterford Speedbowl and Bemer Petroleum Corporation in Glastonbury.
Guatemalan man sentenced to 15 years in heroin conspiracy
BURLINGTON, Vt. ï¿½ A Guatemalan man has been sentenced in Vermont to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute heroin.
The U.S. attorneyï¿½s office said Wednesday that 35-year-old Diego Walther Anibal Mejia Paredes conspired with a South Londonderry, Vermont, resident to ship large quantities of heroin from Guatemala to various addresses in southeastern Vermont in 2015.
Prosecutors say customs officials discovered more than 41 kilograms of heroin in one shipment addressed to a restaurant in Manchester Center, Vermont.
Paredes has been in custody since his arrest in October 2015.
His co-defendant, Marco Antonio Lam Peralta, also pleaded guilty in August, but prosecutors say he has since filed a motion to withdraw his plea.
Teen stabbed near Massachusetts high school
LYNN, Mass. ï¿½ Police say a 16-year-old boy has been stabbed outside a Massachusetts high school and the suspect remains at large.
The boy was stabbed near the outdoor basketball courts behind Lynn English High School at about 8 p.m. Tuesday.
The victim was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston with a stab wound to the chest and is expected to survive.
The schoolï¿½s boysï¿½ basketball team was inside at the time, but itï¿½s unclear whether the victim has any affiliation with Lynn English.
Witnesses reported hearing arguing before the stabbing.
Lynn Police Lt. Dave Brown says it appears there was an altercation involving several youths who knew each other.
Sen. Warren gets second turn as comic book hero
BOSTON ï¿½ All comic book heroes need a sequel ï¿½ even U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
The Massachusetts Democrat was the focus last year of a 22-page comic titled ï¿½Female Force: Elizabeth Warrenï¿½ which told the story of Warrenï¿½s rise from Oklahoma schoolgirl to U.S. senator and champion of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.
Now the publisher TidalWave Comics is bringing out a sequel ï¿½ ï¿½Female Force: Elizabeth Warren (hash)2ï¿½ ï¿½ which chronicles the early days of Warrenï¿½s U.S. 2012 Senate campaign and her rise to power.
Instead of Batman battling the Joker, readers can follow along as Warren battles Congress to ease the burden of crushing student loan debt.
Past subjects of the ï¿½Female Forceï¿½ series include Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Condoleezza Rice, Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and Nancy Pelosi.
Labor panel rules against Harvard in student union dispute
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. ï¿½ A federal panel has ruled against Harvard University in a dispute over a 2016 election to decide if graduate students would form a union.
The National Labor Relations Board on Tuesday denied Harvardï¿½s appeal of an earlier decision that nullified the results of a 2016 election and called for a new vote.
Harvard officials did not immediately comment.
Results of the November 2016 election were voided by a regional labor panel that concluded Harvard published an incomplete list of students who were eligible to vote.
An initial count had found that students voted against unionizing, but 300 ballots were challenged and werenï¿½t counted.
The national boardï¿½s decision paves the way for a new vote.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union applauded the decision and said members are focused on organizing students.
Woman who grabbed Wintrich notes appears in court
ROCKVILLE, Conn. ï¿½ A Connecticut woman has made her first court appearance after being charged with attempting to steal the notes of right-wing commentator Lucian Wintrich during his appearance last month at the University of Connecticut.
Catherine Gregory, of Willimantic, is charged with attempted sixth-degree larceny and disorderly conduct after taking papers from a lectern as the Gateway Pundit writer prepared to give a speech titled ï¿½Itï¿½s OK To Be White.ï¿½
Wintrich was originally charged with breach of peace after grabbing Gregory in an attempt to retrieve the notes. Those charges were dropped this week.
Gregory did not enter a plea Wednesday and her case was continued to January 9. Outside the courthouse, Gregory thanked people for what she called ï¿½their support and solidarity in the struggle against racism and fascism.ï¿½
Police: Swastikas found carved into high school desk
ANDOVER, Mass. ï¿½ Massachusetts police say three swastikas were found carved into a desk inside a high school on the first day of Hanukkah.
Andover High School Principal Philip Conrad announced Tuesday that the school will be working with police, local faith leaders and the Anti-Defamation League of New England to denounce the hateful graffiti. The Eagle-Tribune reports this is not the first time the school has dealt with swastika graffiti, as there have been several incidents this year.
Police Lt. Edward Guy called the graffiti disturbing and unacceptable, noting that drawing swastikas is a hate crime.
Andover High officials contacted the Anti-Defamation League on Tuesday to discuss response strategies.

Early days of sea duck hunting provided new frontier

Full text: Duck hunting in general has changed a lot over my lifetime, from hand-carved wooden blocks to mass-produced plastic decoys, from lead shot to steel and other non-toxic alloys, and from waxed cotton coats to windproof and waterproof breathable laminate apparel.
But I don't think any specific subset of the sport has changed more than sea duck hunting.
When I started hunting what the locals referred to as coots, it was a largely underused resource. The upside was nearly nonexistent competition. The downside was a profound paucity of proper equipment and adequate advice. Fortunately, my mates and I had a pretty solid handle on the basics of puddle duck hunting. How different could it be?
Duck hunting clothes, in those days, consisted largely of military surplus wool-lined cotton overalls and coats, in olive drab, tan or dark navy blue, and black rubber hip boots. The only camouflage pattern available was the one designed by Uncle Sam, but you didn't need it for the naive sea ducks.
Our standard puddle duck guns and loads would suffice, but decoys proved a bit more problematic at first. After searching the Herter's catalog, we learned that commercial sea duck decoys were virtually nonexistent. The few coot shooters around at the time either paid a small king's ransom for custom-made cedar or cork blocks, or simply spray painted Chlorox jugs black. So my first string of eider decoys came from my mother's laundry room.
Next, we needed a boat. I called in a favor and was able to borrow a 20-foot white oyster skiff. The centrally located cleaning table made a good place to transport decoys and other gear, and served as a functional seat. The birds didn't seem to mind the pure white hull, but the 12-foot mast did hinder our wingshooting at times.
But it wasn't much of a problem, because the gunning was like nothing we'd experienced before.
Shooting started at first light as rafts of hundreds, sometimes thousands of eiders and scoters dispersed up into the bays and channels to feed on expansive and at the time unexploited mussel beds. The gunning was nearly nonstop until all had reached their seven-bird bag limit, which didn't take long, regardless of how many gunners were in the group.
That presented another problem, the solutions to which illustrated that big changes were already under way. After quickly burning through the paper-hulled shotshells my father had given me, I had to buy some of those "modern" plastic hulled ones, an expense that ultimately prompted me to reload my own shotshells. And more enhancements were on the way.
The 23/4-inch shells we shot proved barely adequate and so were quickly replaced with 3-inch versions, once those became readily available. That, in turn, required new guns chambered to handle the longer, more powerful loads, so my old Lefever Nitro Special side-by-side was replaced with a brand new Ithaca autoloader. While we were a century too late for the golden age of waterfowling, we were witnessing the dawn of sea duck hunting's heyday.
Over the next two decades, the sport's popularity skyrocketed. Several things contributed, including inland waterfowlers increasingly frustrated with fewer ducks, tighter bag limits and more competition, enterprising nimrods seeking new and different challenges, and folks drawn by tales of typically fast and furious shooting.
Filling a daily bag limit of seven birds was seldom a problem, regardless of how many hunters were present. You could easily burn up a couple boxes of shotshells in a single morning. The resource seemed virtually unlimited and a new guiding industry popped up. But still more change was on the way.
It began subtly. Wildlife agencies began noticing declining duck numbers. Following their suggestions of voluntary restraint, some of us ceased shooting hens and increasingly stopped short of filling our daily bag.
It wasn't enough, and further declining numbers prompted tighter bag limits. Meanwhile, recovering puddle duck numbers and a boom in resident geese lured more wader wearers back inland.
Jump ahead a couple more decades to the present, and it's a very different scenario. Winter aggregations of birds have dwindled from tens of thousands to thousands, in some places from thousands to hundreds, and in others have declined from hundreds to dozens. Bag limits have been reduced and reduced again, and seasons shortened.
Still, the tradition remains alive, albeit quite differently. Though fewer in numbers, hunters still brave the briny. Their cotton duck clothing has been replaced with high-performance apparel designed to withstand the worst conditions and adorned with the latest designer camo patterns. Their Italian autoloaders shoot 31/2-inch loads of tungsten or bismuth shot over strings of high-density polyurethane production decoys. Full bag limits are far less common, and there are fewer locals and more guided nonresidents hoping to bag their bucket list bull eider. But all look forward to the coming days when the daily average temperatures drop and the offshore gunning starts to heat up.

Full text: A rare late-season toxic algae bloom has closed most of the fertile shellfishing areas in Casco Bay, disrupting the region's wild-caught and farmed shellfish industry.
The Department of Marine Resources expanded the area of the harvesting ban Tuesday so that it now stretches from Portland Harbor to the west side of Harpswell. The closure was triggered when tests of shellfish flesh showed elevated levels of domoic acid, a naturally occurring toxin that can produce sickness and brain damage in humans.
The ban affects hundreds of acres of productive clam flats in Freeport and Brunswick and at least a dozen mussel and oyster farms in those towns and around Chebeague Island. There were about 179 licensed clammers in Casco Bay in 2016, but 45 were in Harpswell, which has not been as affected by the closures. The number of full-time clammers is much lower than the total number of licensees. Almost all people who are clamming at this time of year are full-time, not recreational or seasonal, fishermen.
The domoic acid is being produced by a large phytoplankton bloom that includes species of Pseudo-nitzschia, the same kind of single-cell organism that closed large sections of the Down East coast to harvesting and forced shellfish recalls in the past two years.
This is the first recorded bloom of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia in Casco Bay.
Certain Pseudo-nitzschia species produce domoic acid, which can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, resulting in nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, short-term memory loss and seizures. The only recorded case of domoic acid poisoning occurred in Prince Edward Island in 1987, when three people died and more than 100 became ill after eating tainted blue mussels.
Having a bloom in this part of Maine so late in the season surprised state monitors, said Kohl Kanwit, director of the department's public health bureau.
"We thought we were done. We haven't seen Pseudo-nitzschia blooms resurge like this. It is really late in the season," Kanwit said. A volunteer on Chebeague Island first detected high concentrations of phytoplankton on Sunday, indicating an algae bloom.
A precautionary closure in the area was enacted Monday, after low-levels of domoic acid were found in a shellfish sample taken from an aquaculture site in the middle of the bay. It was expanded Tuesday after testing showed sharply elevated levels of the toxin in Freeport shellfish. That sample had domoic acid levels of 17 parts per million, uncomfortably close to the 20 parts per million action level, above which federal law mandates closures and recalls, Kanwit said.
"All through Casco Bay there are visible detection levels," Kanwit said. "We caught it in time. It is one of those things. It can happen so fast."
The closure will remain in place until phytoplankton levels decline, Kanwit said. In reaction to recent unpredictable Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, the state revised its monitoring protocol to allow snap closures at the first sign of toxin levels.
Aquaculture owners still will be able to harvest and sell product as long as it is screened for toxins before it goes on the market, Kanwit said.
"There are always people who depend on this for their living. We try our best to carve out areas that aren't being impacted. Sometimes it is unavoidable to have larger closures."
Eric Horne, who works at least 15 acres of oyster farms in Freeport, periodically deals with temporary closures because of storm runoff, but he said a biotoxin closure is an unfamiliar challenge.
"Any interruption to the flow of product is problematic for sure," Horne said. "This is a busy time for people in the shellfish industry."
Some wild harvesters don't have the luxury of specific testing and will have to wait until the state lifts its harvesting ban.
In 2015, clammers in Freeport, Yarmouth, Brunswick and Harpswell pulled in 822,287 pounds of soft-shell clams worth $2.1 million, roughly 9 percent of the statewide harvest value. Last year, Maine's softshell clam harvest was worth $15.6 million, according to state records.
About a dozen Brunswick clammers were digging in Middle and Maquoit bays before the closure was put in place, said Dan Devereaux, the town's marine resources officer.
While it hurts to lose access to highly productive areas in the two bays, Brunswick clammers can still work flats on the New Meadows River on the east side of town, at least for the moment, Devereaux said.
"The closure could expand in another day. We don't know," he said.
"This is the stuff we are going to deal with now because the environment has changed."
Chad Coffin, a Freeport clammer, said this type of biotoxin is unfamiliar and the approximately dozen clammers in town don't know what to expect.
"I don't have anything to compare it to," Coffin said. Unlike the phytoplankton that causes regular red tide blooms in Maine during the spring and summer, cold water doesn't seem to bother Pseudo-nitzschia, Coffin said. The water in Freeport was 48 degrees Wednesday, he added.
"Obviously it is concerning that the water is this cold and this stuff is apparently thriving or at least moving to the level of concern for public health."

Don't repeal Clean Power Plan

Full text: President Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, appears set on repealing the Clean Power Plan, America's only federal limit on carbon emissions from existing power plants.
By law, the EPA must solicit public input, but by holding just one hearing -- on a Tuesday and Wednesday, in the heart of coal country (West Virginia) -- Pruitt seeks to minimize public transparency and boost industry influence over the process.
The Clean Power Plan was adopted by the EPA under then-President Barack Obama only after hearings across the country gave all concerned a voice in shaping a policy to reduce the carbon emissions that are disrupting our weather, damaging our coasts and maritime industries and making the ocean more acidic.
Pruitt is attempting to reverse that policy, as quietly as possible, to support the fossil fuel industry he served before being appointed to his current position.
Maine and other Northeastern states pay a high price for carbon dioxide from power plants to our west. The chemistry is simple: Carbon dioxide plus water yields carbonic acid. A warmer, more acidic ocean endangers shellfish, lobster and other fisheries. More frequent, intense storms and rising sea levels lead to more power outages, flooding and costly damage to roads and buildings.
The Clean Power Plan followed the lead of the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Maine has enjoyed substantial benefits from the pact. Over $60 million from the RGGI sale of carbon credits has been used to provide energy-efficient solutions for homes and businesses. Because of the RGGI, we have more clean-energy jobs in Maine and have paid less money to international fossil fuel corporations. Perhaps that's why New Jersey is poised to return to the RGGI and Virginia is expected to join it: They recognize its value.
Maine will be allowed to meet the federal Clean Power Plan standards by continuing the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which had already set power plant carbon limits before the Clean Power Plan took effect. But the ocean and Maine's fisheries and other maritime activities are profoundly affected by emissions from states that are not part of the RGGI. Warming ocean temperatures, increasing acidification and rising sea levels are a destructive combination. On the Atlantic coast, according to government scientists, sea-level rise will have the greatest negative social impact in three areas: Maine, the Chesapeake Bay and Florida.
Maine's fishing community is already feeling the impacts of climate change. The Gulf of Maine is warming 99 percent faster than the rest of our Earth's oceans. Maine lobstermen, commercial fishermen and clammers are concerned about the impact that warming waters, ocean acidification and the arrival of invasive species have on their businesses and livelihood. We're also expecting another season with shrimp fishing closed in the Gulf of Maine.
As the Gulf of Maine warms up, cod are moving north to colder water. This mainstay of the Gulf of Maine economy for centuries may not be saved by fishing regulations, no matter how strict. Menhaden, herring, hake and northern shrimp populations are dangerously depleted. Sea life we're not used to in the Gulf, like blue crabs, black sea bass and longfin squid, are turning up in fishermen's nets. More invasive species like green crabs are devastating clam flats. Lobster abundance in southern New England has declined by more than 70 percent because of rising ocean temperatures.
Ocean acidification may have less visible but still serious consequences. For more than 50 years, atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa in Hawaii has shown steady annual increases. Since the early 1990s, when tests of surface seawater began in the same area, its acidity has been increasing with a parallel regularity to atmospheric carbon dioxide. In Congress I wrote a bill, often cited as FOAREM (the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act), to establish our country's first program to improve understanding of the risks of ocean acidification to our fisheries and coastal communities. The idea was only incorporated in law several weeks after I had left the House and Barack Obama had taken office as president.
Warming ocean water, increasing acidity and rising sea levels will have a significant adverse effect on Maine's culture and economy unless we act. All of us tied to the Gulf of Maine by location or employment have a vital stake in the EPA proceedings designed to do away with the Clean Power Plan. We need to stand up and speak out against the Trump administration's attempt to eliminate it.

Loss of Maine shrimp deprives chefs, clam shacks of delicacy

Full text: There have been times -- boom times -- when Maine shrimp was so plentiful, it was taken for granted.
Rick Frantz, owner of Andy's Old Port Pub on Commercial Street in Portland, recalls going to Boothbay with his girlfriend in the late 1960s and buying Maine shrimp by the barrelful. For poor college kids, it was a cheap source of protein.
"It was very, very inexpensive," he said. "We'd take it back to the fraternity and boil it."
Fifty years later, the Maine shrimp season has become a casualty of warming waters because of climate change and, consequently, strict regulations. On Wednesday, regional fisheries managers voted to extend a moratorium on shrimping in northern New England through the 2018 season, which traditionally runs from December to April. For the fifth year in a row, the sweet little morsels probably won't appear on Maine restaurant menus. At a time when chefs are more focused than ever on local ingredients, what will they do without these winter delicacies -- especially when it looks as if they might never come back?
Shellfish distributors who sell to Maine restaurants say chefs are searching out alternatives to satisfy diners' appetites for Maine shrimp. Frantz, like many others, now substitutes Canadian shrimp, which are the same species but a genetically distinct population. At his Andy's Old Port Pub, they are deep-fried to use in po' boys and salads, served as appetizers, and piled onto plates for shrimp dinners.
"They seem to be a pretty good substitute," Frantz said. "We don't push them as hard, only because we would rather push something that is from our own (fishermen)."
Other chefs are using farmed shrimp from around the globe (Maine has no commercially available farm-raised shrimp), or shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico that is similar in size to Maine shrimp, but white instead of pink. The fussiest are dipping into a small supply of Maine shrimp from a limited (and pricey) fishery designed to aid research. And some chefs have taken shrimp off their menus altogether.
Ross Carroll, general manager at Maine Maritime Products in Belfast, says the classic fry shacks that go through 15,000 to 20,000 pounds of shrimp a year are using the Canadian shrimp, and "most people won't even know the difference." Most other restaurants, he said, are flocking to 70-to-90 count (meaning 70 to 90 shrimp in 1 pound) farm-raised shrimp from Southeast Asia. That shrimp, farmed in places such as Thailand and Vietnam, is larger than Maine shrimp, but they are half the price of Canadian shrimp and come peeled, deveined and individually frozen so cooks don't have to thaw a huge block of them at once.
"It's a more consistent supply that will never go away," Carroll said. "It's not so volatile like the wild shrimp."
Wild northern shrimp are light pink and prized for their sweet taste and delicate texture. They cook fast; add them to a bowl of hot broth, and they'll be done by the time the bowl is carried to the table. The species, Pandalus borealis, is found in the Arctic, north Atlantic, and north Pacific oceans. In the North Atlantic, Maine is at the southern edge of the species' range. The shrimp are temperature-sensitive, and as climate change warms the waters of the Gulf of Maine, they are struggling -- either not surviving, or not reproducing, according to Margaret Hunter, a Maine Department of Marine Resources scientist with the northern shrimp program.
Gone are the days of fishermen selling cheap Maine shrimp by the side of the road, or families buying them a couple hundred pounds at a time, as Carroll's grandfather did, then blanching and freezing them for budget-friendly meals.
"Maine shrimp was a staple for a long time," said George Parr, owner of Upstream Trucking, which sells seafood to lots of Portland-area restaurants. "People would buy 50 pounds of whole shrimp to take home and sit in the corner and peel them and freeze them."
Like Carroll, Parr has seen his regular customers switch to farmed shrimp. "They went to farmed shrimp because you can't get wild shrimp" from other parts of the globe such as South America and Mexico, he said.
"They don't bother fishing wild shrimp that small because they can't get any money from them. ... Even Canada is not putting out that much product."
This coming year, those chefs who have relied on "test shrimp" -- caught in the Gulf of Maine and sold by some fishermen to support research into the decline of the shrimp population -- might be out of luck. Last year, that catch was limited by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to 53 metric tons, and fishermen were able to land only 32 tons. Next year's "research set-aside" catch of Maine shrimp has been drastically reduced to just 13.3 metric tons, but Commissioner Patrick Keliher of the Maine Department of Marine Resources has said Maine will not participate in the research harvest at all.

You can't go wrong with whiskey, oysters at King Eider's Pub

Full text: On a cold, blustery November day, a glass of whiskey or a boozy hot coffee is just what the doctor ordered.
Perhaps for liability purposes I should state that I am not a doctor, but I've had my fair share of whiskey and can attest to its healing powers.
King Eider's pub is a haven for anyone who wants to drink like the Irish do. It is nestled right in the center of Damariscotta's main strip, and there are three separate areas to drink (or dine) in.
The ground level houses the pub. Brick walls surround you, locals' handmade mugs hang from iron hooks on the beams of the ceiling for those regulars who wish to have their own drinking vessels ready to rock, and cherry floors complete the warm feel. You can also climb the stairs to the oyster bar where delicious local oysters come in many different forms. Or venture a bit higher upstairs to the dining area, offering a slightly quieter atmosphere. Wherever you decide to nestle in for the day, each area of King Eider's has the full menu available.
Despite traveling up there for a drink in the cold off-season, it was rather busy. But with the three dining areas, my party didn't have to wait too long for a booth to open up. To start, I ordered the King Eider Coffee ($9) to warm myself up. They have several alcoholic coffee drinks to choose from, but I had to go with the one that was named after the pub. What better way to get a feel for what it's all about? It consisted of Tia Maria (coffee liqueur), dark crème de cacao and Grand Marnier, of course, topped with whipped cream.
I'll admit that Grand Marnier had me skeptical. Orange flavored liqueur in coffee? But it blended surprising well, and the light citrus added a nice acidity and balanced out the Tia Maria. Lots of bars offer versions of Irish coffees. It runs the risk of becoming boring and, more often than not, is far too sweet. It's such an easy drink to make, I've found that many bars phone it in. But it was clear that King Eider's took pride in this concoction and created a well-balanced, non-diabetes-inducing hot beverage.
Next, we went a little wild with the whiskey and bourbon tastings (and thank goodness we had a designated driver with us). The first one we tried was the Wiggly Bridge Baby Bourbon ($11). Distilled down in York, I had to give this a try, and I have to say, it's extremely well done. It was so smooth and went down easily with no burn at all.
Next up was the W.L. Weller Antique 107 ($12). Apparently, this is considered a rare and collectible bottle, according to the menu. It was a richer, darker amber color than the other whiskeys and had an amazing charred-wood smokiness to it. I had to make sure I hadn't sprouted hair on my chest after the first sip. Despite its bold flavor, it also managed to maintain that token bourbon sweetness. Lastly, we tried the Highland Park 12 Year ($11) - also delicious, but not nearly as strong a whiskey as the Weller Antique. Ideally, we should have started the tasting with the Highland Park. It was a more mellow drink, with notes of honey and cedar.
Lastly, we couldn't leave without at least trying one of the oyster dishes. The Damariscotta River boasts some of the world's best oysters, and with so many different options available, from raw to Oysters Rockefeller to skillet-roasted, we asked our server for her opinion. We were told to try the BBQ Bacon Oysters ($19). Yes, you heard that right. For the second time that afternoon, I was highly skeptical. It sounded like a crime against oysters. But the dish came out, and it was spectacular. Easily the best cooked-oyster dish I've ever had. They're baked right in the shell and drowned in barbecue sauce with large, meaty cuts of bacon. The squeeze of lemon made them even better. Even now, as I write this, remembering back on them, my mouth is watering.
All in all, King Eider's Pub is concocting fresh, inspired recipes and cocktails. Whoever created its unique menu deserves high praise. It's obvious why there's always a crowd at this historic little pub. With its massive, creative drink list - everything from craft cocktails to local beers, bourbons and wine - there wasn't a single thing we tried that wasn't delicious. My only regret has nothing to do with them, only that the King Eider's Coffee doesn't pair well with BBQ Bacon Oysters.

Acidity threat warrants strong state response

Full text: In 2014, with rising ocean acidity threatening Maine's fishing and aquaculture industries, a state commission issued a series of recommendations for localized research that was delivered with optimism.
"While scientific research on the effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems and individual organisms is still in its infancy," the report said, "Maine's coastal communities need not wait for a global solution to address a locally exacerbated problem that is compromising their marine environment."
Three years later, little progress has been made on those recommendations, and the work in implementing them has been left to volunteers -- hardly the response warranted by such a threat to Maine's marine economy.
Contrast that with actions in Washington state, which commissioned its own blue-ribbon panel on acidification in 2012. Looking to protect its $270 million-a-year shellfish industry, Washington has since used $6 million in public money to fund research into ocean acidification, and is a founding member of a coalition working on the issue that includes four states, two Canadian provinces and nine national governments.
But not Maine, home of a shellfish industry with more than twice the value of Washington's.
Here, efforts to put public resources toward monitoring and researching ocean acidification have come up short, and last year the commission was disbanded. The commission's work has been taken up by a group of volunteers who now must find their own funding sources, and get by without the significant power of the state behind them.
This isn't something Maine should be doing on the cheap. Fueled by rising temperature and increased runoff from coastal development, ocean acidity has increased 30 percent since the Industrial Revolution, and the ocean is expected to be two or three times more acidic than today by 2100.
The acidity makes it more difficult for mussels, oysters and clams to build shells, meaning fewer infants survive until adulthood. It has caused failures at oyster hatcheries and mussel farms, and some high-acidity flats in Maine are no longer producing clams.
"Make no mistake about it: What is at risk here is nothing short of the future of the aquaculture and fishing sectors of this state," Maine Aquaculture Association executive director Sebastian Belle told state legislators in 2015.
The research on how acidity effects lobsters in cold water, however, is limited, an information gap that the largely forgotten report from the state commission was designed to close.
Without research conducted along the Maine coast, we won't know how lobsters are responding to ocean acidity at different ages and in different areas. We won't be able to identify areas of the state most affected by runoff and formulate ways to mitigate that impact. We won't be able to move fishermen away from troubled spots, or properly prepare for major changes in an industry that defines communities up and down the coast.
The volunteer group is doing some of that work on their own, even traveling to an overseas conference on the subject. They are discussing joining the group founded by Washington state and others. Members say they have had cooperations from state agencies.
But with so much at stake, that's simply not enough. As it stands now, Maine's marine economy is heading into the next century blind.

Full text: At last week's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Germany, an issue of vital importance to Maine fishermen and shellfish growers took the international spotlight: the increasing acidity of the sea, which is making it harder for some shellfish to grow their shells.
The governors of Washington state and Oregon joined the fisheries minister of Fiji, the meeting's official host nation, to announce the expansion of a year-old international alliance to combat the problem. It now includes four states, two Canadian provinces and nine national governments.
Maine isn't one of them, nor was anyone from Maine state government at the conference.
Nearly three years ago, a bipartisan panel of experts convened by the Legislature concluded that ocean acidification -- a byproduct of global warming -- represented a potentially catastrophic threat to Maine's marine harvesters, and it issued a series of recommendations for Maine policymakers to enact, many of them focused on closing the information gap about the threat.
But state government and legislators have done little to implement the panel's recommendations. A Republican-sponsored bill to put a $3 million bond issue on the ballot that would have funded targeted data collection, monitoring, and assessments of the effect on wildlife and commercial fish species never got a floor vote, while lawmakers last year declined to endorse allowing the 16-member panel to continue its work.
"For a state whose identity and economy is so heavily dependent on marine resources, I think it is really shameful that we are not doing enough to look at the threats of changing ocean chemistry," said Bill Mook, founder of Mook Sea Farm, who had to develop water treatment systems after watching acidic water kill crop after crop of newly hatched oysters. "I think it's really abdicating responsibility by the leaders of the state."
Instead, leadership has fallen to a volunteer group of Maine scientists and conservationists who, without state funding, are trying to coordinate the expansion of a monitoring system, apply for grants to fund research and participate in meetings with colleagues from other parts of the world working on the issue.
"This is a volunteer partnership with no money, but this bottom-up, 'let's do it together and see what we can get done' is kind of a Maine story," said Aaron Strong, an assistant professor in marine policy at the University of Maine who sits on the ad hoc group's steering committee and attended Monday's international ocean alliance event in Bonn, Germany. "We're making substantive progress on all the recommendations."
Rep. Mick Devin, D-Newcastle, co-chaired the ocean acidification panel and is participating in the volunteer body that's replaced it, but he said it is no substitute for official action. "We don't have the weight of the state government bearing on the ocean acidification problem," he said. 'When the Legislature establishes policy for the state, it's there. It's concrete. But when we're forced to do it with volunteers and on a shoestring budget, it isn't."
Acidification, driven by increased carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and freshwater runoff from extreme rainfall in river basins, has been implicated in failures at oyster hatcheries and mussel farms and has been shown to weaken clams and other shell-building animals vital to Maine's fishing and aquaculture industries. Nearly 90 percent of the value of Maine's commercial fish catch comes from such creatures.
Researchers in the Gulf of Maine have documented that free-floating softshell clam larvae avoid burrowing into more acidic mud, which means they spend more time exposed to predators as they seek appropriate habitat; that acidic water conditions stunt clam growth; and that baby oysters have so much trouble building their first shells in acid conditions they often die before they're completed. The effects on lobster -- far and away Maine's most valuable fishery, with a landed value of $630 million last year -- remain unclear pending additional research.
"This is an issue that's not going to go away and that we need to understand," said Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, who told legislators two years ago that the future of his industry was at stake.
With the official ocean acidification panel disbanded and the Legislature declining to endorse a bond to fund monitoring, many members of the panel decided to convene on a voluntary basis to keep momentum going. Members of the group, the Maine Ocean and Coastal Acidification Partnership, have added ocean chemistry monitoring sites in Casco Bay, agreed among themselves what the priority research projects are to find funding for, and hold public meetings and seminars.
"The disadvantage is that it doesn't have the obvious public stamp of approval of being approved by the state, but we do have participation from the state agencies," said Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at the Rockland-based Island Institute who is one of the leaders of the effort. "There wasn't a lot of support from the state to have the departments participate mandatorily, but they have been coming on a voluntary basis, which we've found is a really successful way for them to be involved."
Rep. Devin puts blame for inaction squarely on the governor. "It's the governor and a few of his minions that have blocked the ocean acidification bills," he said. "We're not going to be able to do anything environmental with Governor LePage in office."
Peter Steele, a spokesman for Gov. Paul LePage, would not provide a statement on the administration's position and reasoning on the issue, forwarding instead a copy of former Environmental Protection Commissioner Patricia Aho's 2015 legislative testimony opposing the continued operation of the ocean acidification panel on the grounds that existing efforts were sufficient.
Unable to secure funds for monitoring and research, Devin said he personally made sure the wording of the $50 million research and development bond put forward to and approved by voters in June allowed applications for this purpose. University of Maine researchers are preparing an application for the associated grant competition administered by the Maine Technology Institute.
"I counted this as a victory, given who the governor is," Devin said bluntly.
The situation has parallels on the federal level, according to U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, the Democrat representing Maine's 1st District, who has been trying for two years to pass a bill that would direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the likely effects of acidification on coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge. It has four Republican co-sponsors -- 2nd District Rep. Bruce Poliquin is not one of them -- but faces slim prospects on Capitol Hill.
"There's always a chance the Republicans will take it up, but the committee chair is particularly resistant to anything related to climate change," said Pingree, referring to Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, the panel that would review the bill.
The stakes for Maine, she said, are high. "We not only have an economic dependence on fisheries, but we have a very strong cultural dependence on fisheries; and because ocean acidification concentrates its impacts on the shellfish industry and we don't know very much about it, it is very critical that we do more research and that we prepare for it."
The White House, for its part, is seeking to eliminate many of the programs that fund key members of Maine's volunteer ocean acidification committee, including those supporting the University of Maine Sea Grant program (whose website hosts its activities), the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership (which maintains many of the monitoring devices), and the Wells Reserve (which maintains another). However, neither chamber of the Republican-controlled Congress appears interested in cutting these programs, according to current versions of their 2018 budget bills and reports.
President Donald Trump also announced he will pull out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and the United States is now the only U.N. member state that is opposed to the international effort to reduce voluntarily the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.
Some coastal states have taken a much more proactive approach to the issue.
Washington state, worried about the threat to its own $270 million shellfish industry, convened a blue-ribbon panel whose November 2012 findings helped inform the Maine commission's study. The state, which has had a divided Legislature, has since passed bills creating and providing some $6 million to a special research institute at the University of Washington dedicated to studying the problem. It also created a permanent standing committee to coordinate the effort and joined California, Oregon and British Columbia in creating a regionwide coalition to confront the issue.
"The university has been doing forecasting work to predict like a weather forecast where the most corrosive waters are going to be occurring," Julie Horowitz, senior policy adviser to Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, said via telephone from Bonn, where she and her boss were attending the U.N. conference. "If you're a shellfish grower, the idea is to be able to say: 'Here's the forecast for the next day or week.'"
Their regional alliance has since gone global. In Bonn on Monday, an international network it founded welcomed Fiji and Sweden as members and Inslee called on world leaders to take bold action on the issue. "We need a strong coalition talking about the need for global carbon emissions reductions to address ocean acidification," Horowitz explained. "It's vitally important to elevate ocean issues on the U.N. Conference of Parties' agenda, and we need all the help from each other to get to that."
The volunteer Maine group has been conferring with California, Washington and other governments in the regional alliance, had representatives in Bonn, and is hoping to join the international alliance as an affiliate member, alongside other nonprofits, universities and companies concerned about the issue. "Being able to work directly with the folks who are working hard on this in other states and countries, that was the most meaningful part of my experience here," Strong of the University of Maine said of his attendance in Bonn. "It's great to have Maine have a little taste of being part of the world stage."

Full text: Explanation for toxic algae bloom unclear
No one knows where an algae bloom that closed hundreds of miles of coastline to shellfish harvesting this fall came from. Or why the microscopic phytoplankton responsible for it suddenly became so bountiful in the Gulf of Maine. Or even why it produces toxins in the first place.
What is known is that a toxic bloom of pseudo-nitzschia, a common phytoplankton, caused a recall of 58,500 pounds of blue mussels in September -- only the second shellfish recall in Maine's modern history.
To prevent another recall, the state is drastically reassessing its shellfish monitoring practices.
"I'm frustrated we had another recall this year," said Kohl Kanwit, director of public health for the Maine Department of Marine Resources. A similar pseudo-nitzschia bloom in 2016 forced a recall and closed a third of the state's 3,500-mile coastline to harvesting.
"I was confident we were going to be ahead of it. We knew a lot more, we were quicker to react to it, but we weren't accounting for the fact that in less than a week toxins could go from barely detectable to over the (safety) limit."
Next year, even a hint of toxic pseudo-nitzschia in the water will trigger broad precautionary closures until the department knows shellfish are safe, an entirely new approach to biotoxin management, Kanwit said.
"Usually you have plenty of time," she said. "Now, going forward into next year, the minute we start to see toxins we will start to take action. We won't wait to see what the next week's scores are, we will close down flats."
On Wednesday, the state lifted a harvesting ban on a section of coastline east of Milbridge after toxin levels declined to safe levels. It was the last part of coast to reopen since elevated toxin levels were detected in Frenchman Bay almost two months ago.
No illnesses were reported as a result of the September blooms, but a precautionary harvesting ban on parts of the coast from Vinalhaven to Eastport -- an area with little commercial harvesting -- remains in place awaiting testing.
Maine has practiced a successful shellfish safety program for more than 50 years and the state has been held up as the gold standard for monitoring and responding to bacterial and biotoxin problems.
But Maine's biotoxin program is designed to forecast and respond to annual blooms of Alexandrium, commonly known as red tide. Red tide is fairly easy to predict and manage, Kanwit said. If there is a red tide bloom, it is guaranteed to carry saxitoxin, which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning. Red tide predictably blooms in spring and summer and creeps in gradually so monitors can manage it by testing sites on coastal headlands and closing off specific harvesting areas where the toxin exceeds safety limits.
Pseudo-nitzschia doesn't work like red tide. It blooms suddenly and can become extremely poisonous very quickly, even at a low concentration of cells. "They are becoming toxic at cell numbers that are so low, there is something missing here," said Quay Dortch, the coordinator of the harmful algae bloom program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "We don't know, that is what is so strange about Maine."
There are about 13 species of pseudo-nitzschia in the Gulf of Maine, said Mark Wells, a marine biology professor at University of Maine who has studied blooms of the algae on the West Coast. Some species produce toxins while others do not. The species are so closely related researchers need an electron microscope to tell the difference. And they are unpredictable.
"They can bloom at one time with no toxin whatsoever and bloom at another time and be extremely toxic," Wells said. The speed with which it becomes toxic is also alarming, he said.
"... what is happening now is that (monitors) have a really short timeline to make a decision between the time they notice it and when it becomes really toxic."
Toxic species produce domoic acid, which can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, resulting in nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, short-term memory loss and seizures. The only recorded case of domoic acid poisoning occurred in Prince Edward Island in 1987, when three people died and more than 100 became ill after eating tainted blue mussels.
The federal action limit for domoic acid is 20 parts per million. If shellfish exceed that level, state authorities have to stop harvesting and issue a recall for any tainted product.
During the height of the pseudo-nitzschia bloom in 2016, tests revealed mussels near Brooklin and clams near Machiasport had toxin levels more than six times over the health limit. Lobster tomalley tested near Milbridge had almost five times the limit, according to unqualified DMR testing data.
A request for 2017 testing data was not returned by the department.
The sudden toxic blooms have alarmed monitors and scientists, but explanations are in short supply and so is funding to get answers.
Changes in Maine waters may be driving new blooms, Wells said. The Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest-warming bodies of water on Earth, and observers have warned about the ecological changes driven by a warming planet.
"The concern is, we are seeing the start of a trend, it might not happen every year but it may happen more frequently than in the past," he said.
In 2015, a massive bloom of pseudo-nitzschia on the West Coast shut down shellfishing and the lucrative Dungeness crab fishing industry for months. That bloom was connected to a "warm blob" of ocean water pushed onshore, which favored the development of toxic species, Wells said.
"The concern is the warming of the surface waters in the Gulf of Maine might be doing the same thing, but I have to emphasize, we don't know," Wells added.
Researchers also don't fully understand how algae blooms produce toxins, or why, said Dortch, from NOAA. Nutrients, water conditions, sunlight and multiple other envinronmental factors can make a bloom toxic, or not. Some think pseudo-nitzschia may become toxic when it doesn't have enough silica to reproduce, Dortch said.
"I think that at this point we don't really know, it is not just the Gulf of Maine that has this problem," she said.
And it's not likely additional funding for research on harmful blooms will be forthcoming anytime soon. Dortch said funding has never been sufficient for all research proposals and a 2018 budget from the Trump administration eliminates bloom research funding though NOAA.
But while funding is scarce, a scenario where there is no money to study harmful algae blooms is unlikely, said Don Anderson, director of U.S. National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
Scientists have become better at predicting algae blooms, even as the problem is getting worse, in coastal water as well as freshwater lakes and reservoirs. Lake Erie is periodically contaminated by algae blooms and has threatened drinking water for 500,000 in Toledo, Ohio and sickened some people.
The upside of worsening blooms is that politicians and government agencies are taking the problem more seriously and considering support for additional research, Anderson said. Woods Hole is trying to fund a research project focused on pseudo-nitzschia and hopes discoveries will go beyond the science of toxic blooms and develop ways to predict blooms and avoid recalls, Anderson said.
"That is what it is very frustrating, the research that is needed is much more than 'let's get some money to find out why pseudo-nitzschia blooms or doesn't,' it needs to get the managers what they need to deal with it."

Full text: The news, in the spring of 2016, took Hancock County's worm and clam diggers by surprise.
For the first time since the park opened in 1911, Acadia National Park rangers had begun stopping diggers from working the mud abutting park property. A ranger forced a wormer to dump his catch -- a day's work -- in the mud, while clammers had been issued summons for violating park rules.
"It was kind of a shock to everybody," recalls local worm digger Jonathan Renwick, secretary of the Independent Maine Marine Worm Harvesters Association. "Everybody here supports the park -- it's a wonderful thing -- but we should be able to go to work the way we always have, and hopefully calmer heads will prevail and we'll be able to."
Meanwhile, town officials in the area already were alarmed after learning a universally popular expansion of the park on the Schoodic Peninsula was being accomplished without the approval of Congress, upending the provisions of a 1986 law delineating where the park could and could not expand.
Now the Acadia region awaits a congressional fix to these and other park-related issues that have developed in the 31 years since federal lawmakers last considered property issues in and around New England's only national park, from rules about how and where the park can expand to whether it should subsidize local trash collection.
Identical bills submitted in the Senate and House in February by Sen. Angus King and Rep. Bruce Poliquin that seek to resolve these issues have been stalled for months on Capitol Hill.
On Sept. 25, Poliquin, a member of the Republican majority, wrote the leaders of the House natural resources committee, imploring them to schedule a hearing as soon as possible. "This comprehensive, common sense bill addresses a number of time sensitive issues," Poliquin wrote. "Without this legislation moving forward, I fear that the uncertainty for the local communities and for the hardworking shellfish harvesters will create unnecessary stress and conflict within the Bar Harbor Region."
Poliquin declined to be interviewed, but his spokesman, Brendan Conley, said he had not yet received a response to his letter.
The bill would make legal the park's acquisition of the 1,441-acre Schoodic Woods parcel -- a coastal woodland with a campground and bike trails anonymously donated in 2015 -- while prohibiting it from making any future acquisitions that lie outside a boundary line established by Congress in 1986. It would also direct the park to permit harvesting of marine organisms within the park in accordance with state law and local ordinances and to give a consortium of Mount Desert Island town governments $350,000 to subsidize trash disposal.
The Department of the Interior, which oversees the National Park Service, and a local board of advisers to the park, the Acadia Advisory Commission, support the bill but are seeking amendments to each of these provisions.
In acquiring Schoodic Woods, federal authorities circumvented a 1986 boundary law that locals thought had represented a binding compromise between Acadia and surrounding municipalities, raising fears that it would set a precedent and allow the park to acquire land wherever it wished.
"In the 1970s, Acadia had no limits on what it could acquire, and it made towns worry about how they could plan for the future -- where to put a school or a landfill -- when they didn't know what the park would own in future," recalls Ben Emory, of Bar Harbor, who sits on the park advisory commission. "There's no question in the minds of everyone who was here at the time that the intent of the 1986 legislation was to set a permanent boundary, and that anything acquired beyond it would require the approval of Congress."
To most everyone's surprise, in acquiring Schoodic Woods in 2015 -- which lies outside the negotiated boundary -- Acadia invoked a 1929 law that the 1986 law had presumably replaced, a law that lets the Interior secretary accept donations with little restriction.
The park made the move on the recommendation of its attorneys, in this case the Department of the Interior's regional solicitor's office in Newton, Massachusetts. "The question was what legal authorities were available, and the interpretation and advice of the solicitors office was that the 1929 act was a viable authority to receive a donation of land," park spokesman John Kelly said, noting that Congress had not repealed this older law when it passed the 1986 act.
David MacDonald, president of Friends of Acadia, a nonprofit that advocates for the park, says he thinks it was done without ill intent. "I'm sure they looked at the range of options for accepting Schoodic Woods and probably determined that getting legislation through Congress would be a long road," he says. "Folks were so excited about the acquisition, people wanted to see the public benefits sooner rather than later."
"I think it was well-intentioned but underestimated the import people have for the boundary," he said.
The pending bill would approve the Schoodic Woods expansion but make clear that all further acquisitions must comport to the 1986 law, but the Interior Department and members of the local advisory board say it needs to be amended to allow for minor property adjustments and land swaps to resolve surveying problems that come up from time to time between the park and hundreds of abutting landowners.
"These are needed for the public, not the park," says Acadia spokeswoman Christie Anastasia. "Someone might have a survey done and discover that a corner of a building they built is on park land. Clearly we don't want to tell them to take down their building, so we want the ability to do a minor land exchange to clean up the problem. Without that, we'd have to go to Congress to do it."
Poliquin is opposed to making such a change, spokesman Conley said via email, as he "wants to ensure local residents' certainty regarding the boundaries of Acadia and not leave them subject to change without going through the proper processes, such as through legislation in Congress."
King's staff didn't know whether he had a position on this specific issue. Spokesman Jack Faherty said the senator is working with park officials on park land law "to work out an approach that would make sense for everyone."
The legislation would also allow marine harvesting in the intertidal zone adjacent to the park as governed by state law, but Maine authorities and the park don't agree on the issue.
Park authorities have said they regret the enforcement actions taken last year against clammers and wormers, which were decisions made by individual rangers that did not represent an official-mandated change in practice. The park ceased enforcement after harvesters objected, and clammers and wormers have since resumed their work unmolested, pending resolution by Congress.
"We've been able to go right on harvesting like we did before," Renwick says. "The park has acted in good faith with us, and I don't have any complaints since we mounted our initial resistance. But we would probably complain rather loudly if things don't go the way they should."
The details are still up in the air. The Interior Department supports allowing traditional harvesting activities such as clamming, worming and periwinkle harvesting to take place using current hand-tool technology but objects to the bill's wording, which it says would allow mechanical seaweed harvesting, aquaculture operations and other more disruptive activities.
"We have concerns about expanding the harvesting to other 'marine organisms' or to aquaculture activity," acting park service deputy director Robert Vogel said at a July 19 Senate hearing on the bill, arguing that its wording should exclude these activities. "The full range of organisms included in Maine's definition ... could include any species from plants and mollusks to birds fish and mammals" that live below the high-tide mark.
The state Department of Marine Resources says these are not legitimate concerns. Spokesman Jeff Nichols said via email that Maine law does not give his department authority over mammals or birds and clearly stipulates that aquaculture leases can be granted only with the written permission of adjacent coastal landowners -- in this case, the National Park Service. Maine courts, Nichols noted, have ruled that rockweed is the property of the neighboring landowner, so it also cannot be harvested without the park's permission.
"From the state's perspective, if the NPS's primary concern is with ensuring the long-term sustainability of marine resources and harvest, the state's management activities in this regard should be sufficient," Nicholas added.
But others support the park service's position that nontraditional harvesting be excluded from Acadia's intertidal areas.
\Emory says the park advisory commission -- which includes appointees by Gov. Paul LePage as well as the current and previous U.S. Interior secretaries -- agrees. "We have a wide range of viewpoints on the commission, but there is unanimity on supporting traditional harvesting and on opposing rockweed or mechanized forms of harvesting," he said.
Both Poliquin and King are potentially open to adopting more restrictive language on the harvesting issue, their spokesmen said, as the intent is to protect traditional uses.
Park advocates are also concerned about a provision in the draft legislation that would require Acadia to provide $350,000 to a coalition of Mount Desert Island towns to subsidize their waste disposal programs.
In the 1986 law, these funds were to support the creation of an islandwide transfer station that the towns have since decided not to build. Park authorities say it is inappropriate to divert the funds to existing trash disposal, especially since the park already pays the towns to dispose of its waste.
MacDonald, of Friends of Acadia, says that if the provision goes through it would cause significant budgetary problems for the park. "This would have to come out of the park's existing budget, which is razor thin," he says. "It would gut visitors' services, including hiring seasonal assistance, and the downside for surrounding communities would be significant."
The bills would also let the town of Tremont use a parcel of land -- which the park gave it on the condition that it build a now-unwanted school -- for other public purposes. Nobody is certain when the bill might get a hearing in the House, let alone be scheduled for floor votes in both Congressional chambers. But park advisory commission chairwoman Jacqueline Johnston, of Gouldsboro, hopes there's not a long delay.
"The sooner it's taken care of, the better the community will feel about it," Johnston says. "The concept itself is fully supported by the community. It's just finding the means and methods to get there."

Lawmakers rush to fix food sovereignty rules

Full text: AUGUSTA -- With the fate of 90 percent state's locally raised beef, poultry and pork on the line, lawmakers scrambled Friday to reach a deal to fix a recently passed law that originally was meant to allow farmers to sell their goods directly to consumers at their farms.
But after a threat from the federal U.S. Department of Agriculture that could have shuttered five state-licensed slaughterhouses, as well as dozens of other meat-processing facilities including small poultry processors or custom meat cutters, the Legislature's Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee unanimously passed a bill that clarifies the state's food sovereignty law, which allows local governments to set regulations for face-to-face sales on the farm.
Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who signed the sovereignty bill into law earlier this year, called a special lawmaking session to fix the bill and protect the income of thousands of Maine farmers.
But Friday's committee vote also swept up dozens of other commodities beyond meat, making sure that any future concerns by the Food and Drug Administration, the other major federal entity that regulates food safety, would not become a problem for those who grow other types of produce that is processed into food ranging from wild blueberries to aquaculture products such as farmed-raised seaweed and shellfish.
The Legislature is expected to vote on the fix to the law when it comes in on Monday for the special session.
Without the change, the state risks losing its Maine Meat and Poultry Inspection Program on Nov. 1. The operation is sanctioned by the USDA, but is run by the state's Department of Agriculture, which provides daily no-cost inspections for the five slaughterhouses as well as intermittent inspections for more than 30 custom slaughterhouses, 51 small poultry producing facilities and 2,741 retailers, according to the program's manager, State Veterinarian Dr. Jennifer Eberly.
Eberly told the committee Friday that following the passage of the food sovereignty law, federal regulators put Maine on notice that if the state was unable to enforce laws and provisions of the federal Meat and Poultry Inspection Acts, it would lose its designated status and the state's inspection program would have to stop.
Eberly reminded the committee that the state's program was the result of farmers and businesses working together over the last 15 years to develop a system to address an unmet need to expand local slaughterhouse options.
Beyond Eberly, dozens of farmers, including those who raise cattle, hogs, goats and chickens, testified before the committee urging them to fix the law. Many said without the fix they risked losing thousands of dollars.
"Food sovereignty sounds great, but it comes with all these implications," said Melvin Williams, a Waldoboro farmer. "It's about food safety. I don't care how good of a farmer you are, if you don't have somebody looking over your shoulder, you are going to try to pull a fast one. It always happens. This is a temporary fix, but let's get it done."
Lawmakers on the committee said the threat for farms was immediate and real.
"I don't think the general public realized how dire this situation is," said Rep. Russell Black, R-Wilton. Black, who operates a farm, including raising cattle for beef, said lawmakers wanted to protect the rights of municipalities to set their own ordinances around farm sales, but didn't want to run afoul of a food-safety system that intertwines state and federal regulation, especially at the cost of farmers not being able to get their meat processed or to market. He echoed the concerns some had about ensuring a safe food system in Maine. Others pointed out that one bad outbreak of food poisoning from an unregulated farm could give an entire sector a black eye, even if most were following all the best practices for handling and processing food.
A number of witnesses argued state and federal laws regulating food were in place largely to protect consumers' health and safety.
The law being fixed by the bill approved by the committee Friday, "An Act to Recognize Local Control Regarding Food Systems," endorses the right of Maine communities to declare themselves "food sovereign," something 20 communities, including several on the Blue Hill Peninsula, already have done. Another 25 or so municipalities in Maine have similar ordinances under consideration.
In practical terms, it means consumers can buy directly from farmers and food producers in those communities who are operating outside of state and federal licensing. The legislation was intended by those who shaped it, including state Sen. Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, its sponsor, and state Rep. Craig Hickman, D-Winthrop, who has put forth numerous similar bills, as a means to encourage local food production and consumption.
And while all the committee members voted for the bill, some members said they were concerned the proposed law change may have gone a little too far in reeling back provisions of a hard-fought state law that had taken years to pass and was surprisingly supported by LePage.
"Although there is strong reason to think that the federal government's threats could do serious damage to our state and therefore needed something, I think what we ended up passing was a little bit more than what was needed," said Rep. Ralph Chapman, an independent from Brooksville.
In essence, the change, if approved by the full Legislature, would still allow face-to-face sales from farmers to consumers on their farms, but certain products, including meat and poultry, would first have to processed in a licensed slaughterhouse that meets the requirements of federal food safety laws. Other non-processed products such as raw fruits and vegetables, live animals or eggs are not subject to the change.

Full text: Ever since President Donald Trump announced he would review his predecessor's creation of national monuments, Mainers have been focused on the future of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in northern Maine.
But a second New England monument also fell under the review conducted by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, one scientists and conservationists say is essential for understanding the rapid changes going on in the Gulf of Maine and northeast Atlantic.
Zinke has recommended that the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument -- a 4,913-square-mile area of underwater canyons, thousand-year-old coral forests, and volcanic mountains on and beyond the southern edge of Georges Bank at the mouth of the Gulf of Maine -- be opened to commercial fishing, a move proponents say would defeat its purpose.
"With the removal of fishing restrictions, a lot of the benefits of having this undisturbed area go away," said Peter Auster, senior research scientist at the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut, who has explored and studied the area with submarines and remotely operated vehicles. "Undisturbed, the animals in these areas should be able to feed more, grow larger and become more fecund, potentially contributing more to the success of fisheries, even if they're ultimately captured outside the area."
The monument protects undersea canyons, including one deeper than the Grand Canyon, and a group of seamounts taller than Mount Washington, that lie in an area that is not intensively fished. The area is frequented by fin, sei and sperm whales, and is home to groves of fragile, 9-foot-tall coldwater corals. It's the only permanently protected reserve in the federal Atlantic waters and would be the largest entanglement-free area for marine mammals on the Eastern Seaboard. "The idea of opening up the monument to commercial fishing defeats the purpose of having it," said Zack Klyver, senior naturalist with the Bar Harbor Whale Watch Co. "You need a place where stresses are removed to really understand what the true impacts of things like climate change and ocean acidification are."
Zinke's recommendation, which was leaked to The Washington Post and published Sept. 17, was applauded by seafood interests, particularly in southern New England, who had opposed President Barack Obama's designation of the monument in 2016.
Eric Reid, of Rhode Island-based Seafreeze Ltd., a major supplier of frozen-at-sea seafood that operates a fleet of fishing vessels, said the monument was designated after "behind-closed-door campaigns led by large, multinational, environmental lobbying firms despite vocal opposition from local and federal officials, fisheries managers and the fishing industry." Zinke's recommendations, he said, "make us hopeful that we can recover the areas we have fished sustainably for decades."
The heads of eight of the nation's fisheries management councils -- the industry-led bodies that implement fisheries regulations in federal waters -- were already on record against the commercial fishing restrictions.
In a May 16 letter to Zinke and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, they said the bans were potentially counterproductive because they "disrupted the ability of the Councils to manage fisheries throughout their range as required by (the federal fisheries act) and in an ecosystem-based manner."
Five fishing industry associations -- including the Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, the Atlantic Offshore Lobstermen's Association and the Rhode Island Fishermen's Alliance -- have a pending suit against the federal government alleging presidents do not have the power to designate marine monuments because the Antiquities Act refers to "land" controlled by the federal government.
The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts monument doesn't qualify because it's submerged and is located more than 12 nautical miles from shore, inside the United States' Exclusive Economic Zone, but outside its territorial waters, said Jim Burling, vice president for litigation at the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, California, which is representing the fishing groups.
Burling said it's too early to tell whether Zinke's recommendation will satisfy the groups' concerns with the monument.
"The proof will be in the pudding," he said. "We talk about management changes today, but those could be changed back with the next administration. We think the time will have to come to determine the legality of these kinds of national monuments."
Peter Shelley, of the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental attorney who is watching the case closely, strongly disagrees. "Their arguments run against the phalanx of academic and legal opinion on the act," he said, adding that the federal government has controlled fishing activities in the area since 1976, and that other countries around the world have created marine reserves in their Exclusive Economic Zones.
"But the most distressing thing about the litigation are the preposterous claims of economic harm that have been made, particularly by the offshore lobster industry," Shelley added. "There's no evidence or data that suggest the impacts are going to be significant in any respect."
Recreational fishing, bird and whale watching are allowed in the reserve, and lobster and red crab fishermen have seven years to move their gear out of the area.
An economic impact analysis prepared in July by the Washington-based environmental consultancy TBD Economics predicted lobster fishermen would face at most minor losses: between a net $85,000 annual loss and a $10,000 annual gain, once potential spillover benefits of protected breeding populations within the monument were taken into account. The report said this represented about 0.015 percent of the fishery.
Red crab fishermen would face slightly greater net losses of between $34,000 and $188,000 a year, the study estimated.
Auster said scientists haven't thoroughly evaluated the monument's spillover effects, but that the most likely beneficiaries would be lobster, mackerel, squid and redfish stocks, as those species use the reserve in substantial numbers.
The monument was originally to include Cashes Ledge, an underwater mountain ridge 80 miles east of Kittery, but that component was dropped in the face of opposition from fishermen and even the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Shelley said it was in Maine's interest to have the seamounts and canyons area not be actively fished or lobstered on account of the rapid warming of the Gulf of Maine, which is expected to displace traditional commercial fish species and is making the seawater more acidic, compromising the ability of at least some shellfish to grow their shells.
"There needs to be at least one control area in the U.S. North Atlantic where there would be a reference site to help distinguish potential offshore impacts associated with climate change from those caused by fishing," he said. "If lobsters suddenly started to crash, is it because of harvesters or because of temperatures? Having places like this could help us to rule out some things."
But Paul Molyneaux, a fisheries development consultant from East Machias and author of "Doryman's Reflection," a personal account of the collapse of New England groundfishing, said some commercial fishing practices are compatible with the goals of the monument.
"It all depends on the scale and the gear," he said. "Commercial fishing takes in destructive gear types but also people making a living with a rod and reel. Some of them are probably able to take place that are going to be consistent with a healthy marine ecosystem."
Trump has been expected for several weeks to decide whether to adopt Zinke's recommendations. A spokesman for the Department of the Interior did not respond to requests for comment.

Full text: arah Wineburg graduated from College of the Atlantic in 2013 with a degree in human ecology -- as do all undergraduates at the Bar Harbor college -- and she still calls herself a human ecologist. But here are some other descriptors Wineburg has had in the last year: oyster farmer, seaweed harvester, Montessori school teacher, captain of a sailing lobster boat, sailing instructor, and program director for the educational programs on the schooner Harvey Gamage.
And then there is her most recent gig, working with Harvest Moon catering in Waldoboro.
She just turned 27. She's in love, with her boyfriend and with Maine, and with what she calls "a really beautiful life," one geared toward tackling the world's sustainability issues, rather than adding to them. But sometimes?
"Sometimes I wish I had a job somewhere that was really stable and where I knew how much money I was going to make," Wineburg said.
That is a refrain often heard throughout professional circles in Maine, a state crawling with people with necessary side gigs, whether they involve snow plowing in winter or picking up restaurant shifts in summer. But among Maine millennials working within the field of sustainability, quite often at nonprofits, it's a particularly common phenomenon. And sometimes it goes beyond the single side gig to three or four part-time jobs that together, pay the rent, the student loans and not much else.
"You really have to want to do this," said Sandy Gilbreath, who works 20 hours a week at Maine Food Strategy, an initiative to advance collaboration in Maine food systems. She's pursuing her passion for local food issues, but since May, when funding cuts meant going part time at Maine Food Strategy, she's also been working part time as a bartender at the Riverside Grill at the Portland Golf Course. She holds an undergraduate degree from the University of Southern Maine in environmental planning and policy and a masters from USM's Muskie School in Policy, Planning and Management.
She's devoted to improving Maine's food systems, from promoting connectivity between local foods and Mainers to cutting back on food waste. And so are many of her friends, which tends to mean they're putting in resumes for the same few job openings. In July, Gilbreath spoke at an event sponsored by Portland Global Shapers Hub, a leadership group initiative of the World Economic Forum, Attendees had come for a discussion about how to make it in Maine, and they shared in Gilbreath's dilemma; making the world more sustainable is not exactly economically sustainable on a personal level. "The theme for all the speakers was that everyone had a side hustle," Gilbreath said.
"Everyone is overqualified," she added. "We all do it for the mission."
The mission is to make a better, more sustainable world and there are many ways to do that. For Gilbreath, it's through food policy, for others it might be promoting clean energy, working in sustainable fisheries or agriculture, education, forestry or wildlife biology. None of these are get-rich-quick fields.
On a day in early summer, Wineburg led the way through the fields at the Great Salt Bay Farm & Heritage Center in Damariscotta. It was time to check on her fledgling oyster farm, something she does every week or every few weeks, depending on her busy work schedule.
"I have like six jobs," she said. "I love all of them, but..."
Most have something to do with being on the water and while she wishes this weren't the case, some of her gigs are tied to the tourism industry. She worries she's selling out her lifestyle. Like her summer gig hauling lobster traps from a sailboat, showing tourists how the old timers did it.
"Like my way of life is someone's quaint vacation," she said, "when in reality I can barely pay my taxes."
There's also the seasonal factor; tourists tend to depart after Labor Day and so do their dollars.
"I have no idea what I'm going to do this winter," she said later, as she flipped through oysters, checking for mortality (she'd only lost a few) and growth (good). This is less like a farm than a garden, actually, since it's not yet commercial; Wineburg is enrolled in a two-year oyster gardening program intended to introduce students to the aquaculture movement. She gets to eat a lot of oysters, and, a side bonus for a young woman whose friends are partnering off for weddings on a regular basis is that she can gift them with oysters.
The sailing trips she leads, or crews on, some from Rockland Harbor, some Down East with Sail Acadia, are touristy too, but they go into the fall, and she feels as though they are "meaningful" because she's introducing people to the beauty of Maine's coast and natural resources. "And hopefully getting them to think about conserving it."
Emma Burnett volunteers with Portland Global Shapers Hub and helped organize the making it in Maine event where Gilbreath spoke in July. Burnett is a native Mainer who returned to the state after working in San Francisco; she came back with digital credibility and is able to work in digital communications on a national level, remotely. She feels lucky she's not racing around for multiple gigs, working for nonprofits, like many of her friends. The Maine economy presents a particular challenge for those working in sustainability areas like food systems, Burnett said.
"We have a lot of young people who want to have meaningful work lives," Burnett said. "But there are so many problems with it, salary being just one. Basically only people with family wealth can support a life on those salaries."
By family wealth, Burnett doesn't mean Kennebunkport seaside mansion style money; she means a parental safety net, often associated with white privilege. She considers herself in that category.
"I have got parents who are from around here who can pay my cell phone bill for 10 years," she said. "I lived with them for six months when I moved back home. I can ask them if I need to put down a deposit on an apartment."
She's struck by the irony of a situation where nonprofits trying to do good are paying so little.
"You are trying to help communities grow their own food, and you are forcing a white person with inherited wealth into the position because they are the only person who can afford it," Burnett said.
There's steep competition for these nonprofit jobs too.
"If there is one job opening it is like, everyone knows about it," said Olivia Dooley, who has been piecing together an income in sustainability work in the last two years in Maine, including temping, grant writing for Wolfe's Neck Farm, a stint on the Mayor's Initiative for a Healthy and Sustainable Food System (now the Portland Food Council) and an AmeriCorps gig that placed her with the Good Shepherd Food Bank. "Everyone is like, 'Have you seen that? Have you applied for that?' So you end up competing against friends."
Dooley recently landed a full-time job as the Northeast field organizer for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, a job that will take her as far as New York but allows her to live in Maine. She's not from the state but after she finished her master's in public affairs at the University of Washington and her boyfriend finished medical school, he landed a residency at Maine Medical Center. She'd been in Maine two full years before getting this job. In the early days in Maine, when she compared the local listserv with the one she was still getting from Seattle, the prospects for local employment seemed bleak.
"Just the quantity of options on a daily email listserv... it was a stark contrast," Dooley said. "But at the same time, the quality of life in Maine is pretty hard to beat," she added.
Jay Friedlander, a professor at College of the Atlantic (COA), said young people interested in sustainability often end up participating in that gig economy in larger numbers than some of their peers, either because they're interested in entrepreneurship or simply aren't interested in corporate life. "People are looking for careers that bring together the professional and the personal," Friedlander said.
So how do Maine colleges help their students prepare for it? At COA, one way is by fostering them through a program Friedlander runs called the Hatchery, which allows students with a business idea to explore it, for credit and with mentorship, full time for a 10-week term. Entrepreneurial students can test drive their idea before they graduate, and even if they're bartending on the weekends while they start to make that idea a reality, they've got the comfort of a game (or business) plan.
"At a place like COA, you get a lot of students who are on the forefront of what is next," Friedlander said. "As a result of that, they are out there, and they are establishing whole new industries, which can often mean that you're putting it together."
At Unity College, where the motto is "America's environmental college," a team of three supplies career counseling, from internships to full-time jobs to graduate programs. "Even though we have only 700 students," said Melik Khoury, the president of Unity, slightly more than 90 percent of graduates are either headed to graduate school or have a job within six months of graduation. "We are very proud of our placement rate."
But he's just as proud of their values.
"We educate them to be environmental stewards, first and foremost," Khoury said. "Money is a secondary motivator for most of them. And what we are finding is that students are more interested in working in jobs that mean more to them. On average, they do make a little less than I would say students from some of the Ivy League schools that are not focused on the environment."
But surveys of Unity graduates point to strong job satisfaction, he said. Meaningful work is a choice.
Sandy Gilbreath, the bartender with the graduate degree who is working so hard to reshape Maine's food system, would agree. Sure, it's not always easy to spend weekend nights bartending when friends are kicking back and relaxing. She said she could go get a job "as a secretary at a law firm and it would be a stable 9 to 5 job." But it wouldn't be fixing the world, or at least, Maine's food systems.
"You really do have to want it," she said. "It is worth the hustle."

Rare algae bloom threatens Casco Bay

Author: McGuire, Peter

Publication info: Morning Sentinel ; Waterville, Me. [Waterville, Me]27 Sep 2017: 2.B.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1943008908?accountid=10457

Full text: State authorities are warning shellfish harvesters and others of a "massive" algae bloom in Casco Bay that can create low-oxygen dead zones, potentially lethal to fish, shellfish, lobsters and other marine animals.
The full extent of the bloom is unclear, but the state's warning coincides with a sudden die-off of softshell clams in Brunswick. About 14 acres of productive clam flats in Maquoit Bay are almost completely denuded of adult clams, a loss of up to $250,000 to local harvesters, Brunswick Marine Resources Officer Dan Devereaux said in an interview Tuesday.
Mud in the area is dotted with clam holes filled with dead clams and black water that Devereaux believes is depleted of oxygen.
Despite the timing of the die-off, Devereaux is not convinced it is connected to the Casco Bay bloom. The affected area is limited, and only one type of shellfish appears to be affected.
"There are so many things it could be outside of an algae bloom," Devereaux said. "It is not affecting quahogs or razor clams, just softshell clams dying in their holes."
The Department of Marine Resources on Tuesday said it was monitoring an unusual bloom of Karenia mikimotoi, the first time a harmful bloom of this phytoplankton has occurred in Maine waters, as far as the state knows.
The bloom is not hazardous to humans, but is associated with fish deaths in Asia, Europe and Alaska.
Thick, brown-green clouds of algae were clearly visible off the docks of South Port Marine in South Portland on Tuesday afternoon, completely obscuring the harbor bottom.
Recent tests showed areas around the marina had some of the highest concentrations of phytoplankton, according to Kohl Kanwit, director of the public health division at the Department of Marine Resources.
State officials regularly monitor for other types of harmful algae blooms, such as red tide, that can contaminate shellfish and cause illness or death in humans. However, it doesn't have experience with this type of phytoplankton and is monitoring the situation closely.
"We are not able to predict if a low-oxygen event will occur or if the current levels of Karenia mikimotoi will have wide-scale negative impacts on shellfish, but we are very concerned about these possibilities," the department's public health division said Tuesday.
Maine's commercial fisheries were worth $721 million last year, and any threat to marine life could have serious consequences for the state's economy.
The department recommended seafood dealers who source storage water from affected areas come up with contingency plans to protect their product.
Matt Moretti, owner of Bangs Island Mussels in Portland, said he and lobstermen friends started seeing brown tinted water in parts of Casco Bay in the last few weeks and alerted the department.
So far, the bloom seems to be concentrated in the Fore River, Portland Harbor and parts of Harpswell, Moretti said. While he isn't worried the bloom will hurt his mussel farms near Chebeague Island and Falmouth, the scale of the bloom is unsettling.
"We have visually been seeing it, which is bad," Moretti said. "It is disturbing that it is here now. It has never been here before."
While the algae's toxicity is not fully understood, scientists think the die-offs are caused by a low-oxygen environment created by a combination of the bloom itself and a toxin carried by the phytoplankton, the department said. Shellfish such as mussels, clams and oysters, fin fish and crustaceans such as lobsters could be affected.
"I would say this is another unprecedented occurrence in New England," said Kate Hubbard, an expert on harmful algae blooms with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission who is assisting the Maine Department of Marine Resources as it monitors the bloom.
Single-celled phytoplankton exist naturally in the environment, but under the right conditions they can grow quickly. In the case of an intense bloom like the one in Casco Bay, millions and millions of cells are concentrated in one area. Respiration by those cells and decomposition after death depletes dissolved oxygen in the water and can create dead zones of low or no oxygen where other organisms cannot survive.
"Basically, it is all related to the biomass of the bloom," Hubbard said. "Some of the cell concentrations that DMR is observing are very, very high. You are able to see water discoloration."
Fish die-offs have been reported during blooms of Karenia mikimotoi in Hong Kong, Australia, Ireland, Japan, Korea and Alaska, among other areas.
Maine authorities are asking anyone who observes a die-off of marine organisms in the Casco Bay region to report it to the marine patrol.

Full text: I love their story. Tony and Laura Moskwa checked out more than 40 inns on the East Coast before purchasing the Bradley Inn in New Harbor. And they love our state, as does their son Ross, who decided to move here with them to serve as a chef at the inn's restaurant. They are all friendly hosts, truly enjoying visiting with each and every guest.
Since taking over here last spring, they've been hard at work making improvements, while retaining the great history of this special place, just a short walk from the Pemaquid Point Lighthouse.
We spent the afternoon at Pemaquid Point, starting with a picnic, and enjoying the Pemaquid Art Gallery and the Fisherman's Museum on the grounds of the lighthouse. We got a friendly greeting from Clarissa as we entered the inn, and spent an hour with Tony and Laura touring their buildings and talking about their experiences here.
Our dinner at the inn was superb. A couple we know happened to be seated next to us, and he is an expert in commercial fisheries, so I paid close attention to what he ordered and I ordered the same thing. Our servers, Suzie (who has worked for nine years here) and Rosalyn (a new employee) were helpful and attentive. The wine list is extensive, and we chose an Italian Sangiovese ($10/glass).
For my starter, I enjoyed the local Bristol mussels ($12), with preserved tomato and fresh herbs. This was my favorite dish. The mussels were cooked perfectly, and sat in a tasty sauce. The portion was large, but I ate every mussel. There was quite a bit of sauce left in my bowl when I was done, but Linda forbade me from drinking it.
That turned out to be OK, because I had another tasty sauce with my sustainable local fish entree ($33), which on this night turned out to be swordfish. The dish included more mussels, saffron-rosemary frigola and little-neck clams.
I also loved Linda's steak, and was amazed that she ate all of the mammoth serving. At the next table, a gentleman from Colorado who ran a meat packing plant was also raving about the steak. He should know.
We haven't been to the Pemaquid area for a long time. It was a once-a-year trip to the ocean for my family when I was growing up. I remember climbing and picnicking on the rocks there.
I immensely enjoyed spending a big part of the day at Pemaquid Lighthouse. We indulged in reading a long time in our double-seat traveling chair with a spectacular view and sounds of the ocean crashing on the rocks. Things like this are what make a day magical for me.
I wasn't prepared for how beautiful the grounds at the Bradley Inn are. Sprawling lawns with well-tended plantings of flowers and shrubs are kept in tip-top shape by Tony.
The inn has 16 rooms, ranging from one with twin beds to a suite in the carriage house that has a full kitchen. There is also a cute cottage available. The inn is able to host weddings when tents are set up in the large backyard.
Our third-floor room had a pine vaulted ceiling, a high four-poster bed, a gas fireplace and antique furniture. It was comfortable and offered a view of Johns Bay.
Dinner is a memorable event at the Bradley Inn. The dining room is off-white with mellow green beadboard on the lower half of the walls. The lights hanging from loopy cords lend a modern feel to the space.
The real memories begin when the elegant food comes out. An amuse-bouche of creamy roasted butternut squash soup with creme fraiche was the offering that evening. It was great.
There were lots of choices for appetizers and starters, but the salad special that evening won me over. The kale and arugula salad with roasted beets, toasted quinoa and goat cheese had a preserved lemon dressing. It was cool, light and refreshing and had a nice texture because of the quinoa.
Each part of my steak was exquisite. Perfectly medium-rare hanger steak was sliced and served with the most amazing french fries ever, atop a white truffle aioli. The beef melted in your mouth. The fries were crispy outside and flavored with herbs, while the center was creamy. If you don't get an entree here that includes the fries, plan ahead and order them as an appetizer.
The vegetables were also perfect. Grilled corn on the cob pieces and crunchy baby rainbow carrots were served with tomato butter. It was a beautiful presentation, and a plate of food I will dream about.
Breakfast is included with your stay and is another extraordinary spread. Fresh fruit, blueberry muffins and a smoothie will start you off. And the entree of the day will keep you from being hungry again for most of the day.
This is an inn to put on your must-visit list. Surely you deserve a respite this fall or next summer.

Full text: 98% of recalled mussels recovered after potentially fatal biotoxin scare
Thousands of pounds of Maine mussels recalled because of concern about potential contamination from a marine biotoxin were distributed as far away as Georgia and Missouri before being recovered and destroyed.
Almost 58,500 pounds of mussels harvested near Mount Desert Island were subject to the recall, initiated last Friday, of which 38 pounds sold to retail establishments remain unaccounted for in Maine. Five Maine seafood dealers affected by the recall were able to recover 98 percent of the suspect mussels within three days, according to the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
The department called for a recall after testing found elevated levels of the neurotoxin domoic acid in mussels. Domoic acid is produced by a bloom of Pseudo-nitszchia, a phytoplankton found in Maine waters. The toxin may cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, which can make humans ill if ingested and, in extreme instances, cause paralysis or death.
In response to the harmful bloom, the department put a precautionary ban on about a third of Maine's coastline from Mount Desert Island to Calais. On Wednesday, the DMR reopened some harvesting areas after determining there was no biotoxin risk.
The recall was for mussels harvested in Frenchman Bay between Mount Desert Island and the mainland from Sept. 10 to 14 that were found to have elevated levels of domoic acid. Possibly contaminated mussels were distributed in 10 states: Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The vast majority of recalled mussels were sold to wholesale dealers and were not yet distributed to retail businesses, said DMR spokesman Jeff Nichols.
Approximately 38,905 pounds of mussels, about 66 percent of the total, were recovered in Maine, according to figures released by the department Wednesday. Only 240 pounds were sold to stores or restaurants and 38 pounds are unaccounted for, Nichols said. The department did not immediately respond to an inquiry about where the missing mussels may have been sold.
The department announced a ban on harvesting clams, mussels, oysters and whelks in Down East areas a week ago in response to the toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom. It later extended a harvesting ban to parts of the Penobscot River and Cobscook Bay.
On Wednesday, the department decided there was no risk from the biotoxin and reopened those areas. There is still a ban on harvesting clams, mussels, oysters and whelks between the southwest point of Mount Desert Island and Cranberry Point in Gouldsboro, and around Eastport and Lubec at the easternmost tip of the state. A precautionary ban on harvesting mussels, European oysters and surf clams is still in place for some sections of coastline between Gouldsboro and Lubec, and around Vinalhaven, Isle Au Haut and Swan's Island.
Domoic acid is sometimes produced by intense blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia, a marine phytoplankton. The toxin stores in the flesh of bivalves like mussels, clams and oysters and can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning. Symptoms of amnesic shellfish poisoning include gastrointestinal upset, headache, confusion, dizziness, disorientation and memory loss. In extreme cases the poisoning can cause brain damage or death in humans
Symptoms begin within 24 hours of eating contaminated shellfish, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Tainted shellfish looks, smells and tastes normal, and cooking will not kill the toxin.
As of this week, the department's health division had not received any reports of people sickened by the potentially tainted mussels.

Full text: Maine health officials address early flu cases
AUGUSTA -- Early cases of the flu in Maine have prompted state officials to increase vaccination efforts.
The Banger Daily News reported multiple Maine hospitals have reported positive lab tests for influenza. Flu season usually begins in early October, but early cases of the illness have forced the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention to take action.
Authorities said Influenza A and B strains are currently circulating nationwide. Health officials recommend receiving the quadrivalent flu vaccine to guard against four strains of influenza this season. Vaccine effectiveness varies from person to person.
Authorities are reminding Maine residents to wash their hands regularly and cover coughs to reduce the spread of illnesses this season. Flu symptoms include fever, muscle aches and coughing.
Maine home sales up more than 6 percent
AUGUSTA -- The Maine Association of Realtors says sales of existing single-family homes increased by more than 6 percent in August.
The association said the median sales price for the homes also increased by more than 4.5 percent, to $206,000. Association president Greg Gosselin says the housing market is experiencing a strong end of summer push that is likely to continue into the fall.
The National Association of Realtors said sales were up less than a half a percent across the country, while the national median sales price increased by a little more than 5.5 percent.
Sales in Maine increased the most in Kennebec County, where they went up by nearly 17 percent. They were slowest in Piscataquis County, where they went down by more than 14 percent.
Owner of Bangor Mall at risk of defaulting
BANGOR -- Industry analysts say the primary owner of the Bangor Mall in Maine is at risk of defaulting on an $80 million loan that uses the mall as collateral.
The Bangor Daily News reported Simon Property Group of Indianapolis took out the loan in 2007 and has made only interest payments. The paper reported that lender Morgan Stanley Capital turned the loan over to a special servicer that handles troubled debts in late August.
The mall was appraised at $128 million when Simon took out the loan. But a recent Morningstar Credit Ratings report valued the mall at only $66.6 million and estimates that Simon has a 50 percent chance of defaulting.
The mall lost one of its four anchor tenants last spring. Leases for two other anchors face renewal soon.
Compiled from wire reports NOAA funding algal bloom research in Maine, 6 other states
PORTLAND -- Maine is among seven states where the federal government is funding a research project to try to better understand harmful algal blooms.
Harmful algal blooms can contaminate drinking water and have negative effects on the environment, wildlife and tourism. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is providing nearly $1.7 million for research projects about the blooms in Alaska, California, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Ohio and Virginia.
The Maine grant is an award of nearly $250,000 for a project led by Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences and the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The institutions hope to increase the number of options available to states to monitor diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins.
DSP is a food safety threat for shellfish consumers.
Police: Woman killed when vehicle slams into tractor trailer
AUBURN -- State police say a woman was killed when her vehicle slammed into the back of a tractor trailer as she was exiting the Maine Turnpike.
Maine Department of Safety Spokesman Steve McCausland said the woman's car was seen speeding Tuesday night. He said a state trooper had just activated the blue lights on his cruiser to pull the vehicle over when the driver exited and crashed into the back of a tractor trailer in Auburn.
Police said the woman who died was 41-year-old Amie Wells of Greene. They said 40-year-old tractor trailer driver Vincent Moura Voelz of Little Elm, Texas, was not hurt.
Beer brewed in honor of 217-year-old American Elm tree
YARMOUTH -- A Maine brewery is paying tribute to a centuries-old American Elm tree named Herbie with a new pale ale named in the tree's honor.
"Herbie" is a low-alcohol pale ale with citrus notes that will be released Thursday at the Yarmouth Farmers Market. The beer was brewed by Portland-area brewery Liquid Riot.
Herbie stood in Yarmouth from 1793 until the 110-foot tree died in 2010 at age 217.
Liquid Riot co-owner Eric Michaud said they were asked to come up with a special beer for the expanded farmers market, and thought people of all ages could connect to the story of Herbie.
The beer will be available in cans and on tap in various Yarmouth establishments and at Liquid Riot in Portland.

DEP practices oil spill response

Full text: Maine DEP's oil spill removal team is doing drills this week along the Kennebec River, including on Tuesday in the area around Swan Island and Richmond.
Exercises will continue this week in Hallowell
RICHMOND ï¿½ There was no oil spill Tuesday afternoon on the Kennebec River, but for several hours, members of the stateï¿½s hazardous materials cleanup teams pretended otherwise.
Off the eastern shore of Swan Island, they used boats and anchors to stretch yellow barriers across the river, trying to protect sensitive shellfish habitats from the imaginary oil slick floating on the surface.
But the currents were real as the responders adjusted the yellow barriers, known as containment booms. And their work had to be precise, because in a real spill, the right mix of wind and other elements easily could splash a pollutant over the sides of the booms if they were not placed properly, said Jeff Squire, director of response services in the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
Squire oversees four teams of people, spread across the state, who are called whenever oil and chemicals are spilled because of traffic accidents and other incidents. Besides trying to collect the materials that have spilled, they also investigate what might have caused the spill, Squire said.
While the teams commonly respond to spills involving petroleum products such as gasoline and home heating oil, they also help dispose of more obscure materials.
For example, Squire described one recent response in which old containers of cyanide were found in the Rome property that the Travis Mills Foundation has converted to a retreat for wounded veterans. The cyanide was part of a pest control product, Squire said, but it is also poisonous to people.
Half of the stateï¿½s hazardous materials response workers will be on the Kennebec River all this week, practicing their marine response skills as part of an annual in-service training. Next week, the other half will participate in the same training.
On Monday, they donned waterproof survival suits and practiced cold water rescue work. On Thursday, theyï¿½ll be holding a drill in Hallowell.
They chose to do the training on this section of the Kennebec River because itï¿½s centrally located and includes difficult currents, Squire said. They have been using a classroom space on Swan Island, a wildlife preservation area operated by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife.
ï¿½Every year, the focus and subject matter (of the training) will vary depending on organizational assessments,ï¿½ Squire said. ï¿½This year, we found a need to enhance some of our waterborne skills with regards to pollution and oil spill response.ï¿½
Last year, Squire said, the division held its training at a potato refrigeration facility operated by McCain Foods in Presque Isle, to give workers experience in a different type of setting where they might have to clean up hazardous materials.
One of the Maine DEP workers on Swan Island this week, Tiffany LaClair, recently returned from a weeklong oil-spill training course in Corpus Christi, Texas, where they used peat moss to simulate the way oil will float in water.
LaClair has worked for the stateï¿½s response division for just six months, after working in another part of the Maine DEP for about three years, she said. She used to clean waterways while working as a park ranger in Massachusetts, she said, and she welcomed the opportunity to do similar work in Maine.
During one of the exercises Tuesday afternoon, she lay an anchor on Swan Island that would hold one end of a containment boom getting stretched across the river.
The exercises were useful, she said, because they helped show ï¿½what can go wrongï¿½ in any response, whether itï¿½s a misplaced boom or mechanical failure on a watercraft.
ï¿½Youï¿½re never really sure what youï¿½re going to get,ï¿½ she said of the job. ï¿½Overall, itï¿½s great.ï¿½

Bill would undermine business

Full text: I HAVE OWNED and operated an oyster farm on the coast of Maine for 32 years. Each year, we raise more than 100 million seed oysters, which we supply to other growers across the Eastern Seaboard, along with fully grown oysters we sell here in Maine and throughout the United States.
It's been a rewarding journey -- not everyone is lucky enough to spend their career working out on the Damariscotta River, or taste the fruits of their labor on the half shell. But that doesn't mean it's always been easy. Over the years, we've faced hurdles -- just as any business has. But now we face a new challenge: a bill in Congress that disguises itself as regulatory reform.
I know, firsthand, the frustration of complying with poorly conceived and executed rules and regulations. Yet I also can say, unequivocally, that without environmental regulations, my company would not be successful today and would very likely have gone out of business years ago. Let's be clear about the goals that should guide our elected leaders who enact laws and the government agencies that carry them out: to maintain and promote a strong economy while protecting public health and ensuring a clean environment. The Regulatory Accountability Act, currently making its way through Congress, seriously misses the mark on creating a framework in which all businesses can thrive.
My business is wholly dependent on clean coastal waters. In 1998, I was nearly put out of business by a septic tank pumper illegally emptying his truck 150 yards from our hatchery intake pipe. But many factors -- sometimes from distant sources -- can seriously affect the productivity of the ocean ecosystem I rely on.
For example, carbon emissions are causing acid levels in our coastal waters to increase as more CO2 dissolves in the water and freshwater runoff increases. Warming ocean temperatures are linked to the rise of pathogenic bacteria that can kill our oysters or make people sick. For us to avoid these threats and continue providing safe, healthy seafood to consumers, we must have clear, common-sense regulatory limits on pollution -- period.
I believe that Congress could pursue regulatory reform that provides targeted fixes to the process -- like bringing all stakeholders to the table earlier in the process and creating a schedule for reviewing rules at regular intervals. But the Regulatory Accountability Act is not the answer. Under the guise of regulatory reform, this proposal would add a new litany of bureaucratic hurdles, making it even harder for businesses like ours to navigate the already complex regulatory system.
Only in Washington would politicians try to solve the problem of slow bureaucracy with more bureaucracy. Yet that is exactly what the Regulatory Accountability Act proposes. The legislation imposes dozens of new procedural requirements; requires far-reaching, complex new analyses; sets in motion trial-like, formal hearing requirements; provides new avenues to petition for hearings; and includes many new legal avenues for court challenges.
And, potentially most importantly, it focuses only on the potential costs of regulations, and does not adequately balance those against benefits. This means that the benefit I provide to the local economy and our food supply will not be appropriately considered when calculating the cost of compliance for practices by other businesses that affect my operation. Rather than streamlining the process and providing for more regulatory certainty and accountability, the Regulatory Accountability Act will bring the regulatory process to a halt.
We've been harvesting oysters for over 30 years, and I hope we can do the same for decades to come. But to do so, we need a federal government capable of ensuring clean waters, setting responsible limits on pollution and providing a predictable business environment. In Maine, the aquaculture industry is growing rapidly, creating good jobs and diversifying Maine's marine economy. The Regulatory Accountability Act would take Maine, and our nation, in the wrong direction.
I hope Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King oppose this misguided legislation. If it passes, Wall Street firms and D.C. lobbyists might be thrilled, but small businesses like ours and Maine consumers will pay the price.

Full text: bout nine years ago, Tom Harms noticed some long faces in October. His family farm, Wolf Pine Farm in Alfred, was wrapping up its summer CSA and customers were picking up the last boxes they'd been receiving all season as part of the farms Community Supported Agriculture shares.
"They were all sad, like, 'Now you are going to make us go back to the supermarket until next June?' " Harms said.
That's when Harms and his wife and farming partner Amy Sprague decided to venture into the world of winter CSAs as a means of keeping customers year-round. The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association doesn't track numbers of winter CSAs, but the practice is increasingly popular with young farmers who are pushing the boundaries of four-season agriculture.
But even with more and more fresh produce available in the state year round as farmers employ high tunnel or even heated greenhouse methods to grow in Maine, winter CSAs are not for the faint-hearted. As a farmer, you've got to come up with the goods at a time when the world is brown and grey and white. And you don't get a season "off." Not that most farmers don't work year-round anyway;, but most get a break from customers when the snow flies.
Harms took a popular approach, forming an alliance with other farmers throughout Maine and beyond. For his meat share, he found a farmer to supply grass-fed beef from Vermont, for instance, and Sprague started planting more root vegetables on their home farm. Now they have over 400 customers in a winter CSA that serves up goods from roughly 15 vegetable farmers and five other producers who rotate in and out depending on what's available. It could be mushrooms from Mousam Valley in nearby Sanford. Or he might call up his friend Jim Amaral at Borealis Breads. "I just reached out to him and said, 'Jim, do something fun.' So he gets to have 400 guinea pigs in my shareholders, eating whatever he makes with ancient grains or whatever he is playing around with that day."
Harms and Sprague haven't sold their produce at farmers market in years, and though Harms said he misses the socializing somewhat, the year-round CSA is more reliable. "One of the more awesome parts of it is that all of your food is sold and you don't have to worry about rainy days and busy times and all of the other stressors of the farmers market," Harms said.
Jill Agnew of Willow Pond Farm in Sabattus has the double distinction of being the first farmer in Maine to adopt the modern CSA model, back in 1989, and the first to run a winter CSA, which she started that same year. The farm already had an orchard to bring in customers in the fall; while they were picking up apples, they could take a box of say, root vegetables and other storage crops home. "And I don't really care to leave the farm that much," she laughed. She also got a nudge from her brother-in-law, whom she had been regularly supplying with bags of food from the farm. "He'd say, 'You know, a lot of people would be really into getting these bags of food.' "
The year-round aspect of her CSA never daunted her.
"I'm always up for a challenge and the whole concept of it just made so much sense to me," Agnew said. "Everybody eats root crops all winter, and we were all behind the idea of encouraging people to eat food seasonally and locally." She set up some satellite pickup locations, including one at her sister's house in Falmouth, but she also has customers who come to the farm, where she stocks other goodies, like her chevre, meats from Farmers' Gate or value-added products like gingered carrots.
Not every winter CSA works out. At Oyster River Winery, farmer and winemaker Brian Smith started one a couple of years ago that was straight out of a Currier and Ives print: Meats and cheese and bread from local farmers and producers, topped off with wine from Oyster River and delivered by a horse-drawn wagon along an 11-mile route in the Rockland area. But there were logistical issues, including the complications of liquor laws that kept other members of his alliance from helping with deliveries. Smith said he might revisit a CSA in the future, but for now he's selling wine in his club.
A tempting winter months bacon and sausage club run out of Old Crow Ranch in Durham (5 pounds every four weeks for $60) is also on hiatus, said farmer Steve Sinisi, thanks to equipment and labeling issues. He's focusing instead on sales of whole animals, predominately through area butchers. "Our meat ordering system is really like a modified CSA," he said.
Most winter CSAs have at least a slightly modified approach.
Another longtime player in the year-round CSA game, Nezinscot Farm in Turner, uses the term CSA but participants in that "all-diet CSA" program don't get deliveries. Instead, they pay a lump sum in advance and are invited to shop in Gloria and Gregg Varney's farm store, where they can get everything from craft supplies to farm cheese, meat and canned goods. In the 20 years Gloria Varney has been running her CSA this way, she has never wanted to shift to a more traditional CSA model. "It's a lot of work to put together boxes," she said. And this way, customers can choose to spend only $10 one month and $300 the next, depending on their needs.
Then there is Sara Tryzelaar, an herb farmer in Casco who makes skin-care products and tinctures and sells them through her Etsy shop and through a monthly, year-round CSA. Or as she calls it, a CSH, with herbalism standing in for the word agriculture. Tryzelaar is in her seventh year with the CSH and has between five and 30 people in it at any given time. She tailors packages to individual customer needs and to seasons. So in the spring customers get a homemade bug spray, and in the fall, something to help with the arrival of cold season.
"The cool thing about using local plants is that a lot of the plants that are ready to harvest go along with what you might need at that time of year," she said. "I just harvested elderberries over the last few weeks and am making tinctures."
As Tryzelaar notes, winter CSAs are just starting to become a bigger thing, an area of agriculture growing naturally into a void.
"I actually like to focus more on the winter as far as advertising because summers are a little crazy," she said.
At Wolf Pine Farm, the farmers took a hiatus from summer CSAs for a few years and when they tried to get back in, found the competition stiff.
"It has been really challenging to get our numbers back to where they were on the summer shares," Tom Harms said. "We celebrate the success of the movement, but it is getting more crowded."
Other farms said they too favor their winter CSAs because the off-season is so much less competitive. North Branch Farm in Monroe runs a winter share from mid-October to mid-February. They started the winter CSA in 2011 and have about 55 families who sign up regularly (they're still signing people up for 2017-8018). It made good business sense.
"There were over 20 farms in Waldo County doing summer CSAs this year and only three doing winter CSAs," said farmer Seth Yentes. "Also, I like doing the crops (for a winter CSA). They are high-calorie crops instead of light, pretty things." Vegetables like buttercup and delicata squashes.
The biggest challenges are storage and packing. "Because sometimes things freeze," Yentes said.
Sharify
The logistics can be brutal, says Harms of Wolf Pine. He might be receiving a pallet of potatoes for the alliance's CSA at the same time as he's negotiating processing chickens from his own farm.
"I spend a lot of quality time with an Excel spread sheet," he said. He tries to inventory shares as efficiently as possible for equal distributions. "Sharify. That is my verb of the day."
If that's the verb, teamwork is the noun for alliances like his at Wolf Pine. The Foot Hill Farm Alliance is comprised of five farms in Western Maine and just over the border in New Hampshire. All the farmers have connections to Tom Earle of Earle's Family Farm in Center Conway, New Hampshire, and they all contribute a little something different to the vegetable winter CSAs they've been running for about six years.
"It's more about sharing the actual crops," said Dylan Watters of Old Wells Farm. "Like we don't really have the land base to grow a lot of potatoes, but other people do. And three or four of us have high tunnels." Next week, he said, he'll be pulling out the tomatoes and planting spinach, lettuces and bok choy, all for the alliance's winter CSA. It takes a lot of planning and balancing among the five farms to pull off a group CSA, he said.
"There's a lot of teamwork involved," agrees Natalie Beittel of Hosac Farm, one of the Foot Hill Alliance Farms. They get together to discuss crops and to get boxes ready for distribution. "It is pretty fun."
But Tom Harms of Wolf Pine might have the champion of fun winter CSA distribution models. They arrange pickups of shares at craft breweries in Portland, Kittery and Lewiston. Just in case anyone needs a case of beer with their box of veg.

Full text: Harmful toxin might taint shellfish from 5 Down East dealers
Thousands of pounds of Maine shellfish are being recalled because of concerns they might be tainted with a potentially deadly marine neurotoxin.
The Department of Marine Resources issued a recall Friday of mussels harvested near Mount Desert Island from Sept. 10 to 14. Five Maine shellfish dealers are being asked to recall product.
This is only the second shellfish recall on record, said Jeff Nichols, a department spokesman. The only other recall was issued during a similar algae bloom last year.
The recall comes a day after the department's public health arm closed part of the Down East coast to shellfish harvesting after detecting elevated levels of domoic acid, a toxin produced by a large bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia phytoplankton. Shellfish such as mussels, clams and oysters eat phytoplankton and store toxin in their flesh. Domoic acid can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, which can result in illness, brain damage and memory loss. Mussel samples collected in Frenchman's Bay, between Bar Harbor and Gouldsboro, had levels of domoic acid higher than the safety threshold of 20 parts per million, the department said.
Kirk Loud, a manager at Atlantic Shellfish in Jonesport, said the company had to recall only 10 2-pound bags of mussels that were sold locally. The remaining product, about 5,000 pounds, is still at the company and will be destroyed, he said.
"As far as we are aware, nothing has seen the market," Loud said.
Maine's shellfish managers are experts at predicting red tide, another harmful algae bloom carrying a biotoxin that can cause paralysis or death. That's because red tide develops gradually and can be monitored carefully.
Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, however, are less predictable and intensify rapidly. While Pseudo-nitzschia is common in the Gulf of Maine, the first recorded toxic bloom occurred last fall and caught state officials and the shellfish industry by surprise.
Loud's impression is the department is unused to Pseudo-nitzschia blooms and is using an abundance of caution.
"This is new to them. They don't have their thumb on it yet. They want to be safe," he said.
"I am 100 percent with them on this," Loud said. "Better safe than sorry."
At Eastern Maine Mussel in Hancock on Friday afternoon, manager Ralph Robertson was trying to figure out exactly where recalled mussels were and how many would have to be destroyed. The company sells shellfish nationwide, mostly to wholesalers, Robertson said.
"Hopefully, it is still all on trucks. That would make it easier," he said. Every shellfish dealer has a protocol ready in case of a recall and can find out where the product is.
"Everything is dated, tagged and triple-checked. We have records on everything, when it was towed, packaged, shipped," Robertson said. "It is all well-documented.
Fiona de Koning, co-owner of Hollander and de Koning Mussels, did not disclose the precise amount of mussels her company had to recall, but she said it was "significant." De Koning tends five aquaculture leases around Mount Desert Island, which is at the center of the algae bloom. Most of the company's recalled mussels were still with distributors and had not reached consumers, de Koning said.
"It really is important that we can move quickly if something like that happens," de Koning said. "You want to catch it before it goes too far into the supply chain." This was de Koning's first recall, and she doesn't want to repeat the experience.
This is the second year in a row Maine has had to issue a recall because of a biotoxin scare. Last year, 5 tons of shellfish were recalled. Some product got as far as Missouri and Utah before it was returned. About 96 percent of the product was recalled, but about 430 pounds were unaccounted for.
Additional shellfish dealers who were notified of the mussel recall and are contacting their customers are Moosabec Mussels Inc. in Jonesport, Pemaquid Oyster Co. in Waldoboro and Steward GEM LLC in Bar Harbor.
The Department of Marine Resources said based on test results, mussels are the only product affected by the recall at this point. Closure areas will re-open when there are two consecutive scores from shellfish testing at least one week apart that are deemed safe, and there is a decline in the concentration of phytoplankton in the water.

Algae bloom forces suspension of shellfishing in parts of state

Full text: A marine algae bloom that can carry a potentially deadly neurotoxin has forced the suspension of shellfish harvesting in parts of Down East Maine.
The Department of Marine Resources reported Thursday that it was monitoring an active bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia, an ocean phytoplankton carrying carry domoic acid, a toxin that can cause sickness, memory loss and brain damage in humans. This is the second year in a row a toxic Pseudo-nitzschia bloom has halted shellfishing along large parts of the coast.
Before 2016, there was no record of a toxic bloom of this type in the Gulf of Maine.
The department's public health section found levels of domoic acid that exceeded health standards in shellfish tested between Mount Desert Island and Gouldsboro. That area has been closed to harvesting and the department enacted a precautionary closure from Deer Isle to Machiasport, almost a third of Maine's coastline.
Department spokesman Jeff Nichols said officials were monitoring the situation closely. There is no indication contaminated shellfish have made their way to consumers, he said.
"It is impossible to determine at this point if the concentrations of domoic acid will increase in other areas. But we know that the phytoplankton that produces it grows rapidly, so we are carefully monitoring the entire coast and will be able to rapidly detect harmful levels of domoic acid and take action to protect the health of Maine's shellfish consumers," Nichols said.
Shellfishing areas routinely are closed by the state to protect consumers from tainted product because of stormwater runoff or "red tide," another kind of algae bloom that produces a toxin known to cause paralysis or death in humans.
There is no way to tell if the current bloom is a repeat of last year, when some shellfish samples had over 100 parts per million of domoic acid, more than five times the food safety limit. That bloom triggered the a rare recall of 5 tons of shellfish and an immediate harvesting suspension on a third of the state's coastline. It took more than a month to reopen all harvesting areas.
It's not yet clear what economic effect the current closure might have.
"We don't know how the bloom is developing or how extensive it is going to be," said Steve Archer, a senior research scientist with the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay, where the state's shellfish is tested.
"It is pretty small-scale at the moment, compared to what it was, It has a long way to go to match last year's event," he said.
Blooms can be triggered by a variety of environmental factors, and it is unknown if this event was caused by the same species of Pseudo-nitzschia as last year, he added.
Domoic acid, the toxin produced by Pseudo-nitzschia, is stored in shellfish tissue and can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, or ASP, if ingested. In a three-decade-old case from Prince Edward Island, two people died after eating shellfish tainted with domoic acid. Areas of the West Coast periodically undergo intense Pseudo-nitzschia blooms that have killed marine birds and mammals and caused extended closures of important fisheries such as razor clams and Dungeness crabs.
Fiona de Koning, co-owner of Hollander and de Koning mussels, spent Thursday morning calling customers to tell them about the closure. The company has five aquaculture leases around Mount Desert Island and Deer Isle. Currently, only one is outside the harvesting ban, de Koning said.
The Department of Marine Resources "has rigorous standards they stick to. That is why people have high confidence of the seafood from Maine," De Koning said. "They know it is safe and healthy and they can enjoy it.
"Our customers like to have a consistent supply; of course it is not ideal, but they understand."
Maine's shellfish monitors are experts at predicting toxic "red tide" blooms. In the spring and summer, when red tide typically blooms, state monitors conduct weekly water and shellfish flesh tests at about 80 sites in the state to test for elevated phytoplankton and toxin. Following the unexpected Pseudo-nitzschia bloom last September, the department updated protocols to monitor for a similar event and prevent another shellfish recall.
De Koning said she's never had a red tide closure, but her mussel farms, and at least two dozen other aquaculture leases for oysters and mussels are at the epicenter of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms for two years. It's a new problem, but uncertainty is part of farming shellfish, she said.
"This is just one of those things that happens when you are working with nature," de Koning said.
"Whatever nature throws at us we have to adapt to and learn from."

Full text: Zapoteca owners Shannon, Tom Bard being sued by vendors who say they weren't paid after restaurant closed
Celebrated chef Shannon Bard and her husband are facing at least a dozen lawsuits from vendors who say the couple left a trail of unpaid bills when they closed Zapoteca, their popular Portland restaurant, in June.
The restaurant was among the most highly regarded in Portland, and Bard was well known even beyond Maine, with appearances on cooking competition shows on the Food Network and a cookbook published two years ago. The restaurant operated on Fore Street for six years, but the couple said they decided to close it and concentrate on a restaurant and cooking school in their hometown of Kennebunk so they could spend more time with their children, who are in high school and college.
They made no mention of the lawsuits filed in Cumberland County courts that suggest increasing financial pressures on the restaurant starting last fall.
The suits paint a picture of Bard that is starkly at odds with her national reputation as an acclaimed restaurateur who has cooked at the world-famous James Beard House in New York.
In November, Independent Restaurant Supply of Portland, which sells silverware, furniture and kitchen equipment to restaurants, filed suit against the Bards, claiming it was owed $6,000 by Bard Enterprises, the parent company of Zapoteca.
In the suit, the company said Zapoteca had ordered supplies from the company through 2013 and after that made only occasional payments, "which ended in June 2015 along with any communication regarding their outstanding balance."
Dan Bornstein, the manager of the supply company, said he doesn't know the current status of the suit and declined to comment.
Shannon Bard did not return multiple messages left for her over two weeks at Toroso, her restaurant in Kennebunk. Several other numbers listed for her or Tom Bard had either been disconnected or went unanswered. The phone numbers that were still working gave no option to leave voicemail messages.
Responding to a message left at Toroso, Tom Bard, who operates Bard Enterprises, spoke briefly to the Portland Press Herald, playing down the couple's financial difficulties.
"We're working with everybody" to settle the bills, he said. "Closing down a restaurant is never an easy thing to do."
Bard said Zapoteca was "a good, strong, profitable restaurant," and suggested that some of the financial problems they have experienced stemmed from Mixteca, the restaurant the two operated in New Hampshire.
"Everything kind of got pushed up from there," he said before ending the phone interview.
"We're basically working through it, and that's all I've got to say about it," Bard said.
The lawsuits are at odds with Shannon Bard's reputation as a restaurateur in Portland and even national restaurant circles. The consistently well-reviewed Zapoteca, with its creative Mexican dishes, was considered a relative rarity in a city with a growing restaurant scene, but still known primarily for its seafood.
Bard also rose to popular fame through television cooking appearances. In 2014, Bard took home the top prize -- and a $25,000 check -- from the Food Network show, "Kitchen Inferno." The year before, she also gained exposure, but no title, when she faced off with Food Network star chef Bobby Flay in his TV series "Beat Bobby Flay."
She also cooked at the James Beard House in New York in 2014, considered a top honor by the nation's leading foundation focused on restaurants and cuisine. The foundation lauded Zapoteca as "an unlikely oasis of vibrant Mexican flavor in the hardy wilds of Maine."
Chefs are invited to cook -- "perform," in the James Beard Foundation's words -- based on their national or regional reputation and their knowledge and use of seasonal and/or local ingredients, among other factors. At her dinner, Bard prepared, among other dishes, a lobster, scallop and mussel chilpachole with a Maine oyster broth reduction and adobo glazed duck breast with cranberry-nut mole.
Izabela Wojcik, director of house programming for the Beard Foundation, said Bard's menu was "quite elegant."
Bard's dishes were "replete with regional Mexican dishes, but seen through a seasonal lens that highlighted the Maine bounty," she said. "It represented an opportunity to showcase a restaurant and chef and an exciting cuisine that we felt would be of interest to our guests."
Bard's cookbook, "The Gourmet Mexican Kitchen," came out the next year, but there were signs at the time Bards were concerned about finances.
In 2013, the Bards began to look for a space to open a second restaurant in Portland, although Tom Bard complained that finding affordable space in the city was close to impossible and the restaurant did not expand in the city.
Other creditors who have filed suit include a natural gas supplier, which says it is owed nearly $13,000, with court costs; Micucci's, an Italian grocer in Portland, which said the restaurant owes it nearly $900, with additional costs for its attempts to collect the money; a restaurant supply company, which says its $6,000 bill hasn't been paid; a food service company, which said it has an unpaid bill for slightly more than $10,000; and Republicash, a check cashing and payday loan company, which filed suit for $9,000 after it said the restaurant's paychecks to employees bounced.
Many of the suits were filed this spring and summer, while others date even further back, including one in which a New Hampshire landlord claims to be owed more than $70,000 for a restaurant named Mixteca that Bard operated in Durham, New Hampshire, and closed in January. That debt is impinging on Tom and Shannon Bard's private life, with a lien placed on the couple's 227-year-old, $440,000 house near downtown Kennebunk.
Casco View Holdings III, the landlord of the building that housed the Portland restaurant, also filed suit against Zapoteca, claiming the restaurant failed to pay its rent in January. The rent was more than $6,600 a month, with taxes, trash collection fees, water bills and a late fee pushing the tab to more than $10,000 a month.
Sergio Ramos, the former manager of Zapoteca, also has filed suit against the restaurant, saying the company hasn't paid him in line with the terms of his $50,000-a-year contract, which also had a provision that would allow him to buy a piece of the business, with increasing amounts depending on how long he worked there. The lawyer handling the suit for the former manager said the dispute has been ordered into arbitration and he declined to discuss the details.
Several of the lawsuits against the Bards were resolved as default judgments because the Bards did not show up to contest them. Other suits were filed as recently as three weeks ago and hearings have not yet been held.
Some of the suits illustrate how the amount owed can grow when companies have to go to court to settle an unpaid bill.
For instance, Agera Energy, the restaurant's natural gas supplier, filed suit after it claimed the Bards failed to pay a bill for $8,081. Interest added more than $1,700 to the tab, plus $3,000 for attorney's fees, for a total of $12,803.72. The lien filed by 6 Jenkins Court, the New Hampshire landlord of the restaurant there, is accruing interest at a rate of nearly 7 percent.
Kelly McDonald, the lawyer handling that suit for the New Hampshire company, declined to comment.
Trimark United, a food service and equipment supplier, said it is owed $10,007.90 by the Bards. That company's suit also alleges that Tom Bard changed a section in the credit agreement between the company and Bard, crossing out information indicating that the couple owned their house in Kennebunk and instead, writing that the house was rented, possibly an attempt to shield it if the company sought to collect any unpaid bills by putting a lien on the house. Trimark United's suit against the Bards indicates that the company is seeking half the value of the house, or $220,000, as a punitive measure.
Steve Hewins, president of the Maine Restaurant Association, declined to discuss Zapoteca or the Bards' situation, but said running a restaurant requires mastering a range of skills, not all of them compatible, that make it an especially difficult business to manage.
"Generally, the public would not really understand how complex running a restaurant is," Hewins said.
He noted that restaurateurs need to be skilled at managing an inventory of perishable supplies that need to be handled, stored and prepared in a safe manner.
In addition, a restaurant needs to be inviting and ready to accommodate the needs and desires of a range of customers, from people who eat out almost nightly to those for whom it's an occasional treat.
"You're hosting a dinner party every night," Hewins said. "You have to manage a wide spectrum of people who come in each night."
The duties also include managing a staff, which is particularly difficult now due to labor shortages in the state, especially in the summer. Restaurants have to pass frequent inspections by health officials. And finally, Hewins said, a restaurateur has to be creative enough to cook food that people want to eat and able to adapt to changing public tastes while putting in very long hours.
"I have great respect for the people that operate restaurants because most of the owners are in the store" juggling all those roles, he said.

Full text: Paul Naron whips out his measuring tape. Is that vendor with the popsicles infringing on unpaid territory, creeping past his or her rented 4 feet of booth space? Trailed by his assistant, Maddie Newton, he prowls the United Farmers Market of Maine like a smallish tiger in shorts, baseball cap and a hardware store apron.
He gives a running commentary of the unmanned booths as he goes; it's midweek and the market is only open on Saturdays. This vendor with the woodsie geegaws hasn't sold much and probably won't be around much longer, Naron says, but that's OK -- Naron and Newton are four to five people deep in prospective vendors eager to get into what Naron says is already the best indoor market in Maine. His ambition is for it to be the best indoor farmers market in the world -- never mind that Belfast has a population of fewer than 7,000 -- and Naron is thrumming with the excitement of someone who senses an impossible goal might be attainable after all.
"These guys have a llama farm," Naron says, waving the measuring tape at another booth.
"Alpaca," Newton corrects, softly. She just graduated from Unity College in May, within days of the opening of Naron's dream market, and has been helping him manage vendors, details and his streak of perfectionism since then.
Naron stops at Fancy Plants, a plant-based food stall. "My girlfriend is addicted to this stuff," Naron says, rapping the measuring tape on the counter. The chalkboard sign says "Gluten free, dairy free, sugar free."
Addiction possibilities seem limited, at least to us. "Trust me," he says.
How's the Nitro coffee sold at the Farm House Coffee Roasters stand, the trendy stuff infused with nitrogen? "I can't drink coffee," he said.
When Kate Hall of Graze Maine, a Northport microgreens producer, was considering applying to be a vendor at the United Farmers Market, she got a tour from Naron himself.
His style is hands-on, even if it means driving two hours to convince a farmer to rent a booth (rates start at $31.50 a month for a 4-foot space) or being inside when he could be out sailing.
Hall was new in the business, with less than a year under her belt, although already she was selling to restaurants, including Suzuki's Sushi Bar in Rockland and Natalie's at Camden Harbour Inn.
"He made this comment to me, like he'd see me 'when you get your act together,'" Hall remembered. She could have taken it as an insult, but instead, it felt like a challenge. "And I just looked at him. And I was like 'Yeah, I have got my act together.'"
The exchange established a connection. "I really like Paul," Hall says.
"He just wants to make sure that we are all as invested in this as he is," she added. "I have a lot of appreciation for what he has done as a businessman and for the local farmers. Not many people would invest so much money in other people and in the community this way that he has."
Naron, 67, is a Baltimore native who made a tidy living with a hardware chain in southeast Florida. He started with a staff of four and sold the business when it had expanded to over 100 employees. About eight years ago, he bought a house in Belfast, a place he knew from sailing and had come to like very much. The house he bought was on a corner and had a great view of Belfast Bay. To the left of it and just across the street was an old window factory belonging to Mathews Brothers, which has been manufacturing windows in Belfast since 1854. They were using the 1980s building, which isn't much to look at from the outside, as a showroom, but the factory was elsewhere in town, out on Perkins Road.
The building was for sale, and Naron eyed it. It came with about an acre of land. It seemed suited to some sort of retail business. Those were skills he already had. He knew what a commercial property this size (30,000 square feet) would go for in booming Portland down the coast. "I was staring at this building," he said. He made an offer. They didn't bite. He kept staring.
One of Naron's earliest memories is going to Lexington Market in Baltimore with his grandfather and watching fishmongers shucking oysters. As an adult, he visited indoor markets in Canada, including one in Frederictown, New Brunswick, that struck him as an indoor market done right. He is a believer in buying both lettuce at the farmers market, and a nice lunch, and then eating the lunch in a place with a view.
As Naron mulled over a growing vision of an indoor market like that, in Belfast, he reached out to townspeople and farmers and managers at the Belfast Farmers Market.
"He came to us five or six years ago," Anne Segeese, the manager of the Belfast Farmers Market, which is on Fridays, is 37 years old and also runs year-round, moving to a greenhouse in Belfast's Aubuchon Hardware store from November to April. "He always references one up in Canada. He even sponsored a field trip up there and took a couple of market managers," she said.
"We all got to know each other pretty well," Segeese added.
But by the time Naron made another offer on the Mathews Brothers building, the one that was accepted, they'd made up their minds. "In the end, we decided to decline his offer and the primary reason was that it would be his gig. He called the shots."
Meaning, longstanding rules, typical at farmers markets, about say, the vendors also being the producers, could be put aside. The Belfast Farmers Market operates as a democracy, with committees discussing and voting on changes. They didn't want a boss, no matter how generous.
But the new market, Segeese says, is "beautiful."
"It is a great asset to Belfast," she said. Not that there weren't anxieties about competition and duplication. She'd have rather that Naron chose a different name. He changed it from the United Farmers Market of Belfast to the United Farmers Market of Maine, but the website is still belfastmarket.com. There's been enough confusion that the Belfast Farmers Market rebranded itself in many materials as "the original market serving Belfast."
"We needed some way to say, 'Hey, we are still here,' " Segeese said. "I had a city councilor say to me, 'I heard you guys are moving over to Mathews Brothers!'" So far the markets seem to have a different customer base, Segeese said, with Naron's market making a lot of people who can't ditch work on Friday to shop happy.
It's also appealing to new vendors. Kate Hall was ready to expand her customer base for Graze, but traditional farmers markets weren't that appealing to her. "Because I didn't have time to break down and set up."
Ditto for Lou Harris, the farmer behind Abraham's Cheesery.
"We never really did farmers markets," Harris said of his Newport goat farm, which produces goat meat, milk, cheese and yogurt. The beauty of his 8-foot booth in Belfast is that the freezer and refrigerator case stay put. Convenient and "so much cleaner," Harris said. "You are not reaching into a cooler full of dirty ice to get your product out."
"It's a totally different beast," Segeese said. She hopes that Naron keeps the place thriving, long after the summer tourists are gone; no hard feelings, she said.
"It was not all fruits and rainbows, but we're cool," she said.

The very same day Naron closed on the Mathews Brothers building, he ordered windows for a 3,000-square-foot corner of it, the one that faces the bay, same view as his house basically but mostly hidden (the window factory had had some windows, but small ones). Now shoppers can sit at the tables and watch the boat traffic in Belfast Bay.
"This is really where it all started," Naron said, resting -- briefly -- on one of the tables he built himself for the room, borrowing the model from the ones chef Erin French built for The Lost Kitchen in nearby Freedom. "To make this room."
When he was driving around to farms and inviting vendors to come visit, he used the room as a lure. A room with a view, where people would not sit with their laptops or phones (in Naron's world, a hugely disappointing social evolution) but rather, with each other.
"I wouldn't have done it without this room, this place where people can break bread together and have this beautiful view," he said, "because that is the soul of the place."
The transformation from the real estate closing to the market's opening day in late May was only about 18 months, he said. But he's far from done. What you see at the market is only half the building's capacity, and he's busy mapping out a commercial kitchen and possibly an event center in those hidden spaces (the Belfast Maskers rented the space for its production of "Annie" this summer).
"There might be a world-class restaurant here at some point," he said, mentioning chefs from top Maine restaurants who he said were interested in opening a restaurant together in Belfast. "But I'm not counting on that."
Even on a down day in early August, the United Farmers Market of Maine was filled with activity. Workmen were delivering the equipment for a hydroponic growing station that Kate Hall will help oversee ("We want to be able to show people things growing," Naron said). Downstairs, off the loading dock, artist David Hurley was putting the finishing touches on a 24-foot-tall lettuce leaf (his carrot was already up), and then an Amish couple showed up.
Mary and Levi Miller had taken both bus and taxi to get from Sherman to Belfast. They had an appointment to see Naron, to show him their traditional baskets. With the help of the taxi driver who had brought them on the last leg, they set up their wares in the room with the windows.
But problematically, they were looking for someone who could sell their goods for them. It would never be feasible to take public transport on a three-hour journey each direction every Saturday morning.
Naron was nonplussed. "I love the look," he said under his breath. Mary and Levi Miller were in full Amish garb, from bonnet to breeches. Naron examined the baskets. He picked up potholders that cost just a few dollars. He pushed a woven basket that was also a lazy Susan and watched it spin. "I love lazy Susans," he said.
When things go wrong at the market, like when the fish guy's freezer stopped working, Hall said Naron typically steps in to buy whatever has been lost. Or in some cases, the extras "That has happened more than once."
With the Millers looking on, their likely three-hour journey home ahead of them, and no future at the United Farmers Market of Maine ahead of them (the place is humming with technology; not exactly Amish country). Naron began to pile up potholders onto a lazy Susan, wondering aloud, would the lazy Susans work in this room? Did they go with anything?
Not really. But he sent Newton off to cut the Millers a check. He'd buy a few things anyway. "The least I can do is pay for your cab ride," he said.

Full text: Thornton Academy program helps find jobs for graduates, fill hole in workforce
Tom Teague had never been inside a factory until his Thornton Academy class toured Pratt & Whitney's North Berwick plant, which, among other things, makes parts for some of the most sophisticated aircraft in the world, including Lockheed Martin's fifth-generation F-35 and F-22 fighter jets. Now, he's working at the plant following an internship at Pratt & Whitney in collaboration with Saco-based Thornton, an independent school serving grades 6 through 12.
The 2-year-old internship program at Thornton, the first in the country to use a hands-on curriculum developed by a machinists' association, is trying to find good jobs for its graduates and fill a gaping hole in Maine's workforce.
Teague, who now works full time for the company, isn't as intimidated as he was the first time he stepped through Pratt & Whitney's doors as a student.
"When I first started, I was scared to come into a huge machine shop," he said. "This is my first job. I'm glad I did it."
Thornton's program combines an online curriculum from the National Tooling & Machining Association, or NTMA, with hands-on experience at Pratt & Whitney and other Maine manufacturers, including Yale Cordage and Arundel Machine Tool, to expose students to options of a career in manufacturing -- an area in which Maine needs skilled labor. Pratt & Whitney, which has 1,700 employees, has more than 50 positions open in North Berwick, while the state as a whole has more than 700 positions open in all aspects of manufacturing, according to the job site Indeed.com.
It's a business segment that is critical to the state's economic health, contributing $5.1 billion in economic output and accounting for about 9 percent of Maine's gross state product, according to the Maine 2015 Manufacturing Summit Report. Some 1,775 factories employ more than 54,900 individuals, according to the Maine Department of Labor. The average annual salary for workers in manufacturing was $66,653, according to 2014 State Manufacturing Data figures.
Thornton was the first high school in the country to adopt the NTMA curriculum, which was targeted at workers already in the field who wanted to hone their skills and adapted for students.
"Parents see jobs in manufacturing as a career-limiting step," said Russ Chaput, human resources manager at Pratt & Whitney. "Here (in Maine) there aren't many jobs you can come to without a university degree and still grow and learn and make a salary to live."
Teague's classmate Nick Claesson is also a Pratt & Whitney employee now.
"I thought of factories as having smoke under the ceilings," he said before he toured the facility. "This one was different than I imagined."
Like Teague, Claesson said he's glad he chose a manufacturing career. "There's a lot of opportunity at Pratt & Whitney. I found a career, not just a job," said Claesson, who worked part time at a Market Basket supermarket while he was in high school. "I have income, benefits, a comfortable living in the future and a full career here."
Not that there aren't challenges. Claesson acknowledges the military line grinders, which sheer off extra metal from the fine parts for the jets, can be nerve wracking to operate.
"The grinders are a high-volume unit for military and commercial use," said Ron Enders, operations manager at Pratt & Whitney, who helped oversee Claesson and Teague as interns and now as employees. "They take large hunks of exotic metals and turn them into parts for jet engines that you see at airports or in the F-35 and F-22 fighter jets. The grinders remove metal by abrading versus cutting. Some materials are so hard you can't cut them with the CNC (computer numerical control) lathe. It will destroy your machine."
Claesson said the NMTA class did cover metallurgy, the study of the physical and chemical behavior of metals and metallic compounds, to prepare for the production work.
"The hardest part of the job is the standard of quality because it can be a very tight tolerance," said Claesson, referencing the machine work.
Enders said the company has more than 100 different job codes, offering a lot of opportunity to employees to advance or try something different.
The North Berwick factory is 1 million square feet, making it the largest manufacturer in Maine, according to Chaput. The company's headquarters are in East Hartford, Connecticut, and overall revenue was about $14 billion in 2015. It is a subsidiary of United Technologies (NYSE: UTX), a $56 billion aircraft maker based in Farmington, Connecticut.
Of the 10 Thornton students who enrolled in the first NMTA program and performed internships, all 10 graduated and have internships, jobs or went to college, said Rene Menard, headmaster of Thornton. The program requires students to commit to six semesters, with classes meeting about 80 minutes daily or about 300 hours per semester in the sophomore, junior and senior years to total 1,800 hours.
There also are labs. To get a job, typically starting in machine tooling, the students must first graduate from Thornton and be 18 years old.
"It's a public relations challenge because there is a perception that manufacturing is dead," said Menard. "We did marketing to change that perspective. We said there are highly skilled manufacturing jobs in Maine and there's a gap filling them. So we went out to visit companies like Pratt & Whitney, Arundel and Yale Cordage."
Some 100 students at Thornton were interested in getting into the competitive NTMA and internship program, said Allan Young, an administrator at the school. "We looked at their math and science skills, attendance and other factors and whether they had what it takes to complete the program," he said.
That also includes the soft skills of learning to work with others with different backgrounds, experience levels and genders. Tom Narciso, who teaches at Thornton and at Southern Maine Community College, helps with both the student labs and the knowledge of the soft skills.
"Precision manufacturing is what this is all about," he said. "Anyone who endeavors to be in this trade needs to use math, geometry and have a work ethic. It's not for everyone."
However, those who pursue the job can get $10-$15 an hour out of high school and $20 an hour after four or five years. They can rise rapidly, with a 30-year tool maker earning up to $40 an hour, Narciso said.
The demand is not expected to lessen in the near future as older workers in manufacturing are nearing retirement age, just as they are in other industries in Maine where the average age is 43.8, the oldest in the nation.
"Baby boomers are retiring out of manufacturing. We won't have the numbers to do the labor," said Narciso. "In another decade, the world will be their (young employees') oyster."
Not all students come out of the internships clearly fixed on a career in machine tooling and manufacturing. Sarah Picard, who also was in the first NMTA class of Thornton students, thought she wanted to go into the trades because her dad is an electrician. But she's now studying at the University of Maine in Orono and toggling between art education and engineering.
"I can't picture myself doing machining full time," said Picard, who interned at Yale Cordage. "But I would get into machining and then later be a teacher or own an art studio."
Still, she said she liked the class at Thornton and the help from teachers.
"This is a good opportunity. There is high demand for machinists, especially in Maine. Trades are a good thing to get into," she said. "There aren't a lot of girls in this industry. But at Yale Cordage they taught me that it doesn't matter that I'm a girl. They taught me a lot."
Narciso said the demand for precision manufacturing jobs will remain high because they are integrated into many different kinds of industries, such as medical device manufacturing and ship and boat building. The NMTA is an innovative way to introduce students into a career path, he said.
"Thornton isn't afraid of innovative things. They deserve kudos."

Full text: MAINE ISLANDS ARE very special but challenging places to live year-round. In the last 100 years we've gone from 300 to just 15 year-round island communities.
So we're especially fortunate to have the Island Institute, which focuses much of its attention on island issues and challenges. I love the institute's regular Working Waterfront newspaper, which I receive online, and I learned a lot from their interesting stories in the new edition of their magazine, Island Journal.
In the new edition, I particularly enjoyed Howie Montenko's astonishing photos, using a technique known as "light painting." He assembles a crew of islanders at dusk to shine handheld flashlights that "paint" the scene with light while Monteko creates a long-exposure photo. They are absolutely stunning.
The list of island challenges is lengthy, from no broadband and extremely high energy costs to rising tides and warming oceans to maintaining schools and year-round jobs. Thankfully, the Island Institute is working on all of these challenges.
I've been intrigued by some of their initiatives to bring efficient energy to the islands. Their Energy Planning for Island Communities Initiative is providing technical resources and tools to communities to help achieve their clean energy goals.
In July of last year experts from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory met with energy leaders and community members on Isle au Haut and Monhegan islands to learn about their priorities and identify cost-effective ways for those islands to transition to clean energy systems. Island Institute also crated the Spark! Fund, a competitive grant program providing awards of up to $2,000 for island and coastal energy projects.
The institute's Aquaculture Business Development Program is helping aspiring seaweed and shellfish farmers get started. Nine new businesses were launched in the first year of this program. In the next five years they expect this project to have an $8.3 million impact on Maine's economy.
And I have a friend working in Frenchboro on Long Island as an Island Fellow. The institute has many fellows working on our islands in a variety of jobs and projects, including schools, energy efficiency, town management, fire and safety, elder care, and more.
Their educational programs are very important, including Outer Islands Teaching and Learning Collaborative, scholarships and Island Scholars Network, and Distance Learning Technology. In the latter program, they partnered with tech company EPlus in 2009 and again in 2014 to secure significant USDA-Rural Development grant funds to install cutting-edge teleconferencing and video recording equipment at 24 sites, including Maine's island and remote coastal schools and other rural coastal community schools in Alaska and St. John, Virgin Islands. The equipment allows for highly interactive networking among students and connects them to resources at universities and other educational organizations. Wonderful!
Maine's islands are life-changing places for many. If you read the Travelin' Maine(rs) columns that Linda and I write, you know we love Monhegan island. In the new edition of the Island Journal, there's a great interview with Mott Feibusch, a young man who first visited Monhegan in the summer of 1990 and moved there to live year-round in 2015. When asked if he had a favorite story or memory of Maine, this is what Mott said.
"I visited Monhegan for the first time in winter about 10 years ago. I made frames and painted with the artist Ted Tihansky for a couple of weeks. During that time, there was a blizzard on the island, and we ate fresh shrimp from a five-gallon bucket. We also had a Valentine's dinner for 12 people, hiked out to Burnt Head and painted the moon rising on found pieces of tile, made bracelets of discarded copper pipe, and torched sculptures and frames chasing an aesthetic unique to Ted. It was a great introduction to the community I had known from only one perspective. Without that experience, I wouldn't be the person I am today."
Today, Mott is the island's third assessor and assistant fire chief. He works for the power company, pours beer at the island's wonderful brewery, and owns a woodworking business. With his partner, Carley Mayhew, Monhegan's postmaster, Mott is now roasting coffee, hoping to turn that into a year-round business. Yup, year-round residency on our islands requires lots of jobs.

Full text: AS A LOBSTERMAN for more than 30 years, I have a direct connection to the ocean and its abundance. It's how I make my living, and I've seen it shape my way of life and the people around me. Fishing and seafood are an inextricable part of Maine's heritage and culture, and it's thanks to good conservation practices in the lobster fishery that we enjoy the bounty reflected in our record landings of late.
But keeping this way of life requires a continuation of good decision-making now -- not only for the health of our ocean, but also for the health of Mainers and our economy. Cutting carbon emissions is an imperative element of that, and we can't settle for either the status quo or a return to the times and policies that paid little heed to the environment around us.
One program on the state and regional level that has shown great success already, but now faces an imminent decision on its future, is the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. After a 20-month review, a choice must be made on the amount of carbon reduction required -- which directly translates into protecting Maine's people and resources.
Maine is one of nine states (along with Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont) that participate in an interstate cap-and-invest system that limits carbon dioxide emissions from power companies and allows them to buy and sell permits for the emissions they create. The revenue from auctioning off these permits is put to work to further reduce emissions, providing funding for energy-efficiency programs and helping pay power bills.
RGGI has been an unparalleled success -- it's a shining example of how states can lead the way to low carbon-based economies. When initiated in 2009, doomsayers predicted huge jumps in the cost of power, lost jobs and a faltering economy. Instead, RGGI has:
[bullet] Grown regional employment by more than 30,000 job-years.
[bullet] Reduced electricity rates in member states by 3.4 percent (while the price grew in non-RGGI states).
[bullet] Contributed to 25 percent growth in member state economies (again outpacing non- RGGI states).
[bullet] Saved utility customers $618 million on their energy bills to date, with billions more expected over these measures' lifetimes.
[bullet] Provided public health benefits valued at $5.7 billion (and that's just the estimated benefit from the reduction in CO2; other illness-causing pollution has been cut as well).
[bullet] Reduced carbon pollution from power plants by 40 percent (outperforming the rest of the country).
These results speak for themselves. But for me, cutting carbon is more personal: It's very real and is essential for protecting our oceans. About 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed by the ocean, and the resulting chemical reactions cause ocean acidification. Acidification, as the video "A Climate Calamity in the Gulf of Maine Part 2" shows, is especially harmful to creatures with shells. This means oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, crab and, yes, lobsters, too.
Research indicates that the Gulf of Maine is particularly vulnerable to acidification. It's also warming 99 percent faster than the rest of the world's oceans (carbon pollution carries the blame there as well). It's time for seafood lovers to speak up to ensure that the abundance we've enjoyed for so long continues.
While scientists are exploring ways to adapt to our changing waters, we have to address the root cause: carbon emissions. RGGI is the best tool that Maine has to do this. The decision that's up for debate is whether RGGI's cap will continue to decline at only 2.5 percent annually, or whether we adopt more ambitious caps of up to 3.5 percent a year from 2021 through 2030. The difference could mean an extra 99 million short tons of carbon eliminated by 2030. That's more than a year's worth of emissions for the region at a cost to utilities of less than one-tenth of a penny per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Why wouldn't we jump at such a cost-effective chance to reduce emissions?
Unbelievably, Maine is one of the states balking at the higher cap, even though the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative subsidizes our electricity rates, making them the lowest in New England. Now is the time to speak up for the health of our ocean, our people, and our economy. RGGI's cap should increase to 3.5 percent annually, getting us closer to our climate policy goals and ensuring that the Maine way of life continues for generations to come.

Uncle Sam is spending millions on Maine's wild blueberries

Full text: ancy McBrady, the executive director of the Wild Blueberry Association of North America, stood in the kitchen at Fork Food Lab in Portland watching chefs from national restaurant chains (such as Applebee's) and food service corporate kitchens (such as Sysco) compete to make the best dish from a box full of Maine ingredients. The star was wild blueberries, both fresh and frozen, and all around the commercial kitchen, 10 chefs were pureeing, sauteeing and garnishing with Maine's tiny native berry.
Meanwhile, McBrady was speaking frankly about trouble in the wild blueberry business.
"The industry is actually facing a lot of difficulty right now," McBrady said, listing off a series of factors, particularly a glut of frozen berries, that have led to such depressed prices that farmers are taking huge losses. Some berries may be left on the vines as a result; the Passamaquoddy Wild Blueberry Company, which has 1,000 acres of wild blueberries on tribal land and typically harvests about 7 million pounds, announced it will skip this year's harvest. The stark reality is that some of these farmers might spend more harvesting than they would make on the crop, and that's assuming they could even find a buyer.
Just a month ago, the United States Department of Agriculture agreed to buy $10 million worth of the 2017 crop - the third year in a row and the fourth time in six years that the federal government will subsidize the state's wild blueberry growers. And at a good rate; last year the government paid between 96 cents and $1.24 per pound, more than three times the amount growers received from processors.
Despite the need for that subsidy, the participating chefs at late July event at Fork Food Lab had spent the previous two days dining out at top Portland restaurants, including Vinland (lunch at Eventide would come after the competition), touring an organic blueberry farm in Dresden and a seaweed farm in Casco Bay, all courtesy of the Wild Blueberry Association of North America's marketing and promotion budget. The night before they'd ordered everything on Scale's menu. Now they had 90 minutes to pull together an entree using lobster, pureed seaweed, oyster mushrooms, local ginger, cornmeal and of course, wild Maine blueberries.
"What you're seeing is the yin and yang of wild blueberries," McBrady said.
The yin, she said, is the association's work on behalf of the commodity, lobbying the government to buy a crop growers are having trouble selling. The yang is building a future market for a berry that is so geographically specific - in America it grows in great swaths of commercially harvestable land only in Maine - that it remains an unknown to many consumers and to decision makers in the food service industry. Hence events like this one, which the association had labeled "Eating on the Wild Side," intended to emphasize the intensity of the wild blueberries flavor as well as its health benefits of wild blueberries, which research from the USDA has shown have twice the antioxidant power - disease fighting! alleviating aging issues! - of conventional high bush blueberries. Working with Westbrook-based Ethos Marketing & Design, the commission has made strides in consumer awareness in recent years, quadrupling traffic to its website (wildblueberries.com), getting more than 6,000 mentions in national mainstream media in 2016 and more than 320,000 Facebook likes, up sixfold since 2013.
"While we are working really hard to find short-term relief, if you will, with the bonus buy," McBrady said, referring to the USDA's purchasing program. "The yang to that is that we are doing thoughtful outreach to the trades and through marketing efforts like this," McBrady added. "We have to be thinking broadly."
Every commodity requires marketing, but arguably, the Maine wild blueberry is in particular need of a fierce campaign to reach consumers. It faces stiff competition from Canada, where the bulk of the world's wild blueberries grow naturally. Maine growers have worked hard to improve their yields, and in recent years the state's 44,000 acres of blueberry fields have produced just over 100 million pounds annually. Crops have been good, but to the north, where the weak Canadian dollar means berries can be purchased more cheaply for American markets, yields have also improved at the same time as growers have expanded their growing regions.
While wild blueberries are native crops, clearing land for them allow the plants to spread, thus expanding farms. In Quebec alone, yields had been between 70 and 80 million pounds annually, according to David Yarborough, a wild blueberry specialist with the University of Maine Cooperative Extension who works as a consultant to the Wild Blueberry Association of North America. Newly cleared fields in Quebec led to a 126 million pound yield in 2016, a more than 50 percent increase. That's a major reason for the glut.
So too is the availability of conventional blueberries - from cultivated high bush plants - on the market, Yarborough said. So many are coming in from areas like the Pacific Northwest that he said 400 million pounds of the American grown high bush blueberries end up frozen annually. Since wild blueberries don't travel well fresh, the Maine crop that leaves the state is almost entirely processed and flash frozen, thus frozen conventional berries are direct competition.
The larger Maine growers, some of whom also have fields in Canada, like Wyman's, still have product left in their freezers from the last growing season, despite last year's USDA buy-back program, which took 11.7 million pounds, ultimately valued at $12.2 million. The berries were delivered to every state but Alaska, Hawaii and Rhode Island in 2016. Then state agencies distributed them to food bank networks locally, according to a USDA spokesman.
Because of that glut, Yarborough said, Maine growers decided to cut back on production this year. Whereas typically they'd bring in 50 million hives of honeybees to assist with pollination - and even in some years, up to 80 million - this year Maine growers rented 27 million hives in anticipation of another tough year for sales. "The hives are expensive," he said.
Yarborough expects with fewer pollinators and a wet, cold spring that made spraying for pests a challenge, this year's crop will be 25 percent smaller than last year's.
That's not a bad thing though, given the market. Ten years ago, farmers got about $1 per pound, last year prices hovered under 30 cents, about 20 cents less per pound than it costs to grow them.
"Having a large crop again is probably not good, at least not until we can get the demand back up," Yarborough said.
To avoid such losses, the Passamaquoddy tribe announced it wouldn't be harvesting this year; typically they sell to Cherryfield Foods Inc., but Cherryfield told the tribe in February that it would not be buying from Passamaquoddy Wild Blueberry Co. (The tribe is suing for breach of contract.) "We were totally blindsided," said Brian Altvater, the president of the tribe's blueberry company. He said typically about 600 local rakers harvest about 7 million pounds. "It's a real hit to the local economy." Are other blueberry growers mowing their fields, rather than harvesting? "That's an unknown," Yarborough said. He's heard from a few others having trouble, and at this point in the season, he said finding buyers is unlikely. "If they are smaller growers without contracts, then they probably aren't going to sell them."
"You could do some fresh market but if you aren't set up for it, there are really not a lot of good alternatives."
USDA has been assisting producers of agricultural crops since the 1930s with what are known as "emergency removals" and distributed as "bonuses." Up until 2012, the USDA had never swooped in to buy Maine wild blueberries, despite major fluctuations in prices (in 2002, farmers were getting 28 cents a pound, for instance; in 2007, they went for $1 a pound, but by 2009 they'd dropped to 36 cents).
But in that 2012 growing season, Maine's Washington delegation helped lobby for a 10-million pound buy, ultimately valued at $15.6 million. The next fiscal year, USDA bought $14 million worth of Maine blueberries. Last year the federal government spent $298 million on emergency removals of mostly fruits, vegetables and meat products, so wild blueberries were just, pardon the expression, a drop in the bucket. In the 2015 season, a freeze reduced yields in Canada, so there was no need for federal assistance.
But with this year's announcement of another buyback, is relying on USDA for an infusion of cash to the growers becoming a habit?
"I certainly do not want this to be a long-term strategy," McBrady said. "I mean, no one does. I do think that in a situation where we haven't found the right footing between supply and demand, there is a federal resource that is meant for a situation like this, to support American agriculture. And we should at least request it and see if they come through."
Those requests have been backed by the entire Maine Congressional delegation, she said. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, who represents the 2nd Congressional District, where most of the blueberry farms are, is "a wonderful advocate," McBrady said. "He was on board the moment we told him we were thinking about pursuing this, and he helped with outreach to USDA."
"If we need to ask for a few more bonus buys, we will," she said. "But I don't anticipate, once we crawl out of this, that we will ask for more. We are not going to be like, 'Hey that bonus buy was great, can we have another?'
But the wild blueberry crop is special and should be protected, she said. "We are the only state in America that does this. We need to survive. We should survive. We will survive." The blueberry experts remain optimistic about the future. When Yarborough called to discuss the challenges facing the industry, he was on the road. He'd just left a consulting gig in Township 7, where he said a forestry company was looking into bringing in wild blueberries in areas that had recently been logged (wild blueberries typically can be found in the woods; clearing the canopy gives them room to take over). They were still interested, despite the issues plaguing growers."I guess somebody has got some faith," he said.
Another positive sign for wild blueberries is in production of organic berries, which have not been subject to such wild price fluctuations and consistently get a far higher price.
"Demand is good and sales are good," Yarborough, said. He estimates that organic growers get $1.60 per pound for their berries.
The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA) has certified 40 farms throughout the state as organic, covering 1,286 acres, just a tiny portion of the state's total of 44,000 acres of wild blueberry fields. Most of the organic growers run small operations; only six have farms bigger than 50 acres.
"We've had some increased interest in certifying, including some of the big guys," MOFGA agricultural services director Dave Colson said in an email. The organic certification process takes three years without chemical inputs. Most of the big growers are not organic, although Yarborough said some are experimenting with converting some fields, and one, Merrill Blueberry Farm in Ellsworth, is the only organic certified processor. "But primarily increased interest in the process without a lot of growth, yet. Most want to see what happens this year."
This season so far? "It's pretty good,"said Nicolas Lindholm, who along with Ruth Fiske runs one of the bigger organic farms, Blue Hill Berry Co. They have 70 acres spread out over about 10 locations on the Blue Hill Peninsula. Lindholm started in the business with five acres, and has been steadily growing his business, successfully. Most of Blue Hill Berry Co. sales are fresh (about 80 percent), but they also ship a frozen product all over the country.
Lindholm said Yarborough's $1.60 per pound is a low figure, more like what a grower would get selling to a processor. On the fresh market, Lindholm is getting $6 a pint. He brought his first fresh wild blueberries to market a week ago, and had no problem selling out. "It's a pretty strong market," he said, but he attributes that to steadily building business - and direct relationships within the marketplace - over the last 20 years.
Not that it's a piece of cake.
"The industry as a whole is under great pressure, particularly facing extreme pressure from Canadian berries that I am certainly not immune to," he said.
Expanding the market for organic berries is key, Colson said, before other growers make that conversion to organic, because otherwise the organic side of the crop is likely to face the same kind of price drop that the big growers have seen.
The day before the competition at Fork Food Lab, David Yarborough took the group to Fields' Field organic wild blueberry farm in Dresden for an up-close look at the barrens. He said a lot of the chefs and food service representatives seemed more oriented toward fresh product, which in almost all cases are cultivated blueberries grown on high bushes. The leap to considering a frozen, and much smaller, berry is a big one. "I don't think universally they were all sold on it," Yarborough said. "But a lot of them did see the health attributes."
Sara Lawson, an operations and commercialization chef with the Applebee's culinary innovation team based in Los Angeles, said witnessing the way the blueberries grow wild - with a little help from farmers in terms of water, pollination and nutrients - reminded her of "almost like a fairy kind of magic."
"I found it really Zen," she said. "Peaceful and beautiful."
Her work is focused on helping cooks at nearly 2,000 Applebee's restaurants manage their time strategically. Translation, she's not a buyer. But as she sliced up a plump lobster tail for her dish in the competition, she said she could see how frozen wild blueberries could work for say, a bar drink.
As the event at Fork Food Lab was winding down, McBrady deemed it a success. "Just making that relationship and starting that conversation is a success."
"Beyond that, if one or two of them added it to their account? That would be amazing."
She said the Wild Blueberry Association of North America will definitely repeat the event next year, capitalizing on the momentum they'd created this July.
"We can't be one and done," she said. "That would be silly. If we create a buzz within the industry and we see this popping up on menus, we've just got to keep moving in that direction."

Full text: PHIPPSBURG -- In a quiet tidal cove a few miles from Popham Beach, a team of biologists and fishermen are working to improve water quality and habitat by helping a popular delicacy gain a literal foothold in the muddy bottom.
The late-July sun was baking the air and mudflats as a team of workers dropped what looked like miniature, concrete castles into the receding waters of "The Basin" area of the New Meadows River. Although nearly impossible to see with the naked eye, untold thousands of oyster larvae were tucked into the nooks and crannies of the concrete contraptions, waiting for transplant into their new tidal home.
Oyster farming is booming in the state as restaurants from Boothbay to Los Angeles put shellfish grown in the cold, clean waters of coastal Maine on the menu. But this experimental 400-square-foot plot in The Basin isn't aimed at the commercial market, at least not directly. Instead, The Nature Conservancy and its partners are exploring ways to help restore or build up oyster populations growing on the bottom - rather than in floating cages or bags used by oyster aquaculturalists - in hopes of encouraging more natural spawning in the future.
"This is different in that it is meant to be more permanent on the bottom," said Jeremy Bell, aquatic habitat restoration manager with the Maine chapter of The Nature Conservancy, pointing to the heavy concrete "tiles" slated for The Basin floor. "And hopefully, as we learn the technique, you will get oyster populations growing and you'll get the habitat protection that comes with that reef."
The Nature Conservancy worked with the Phippsburg Shellfish Commission, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR) to line up the project. Located just offshore from a 10,000-acre Conservancy property known as the Basin Preserve, the plot is situated in a sheltered cove that has long drawn both commercial and recreational shellfish harvesters looking for oysters, clams and other edibles.
Eagles, osprey and gulls flew above on a recent afternoon as boaters - in small aluminum boats and high-priced cruisers - drifted through the cove roughly halfway down the peninsula best known for Popham Beach State Park. On the shoreline, about a half-dozen people worked to prepare the concrete "tiles" of oyster larvae while divers scouted out the best placement spots in the calm waters.
Dean Doyle, a fisherman who serves on the Phippsburg Shellfish Commission, said you can still find nice, native American oysters in parts of The Basin along with the non-native European oyster commonly found in Maine. But much of the basin's clams were lost to worm diggers a few years ago, a long-running competition that periodically erupts into tense waterfront exchanges and municipal meetings among those midcoast Mainers who work the mudflats.
Doyle said the Phippsburg Shellfish Commission supported The Nature Conservancy's proposal.
"I think it's a good idea," Doyle, who also volunteers with DMR's water-quality monitoring program. "This is the perfect area to put them. We used to have a lot here . . . Hopefully, it will work, and these will spawn and settle in the area. It can't hurt to try."
Oysters have long been a dietary staple of Maine residents, perhaps best illustrated by the massive shell middens left behind by Native American communities in places such as Damariscotta. And while oysters have always been popular elsewhere among some segments of the population, the bivalves are undergoing a renaissance in restaurants across the country, whether served raw on the half-shell or in some other fashion.
Maine's oyster aquaculture industry is capitalizing on their growing popularity.
Maine DMR reported that oyster farmers hauled in a record $5 million worth of oysters -- or roughly 2.1 million pounds -- in 2016. That is a fraction of the value of Maine's roughly $500 million lobster industry but represents a growing segment of a fishing industry that many fishermen and observers say has become too dependent on the official state crustacean. Oyster landings in Maine have increased 254 percent, and the harvest's value has grown about 300 percent since 2011, according to state records.
And while the Damariscotta River and other parts of the midcoast have long been known for their quality oysters, new oyster aquaculture leases are going out from southern Maine to Down East.
Bell said The Nature Conservancy doesn't ever plan to commercially harvest the oysters that he hopes will soon be populating that corner of The Basin, even though they are using the genetic strain of American oyster commonly used in aquaculture. If the population grew large enough years down the line, Bell said he would be comfortable with locals harvesting some of the oysters on a sustainable basis.
But the real goal is a self-sustaining oyster population that can help improve the ecological health of The Basin and, perhaps, serve as a model for other areas around Maine.
Because oysters are filter-feeders, they are often regarded as a natural ally in the fight to improve water quality as they suck up microorganisms, sediments, nitrogen and nutrients from the water. Those activities help reduce sedimentation in the water column and encourage growth of other aquatic plants, such as eel grass. In turn, these provide food and shelter to other aquatic organisms, thereby helping with ecological diversity.
At The Basin, the team is deploying the roughly 2-foot-square tiles that look like something you might find in a tropical fish aquarium. Before arriving in Phippsburg, the tiles had been in a large tank filled with 500,000 oyster larvae. The idea is the concrete-and-rebar structures -- in addition to providing a platform for baby oysters -- will act like a coral reef, helping to rebuild the complex bottom habitat that provides shelter to smaller fish and other organisms that, in turn, feed larger predators. But Bell acknowledges that is just an idea.
"They tested very well down in Virginia in the Chesapeake Bay," Bell said. "We don't know how they are going to work in Maine."
The team also plans to test other methods of oyster cultivation in the hopes that one, or several, will prove successful at establishing a larger, self-sustaining oyster population and, in the process, improving water quality and habitat.
The larvae-laden tiles weren't even in the waters, however, before the group came face-to-tiny face with one of the major challenges facing bottom-dwelling oysters, clams and other shellfish in southern Maine.
Almost on cue, small green crabs not much larger than a silver dollar began emerging from seemingly nowhere (but actually from the mud or waters) and side-stepping their ways toward the larvae tiles and piles of oyster shells. The invasive green crab has become a menace in recent years to clam and mollusk harvesters who are scrambling to find ways to stop, or at least slow, their spread because of their capacity to kill shellfish larvae.
Amanda Moeser, an oyster farmer who also leads The Nature Conservancy's oyster conservation programs in Maine and New Hampshire, and others devised a plan to enclose the tiles in plastic cages with mesh small enough to keep many green crabs at bay. Those caged tiles were later placed in waters in The Basin deep enough for them to stay full submerged and avoid entanglements with passing boats even at low tide.
Bell said the project will have to weather the winter ice-scraping and other challenges, but he was optimistic about the tiny oyster plot.
"We could potentially do this in other places," Bell said. "Hopefully, other groups or towns might get interested and try it."

IMAGES OF MODERN AMERICA
By Tom Major

Folks in Maine sure do like their beer. Even Benjamin Franklin allegedly praised the beverage: "Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy." And Maine's beer boom now has more than 90 breweries, employing 1,600 people, selling $150 million worth of beer last year.
Portland author Tom Major's new book, "Brewing In Maine," tells of Maine's craft-beer industry since Geary's opened the state's first microbrewery back in 1986. Although overpriced for such a slim softcover book, the story is a lively explanation for craft beer popularity.
With smart narrative supported by nearly 200 color photographs, Major describes the challenges, benefits and fun of creating Maine's growing number of breweries, from well-known names like Geary's, Gritty McDuff, Shipyard and Allagash, to small, obscure micro-breweries like Monhegan Brewing and Belfast Bay Brewing.
Major reveals no beer-brewing secrets, but he does offer fascinating anecdotes about how and why people get involved in the brewing business -- producing lagers, ales and stouts, some in oak barrels, some in stainless steel vats, in barns, farmhouses and large industrial operations.
He tells how some brewers like to experiment with ingredients like different hops, barley, wheat and yeast, as well as additions like agave, oysters, habanero peppers, even onion. Marketing is catchy, too, with names like Bug Lager, Dead Man's Cove IPA, Monkey Fist IPA and Pumpkinhead.
Learn about pub crawls, beer bus tours, the Portland mayor who brought prohibition to Maine in 1851, and about the Franciscan friar making Whoopee Pie Stout at the Friar's Brewhouse in Bucksport.
For those people who need a healthy justification for drinking beer, consider a pundit's reasoning: "Beer is made from hops. Hops are plants. Therefore, beer is a salad."

DESTINY'S PAWN: A PEYTON COTE NOVEL
By D.A. Keeley
Midnight Ink, 2016
346 pages, $15.99
ISBN 978-0-7387-4225-0

Some people really like art. A few like art so much they'll steal it, even kill for it. And Border Patrol Agent Peyton Cote is up to her gunbelt in stolen art, greedy art thieves and ruthless killers who will do anything to get their hands on a priceless painting.
"Destiny's Pawn" is Maine author D.A. Keeley's third mystery featuring Peyton Cote, who patrols the remote northern Aroostook County border between the U.S. and Canada. Keeley has also written an excellent five-volume PGA Tour mystery series under the name John Corrigan. And he's not lost his edge, especially with this latest superbly crafted, taut mystery.
On a winter patrol, Peyton encounters a cold, wet 13-year-old Ukrainian boy coming out of the woods, asking for political asylum. Aleksei Vann tells a fantastic story of solo immigration, fleeing war-torn Ukraine, but his story just doesn't add up. He and his American aunt are both evasive and uncooperative. When the boy's Ukrainian father suddenly shows up on a two-week visa, Peyton senses something is wrong.
Aleksei's teenage American cousin, Michael, is hiding two secrets: one might get him in trouble with the law, the other might get him killed. One secret is directly connected to Aleksei, but the Ukrainian boy doesn't know. Peyton suspects Aleksei is an unwitting pawn in his father's dangerous game which eventually leads back 25 years to an unsolved Boston art heist (think the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum art robbery in 1990).
Add an unwashed, armed scumbag who baits Peyton, a dangerous auto mechanic, a Russian hitman, the double-crossing daughter of a dying Russian mob boss and a trigger-happy cop, and Keeley has yet another fast-paced, suspenseful and wholly believable mystery hit.
Bill Bushnell lives and writes in Harpswell.

Green crabs expected to hog beaches

Full text: The second mild winter in a row means that Maine tidal flats will likely be overrun by large, ravenous invasive green crabs this summer.
That's bad news for the state's already weakened soft-shell clam industry. One green crab can consume 40 half-inch clams a day and will dig 6 inches to find clams to eat. In 2016, clam landings fell 21 percent, from 9.3 million to 7.3 million pounds, the lowest reported since 1991, according to the state Department of Marine Resources.
Some of the landings decline was undoubtedly a result of an unusual bloom of toxic algae that forced a monthlong shellfishing ban along about a third of Maine's coastline last fall, but researcher Sara Randall of the Downeast Institute in Beals notes that a review of landings in towns with traditionally high claim landings south of the Deer Isle-Stonington closure line found 19 out of 24 towns, or 79 percent, had harvested fewer clams.
For example, from 2015 to 2016, landings fell in Harpswell by 35 percent, Yarmouth by 87 percent and Scarborough by 21 percent. In Freeport, a town on the front line of the effort to combat the green crab invasion, landings decreased by 17 percent, despite efforts by municipal officials, clammers and researchers like Randall, among others, to use protective measures like nets and other tools to ward off the green crabs.
The mild winter may only make matters worse. Clammers had hoped for a cold winter, so the deep freeze and ice would kill off a lot of the crabs, allowing the clam seed still found in high numbers in Maine waters a chance to settle in the tidal flats and grow, forming those telltale tiny holes that tell clammers that a harvest awaits them under the mud.
But this winter, Freeport clammer Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association, saw green crabs active throughout the winter, with some even bearing eggs or in soft shells, which is a sign of recent molting. Neither of these usually happens in the cold of winter, which means there will be more crabs on the flats this year looking for dinner, and that many of those will be larger than in years past and thus able to eat more.
As clam harvests become more unpredictable, Coffin said the once thriving clamming culture is fading, and the infrastructure that brought clams to market slowly disappearing. Buyers are leaving the industry and restaurants are writing the summer favorite off their menus, unsure if they will be available on any given day.
"When I first started clamming in 1990, there were three wholesalers here in Freeport," Coffin said. "It is down to one now. He's getting up there in age, so we don't know how long that's going to last. There aren't as many of us clammers here either, with only 1,200 or so left of us in the state, and we're getting old, too, clamming less."
Clammers this year may yet see a good harvest. As the number of clammers decline, those who remain can harvest a bigger share of the smaller harvest. In 2017, they will be harvesting clams that made it from seed to juvenile status because of a cold winter in 2013-14 that killed off many green crabs. As a result, the clams were able to grow big enough, with thick enough shells, to survive predation and fill clammers' bags.
The clammers who remain hope to make a living off that population until the next deep freeze comes along.
But unlike in 2015, when scarcity drove prices up over $2 a pound for the first time, the value of Maine soft-shell clams fell 31.5 percent in 2016. In 2016, soft-shell clams sold for an average of $2.13 a pound, compared to $2.46 a pound in 2015. But that's still more than clammers dreamed of just 10 years ago, when clams sold for an average of $1.43 a pound, and more than enough to keep some clammers coming back for more.
And holding their breath for another cold winter.
The scientist who is leading efforts to find a way to save the iconic industry believes there must be a better way.
"Hope is not a sustainable long-term management plan," said Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at University of Maine at Machias. "I believe the answer lies in aquaculture."
While clammers like Coffin embrace Beal's scientific findings, others denounce the suggestion that they turn to farming clams in small plots of carefully protected flats, possibly leased from the landowners who control access to the upper tidal flats, to keep the industry alive. The old ways still work for them, they say. They question his science and his motives, often in raised voices at local shellfish commission meetings.
But Coffin has seen the empty netted boxes that Beal has built on Freeport flats once thought dead yield thousands of clams in the protected silt come fall. High tide brings the floating clam larvae to the flats. The microscopic seed can pass through the netting-- which is just large enough to let the clams pass through but small enough to keep the crabs out -- to settle in the box. The flats around the box, left unprotected, are empty of clams come fall.
There have been some kinks. Beal has had to put bottoms on the boxes to prevent milky ribbon worms from coming up through the mud from below to eat the baby clams. Not every spot has been as productive as others, although the silt inside the boxes has always yielded far more clams than outside. And the boxes are still too small to yield a commercially profitable crop, although he plans to test larger boxes this summer.
But the evidence was more than enough to persuade Coffin that this is the future of his industry. The ocean temperature is warming, faster in the Gulf of Maine than almost anywhere else in the world, and deep-freeze winters are likely to become rarer in the future, he said. But it will be a difficult change for an industry that has remained essentially unchanged for generations, Coffin said.
Many shellfish commissions that control licensing on the flats are made up of clammers who still cling to the old ways, he said. The riparian landowners who control access to the upper tidal area where would-be farmers could set up protective boxes like the ones Beal uses for research purposes want to keep their ocean views free of farming plots, and the farmers who would tend them.
"The working waterfront is disappearing," Coffin said. "If we can't adapt to what's coming, what's already happened, clamming in Maine will disappear. It may be that a clam digger doesn't have a future, but a clam farmer might. But we can't do it alone. People look out at the ocean and see the blue and the sunsets and think it's beautiful, but they don't see the devastation. They may not see it, but I can. It's decision time."

Full text: I've been doing this for a long time now and there are certain bands and individuals that I really want to talk with before the end. One such group is Blue Oyster Cult, whose hits, such as "(Don't Fear) The Reaper," "In Thee," "Godzilla," "Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll," and "Burnin' for You," have become classics in every sense of the word. I caught their headlining act up at the Bangor Auditorium many years ago and have been a fan ever since.
So when I learned that they were coming to the Waterville Opera House on the May 25 I just had to try and get a conversation with a member. Well, much to my surprise and pleasure, Eric Bloom -- one of the two remaining founders (the other being Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser) -- was willing to chat for a few minutes early one afternoon.
Q: It's great to be chatting with you at long last. I vividly remember a show in Bangor where Godzilla's head rose up behind the drum kit and lazered a huge mirror ball at the other end of the Civic Center.
Bloom: That must have been a long time ago.
Q: Oh, it was. I wish I could remember the year. Now, I understand from your management that your 2001 album, "Curse of the Hidden Mirror," was your last studio album. Are you working on something new, hopefully?
Bloom: We have a record deal about to be signed. Probably within a month we'll know more, but chances are we'll be making something new, and probably have it out before summer of next year.
Q: That's great news. Did you ever think, back when you first started in the early '70s, that you'd still be going strong now?
Bloom: Well, that's an often-asked question that, of course, is tough to answer because at my age then -- who knew? There are a lot of people that were with us in our sort of gang of friends that are not even here so you never know what's going to happen. I mean, there's been many times where we thought BOC would not even exist let alone would I still be there, so it's hard to say. We just take it as it comes, you know? Of course we had our 10 and 12 years where everything was hot and fast -- I mean, we made an album a year -- and then the mid-80s came and gravity set in. Then there was a resurgence in the '90s and now, in this era, we actually are doing better now than we ever did in our history. So it's strange days.
Q: It's wild because your music pops up all over the place, like the TV series "Supernatural."
Bloom: It was on "Orange Is the New Black" -- at the end of Season Two they played "The Reaper" in the final minutes.
Q: And then you have writers like Stephen King ...
Bloom: Right, he used it in "The Stand." And of course the (Saturday Night Live) "Cowbell" sketch and many different things where BOC becomes a reference.
Q: And recently King had a "Reaper" reference in his Bill Hodges' trilogy, particulary in "End Of Watch."
Bloom: And the J.K. Rowling book, "Career of Evil," which came out last year.
Q: That's so cool. Now with the new album coming out soon, do the years that you have in this group give you a different perspective as far as the songwriting goes?
Bloom: Of course everything changes; (there are) different influences as the music scene changes. Of course you always kind of write what you like and what you know, but I don't think BOC will be doing any hip-hop anytime soon.
Q: Thank God. One thing I've noticed over the years is that the songs you guys write all have that signature hook or riff that captures the listener's attention almost immediately. Also, the musical growth of BOC is right in the forefront. Is that growth a natural progression or is it something you've worked on over time?
Bloom: That's more of an observer kind of thing than anything I could put my finger on. You know, every record is written a different way -- sometimes all in one room, sometimes people bring songs in. Every year is something different. We're just glad to still be here and still making some music.
Q: So what can folks expect from this Waterville Opera House show?
Bloom: Oh, you know, the obvious suspects plus a sprinkling of our catalogue, and a good live show.
Q: Will you be playing any of that new material there that night?
Bloom: No, we haven't even started.
Q: Is there any special staging or light show?
Bloom: No, we haven't done that in 40 years. You've got to remember, we do these one-nighters and we can't carry stuff. I mean, the day after Maine we might be playing L.A., so we have to carry what we can, we just can't literally carry a production.
Q: Well, now that I think about it, that does make sense and it's the music that matters anyhow. Is there anything you'd like to pass on to the folks reading this article?
Bloom: No, we just enjoy playing live still. That's our meat-and-potatoes. And we'll be glad to play in that area again.
Q: Is there anything that we haven't discussed that you think we should?
Bloom: We'll be playing all over the country and all over Europe between now and the end of the year, a lot of festivals. We have a Facebook page and a lot of ways that people can follow us.

Full text: argaret Morris' mother, like a million mothers before her, used to come home with those Clinique giveaways, tester-sized packages of makeup and skin-smoothing agents in pale green tubes. The name sounded like they were fresh off the Concorde from Paris, although in reality, Clinique products were created and made by an American company, Estée Lauder. These cleverly marketed potions were full of promises for blooming complexions, and as a teenager in Auburn, Morris did her fair share of browsing beauty products like them at the mall.
These days though, Morris buys Maine honey by the five-gallon jug, orders beeswax and shea butter online and mixes up recipes for skin care products in her own kitchen in Brunswick. She sells her line, Five Islands Body Co, at farmers markets, local boutiques, health food stores and online using Shopify's services. Morris is one of a growing number of Mainers who have gone into the skin care business in recent years, making use of Maine ingredients and capitalizing on a local aesthetic that is far more Ivory Girl than Parisian sophisticate. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone in this crowd making blue eye shadow; the Maine-made product is more typically about enhancing an already natural look with everything from rosa rugosa to seaweed.
"There's this whole aura surrounding the Maine-made beauty products," said Tammy Knight, who runs the state's Maine Made program, a marketing effort run through the Department of Economic and Community Development, and who ushered Morris into its fold of about 2,100 "makers" a few months ago. "There's this handcrafted element, that somebody is actually touching it and doing the mixing and the testing. It evokes the state. It is clean and it is pure."
Newcomers like Morris are part of today's local movement, but they're following in some big, even giant, footsteps. Maine is where Tom and Kate Chappell experimented with Tom's of Maine toothpaste and such in the 1970s and where Roxanne Quimby and Burt Shavitz started the mega-successful, natural skincare company Burt's Bees in the 1980s. Then there is Deb Soule's Avena Botanicals, whose organic herbal remedies include consumables like elixirs and teas but also salves and skin creams such as Fairy Flower Creme, a stalwart in many beauty regimes for 28 years. Going back even further? In 1934, beauty magnate Elizabeth Arden opened the Maine Chance Spa in Mount Vernon;, which was operational until 1970.
Those companies do have an influence in today's new product makers.
"Obviously, Burt's Bees was a magical formula," said Gabrielle "Gabs" Melchionda of Mad Gabs, a Yarmouth-based maker of natural and organic lip, body and foot balms. "She (Quimby) paved the way for people like me." (In the department of small world Maine, Melchionda used to be married to one of the Chappell's sons.) Claire Weinberg of Dulse & Rugosa, a botanicals company that got its start in 2012 on Gotts Island off Mount Desert Island, said Maine's skin and personal care magnates served as an inspiration for the "big idea" that brought Dulse & Rugosa into existence. So did legendary Maine homesteaders Helen and Scott Nearing. Weinberg and her daughter (and business partner's) desire to live and work on Gotts Island mirrored the Nearing's commitment to place, she said. But, she said, inspiration only goes so far in practical terms.
"I knew there were great companies out there, but I was also clueless about business," Weinberg said, laughing. "We have made a lot of mistakes."
For Morris, the inspiration to open a business was born of frustration with one of those famed Maine companies about six years ago. She'd been using a body butter product made by Burt's Bees, which is now owned by the Clorox Company and run out of Durham, North Carolina, and liked it, but when she went to buy more of it, something seemed different. "The formula seemed to have changed drastically," she said. The fragrance was "funky." She shopped around. "I just couldn't find something that didn't have perfume or synthetic ingredients."
Morris already had a do-it-yourself impulse, and she went looking for recipes. In 2011, while her infant daughter (now 6) was napping, Morris would be melting ingredients, sliding them into the fridge to firm them up and testing them on herself. Soon Morris was making not just body butter she could use on her baby, but lip balms and then lotions and hand creams, made with essential oils instead of perfumes. She'd pass on extra to friends and family. Positive feedback encouraged her to start selling her line in 2015. Now, with her Maine Made certification, she's poised for growth.
That's not always an obvious path, and it rarely leads to the kind of payouts Quimby or the Chappells got when they sold their companies to conglomerates (Quimby reportedly more than $300 million, Chappell, about $100 million). Melchionda said she operated "on a shoestring" for 25 years and only moved past being a cottage industry about three years ago, when her kids were a little older (they're 13 and 17).
"I never stopped working, but I never pushed the way I would have had I not had kids," she said.
Initially, her lip balm making was an offshoot of a "hippie" lifestyle, she said, almost a hobby for a good four years. Then in 1997, QVC, the television shopping channel, came to Maine looking for companies to promote. Mad Gabs was one of them. Still, many of her sales involved shoe leather and time in the car, driving to natural food stores all over Maine.
For the last two years she and her staff have been delivering to Hannafords all over the region, 87 in all. They just made the grade to get into the warehouse.
"You have to earn your chops," Melchionda said.
As a longtime Maine maker, she says she tries to be helpful to newcomers in the beauty business. Gaining entry to the business has never been easier -- throwing up a website and finding someone to print labels is a snap. Sustaining a business is a lot harder.
"I have seen so many people come and go in the last 10 years," she said. "Honestly, it takes a long time to make it happen."
Though she's always worked with organic and natural ingredients, her packaging is far less homespun than say, the classic Burt's Bees look. "They have stayed true to the yellow and tan thing," Melchionda said. "Kind of gender neutral. I can't be that calm with my packaging."
Like say, her Huckleberry Bear Smooch Lip Balm. It's made with organic extra-virgin olive oil, organic beeswax, Vitamin E and organic flavor. But nothing about it screams homespun or handmade or "farm" or for that matter, "Maine." She ships her products in plant-based "peanuts" and recycled newspapers.
She's not tapping into that crafty, Maine aesthetic like many of the others, but that may be a product of practicality.
"It is hard to make money selling three of this and five of that," she said. "Mass-produced gets a bad rap, but that is when you make money." She places Mad Gabs in an in-between zone she dubs "affordable organics."
The company has dabbled in shimmers and glosses, but that's as close as she's gotten to makeup. "Our line was always to encourage natural beauty and health in women and girls," Melchionda said. "I have no idea how you make mascara. I am not interested in that."
Maine Revenue Services doesn't track beauty-related businesses, so it's difficult to quantify exactly how many new makers are producing Maine-made beauty and skincare products. But the list includes an oyster farmer in Scarborough and a mother in Waldoboro, whose success with an item inspired by the 2016 presidential election helped fund a bricks and mortar store.
What they have in common, besides Maine and typically gender (women dominate this business) is that their entrepreneurship stemmed, as Morris' did, from a need to address a very specific personal need, whether for themselves or a family member. And as that need was met, a financial imperative kicked in; the way they helped themselves could also be a way to help cement a future in Maine.
For Claire Weinberg, it was about hair. Specifically, dandruff. She is not shy about admitting she had it. Her itchy scalp started in high school and hardly ever let up, despite medicated shampoos and a stash of shampoos and conditioners that quite clearly implicated her as a heavy consumer, the kind who would wash her hair every day and go through seven (plastic) bottles a month. "I was a hair product junkie," Weinberg said.
She was teaching and so was her daughter Carly, a recent College of the Atlantic graduate. Both of them were eager to spend more time on Gotts Island near Bass Harbor, where they were the only year-round residents. They tried farming, like the Nearings, but even in the summer there weren't enough other people around to sustain a living. Then one day Claire came home and found Carly cooking up seaweed in the kitchen; she was working on a shampoo that might help her mother get off the product treadmill.
That was 2012. Their company, Dulse & Rugosa, is best known for its shampoo bars (hard, round and cured for a month). The constants in their various products, which include a "sunburn survival" kit, tend to be rosa rugosa and seaweeds, including sugar kelp and oarweed, harvested from Gotts Island by Carly, who is a licensed harvester. and the Weinbergs are at what feels like a turning point (at presstime, Claire Weinberg had her fingers crossed that "Marie Claire" would be mentioning, or even, endorsing, one of Dulse & Rugosa's products in its June issue). To sell, she roves farmers markets in Maine and as far south as Boston, and they continue to expand their product line. But she hasn't quit her part-time teaching job yet and questions, can they make a go of it full time?
"I'm wondering, is doing these other things actually holding me back?" Weinberg said.
Amanda Nelson of Long Winter Soap Company has been in the skincare business for a decade now - her inspiration was her oldest daughter's cradle cap, which needed the gentlest of soaps - cooking up soap and lip balms and skin cream at her home in Waldoboro, in "small batches from sustainably-obtained ingredients," and selling them first on Etsy and then on Shopify.
"With this economy, you have to kind of make your own job," Nelson said. "Because there are no jobs here."
But this month she made a big move, into her first brick-and-mortar store in downtown Waldoboro. The morning after the debate where Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a "nasty woman," Nelson and her husband, Lucas McNelly, dreamed up a new lip balm flavor, "Nasty Woman." (It's flavored with coffee and walnut, in case you wondered.) The Maine Democrats put in an order immediately and the lip balm went viral. Nelson and McNelly sold about 18,000 of them, Nelson said, and helped fund the new store. "It made it so we didn't have to borrow anything."
Nelson's soaps are seriously striking, with artful and unexpected designs. She packages them in muslin bags and tests "on friends, not animals" She uses essential oils. "I stay away from the ones that aren't sustainably harvested," Nelson said. That includes sandlewood ("crazy over-harvested.") But she does use many ingredients that come from far away, including palm oil, which is criticized by many environmental groups because rainforests and other critical habitats are often cleared to produce it; she says hers is certified as sustainably harvested.
Herein lies an interesting issue with many Maine-made beauty products. Just because they're handcrafted in Maine doesn't mean they're made with ingredients sourced from Maine. For example, Nelson uses Dead Sea salts, not Maine salt.
"The Maine sea salt is so expensive right now. It (her product) would have to be at a crazy price point."
Weinberg doesn't use Maine sea salt either, and for the same reason, but something like Dulse & Rugosa's "Sinus Relief" smelling salts includes calendula and bachelor button flower petals grown on Gott's Island. That sourcing is key to her marketing, as is her effort to get to zero waste with packaging (mostly paper and glass, except for the lip balms).
"The great thing about skin care is, everybody has skin," Weinberg said. "And hey, instead of buying something that has maybe come from China and you don't know where the ingredients came from, you can buy it from a Maine farm."
About 80 percent of the ingredients in Deb Soule's Avena Botanicals are grown in Maine on Avena's organic and biodynamic farm. Avena grows its herbs outdoors on about 3 acres, Soule said, and uses a greenhouse to start about 5,000 seedlings.
The ingredients she does have to source from away, including olive, coconut and almond oils, are all organic. It has gotten easier to find those organic ingredients in the last 13 or so years, she said. That sourcing, either from Maine or through organic and ethical producers, is important to Soule.
"The Maine Made label is a wonderful label," Soule said. "But it can be a little confusing to people if they are products that are being made in Maine, but they are getting many of the ingredients from elsewhere."
Her own growth has been slow and steady. If she wants to make, say, a face cream with rose petals as a key ingredient, she has to cultivate the roses. Her hedgerow of rosa rugosa, the only biodynamically grown rugosa in the country, she said, last year yielded 40 pounds of rose petals. That's petals, those nearly weightless things, not hips or flowers.
"I don't have a business or a marketing department," Soule said. "I am an herbalist and an herb farmer."
Another farmer with a sideline in the skincare business is Abigail Carroll, whose oyster farm in Scarborough, Nonesuch, is shared with her line of beauty products, Nonesuch Skin Care. The oyster farm came first and cultivating oysters in chilly waters motivated her experiments with Maine ingredients, including seaweed. She'd been a day trader in Paris, living a, well, Parisian life, and suddenly she said, she'd acquired "these lobsterman hands."
"Some days I couldn't wash my hair because my hands were so cracked and bleeding," she said. "I was really worried about the damage I was getting."
But as rough as the elements were on her skin, some of them seemed to hold promise of a fix. "If you just pick up seaweed and rub it on your hands you will see a difference," she said. "It will put this nice little film of a protector on your hands."
Nonesuch Skin Care has had to be sidelined sporadically during the last few years - the oyster farm is the priority - but she's made marketing inroads in unexpected ways. When she brought oysters to an event in New York hosted by author and oyster expert Rowan Jacobson, she brought samples of her hand salve. Connections have led to high-end shops, like the New York Yacht Club's store in Newport, Rhode Island, or Clutch, a boutique in Nantucket.
"I'm not trying to do what Tom's of Maine or Burt's Bees does," Carroll said. "We are a little more upscale."
Pricewise, Nonesuch products tend to be comparable to say, Kiehl's instead of Burt's Bees or Five Islands. For example, that Maine-harvested sea salt that makers like Morris, Nelson and the Weinbergs shy away from because of its cost? Carroll uses it exclusively in her body scrub ($45).
"We want to make beautiful products, whether they be oysters or skincare products, that have a little smattering of luxury but are really all about the nature, that tell a bigger story about the Maine coast."
Part of what has kept her pace slow and deliberate is a desire to make good choices, sustainability wise, in packaging. "We want our products to really reflect our values as farmers, because our interests as farmers are really tied to the environment."
She's working on a product now that will incorporate oyster shells, cooking ingredients in her kitchen and testing on friends ("Maine divas" she jokes). Unlike some of the other do-it-yourself skincare makers, she's had help from consultants with deep expertise to help her iron out the kinks. One is Kirsten Marsh, a friend from graduate school who spent much of her career working in the cosmetics business in Paris.
"She worked in New York and Paris and London," Carroll said. "She worked for everybody. She started at Clinique."
Clinique again; in the beauty world, the same names tend to resurface. But these Maine entrepreneurs are hoping to make an impact with a whole new set of names.

Full text: Mary Burr points at the spinach sprouting in the high tunnel at the farm she owns with her husband, Bob Burr, on Corson Road in Mercer on Thursday afternoon.
"We'll harvest this on Saturday morning to serve at dinner," she said.
The in-season vegetables will be served at the couple's farm-to-table restaurant, 122 Corson, which sits only about 400 feet from the high tunnels.
The restaurant, which first opened its doors last June, is starting its second season Saturday. The hyperlocal dining experience is the natural evolution of the couple's commitment to good food and local products, Mary said.
"We just wanted to have a place that we would be happy to go to," she said. "We're firm believers of you are what you eat."
The restaurant is part of a growing local food movement in the Skowhegan area, which Kristina Cannon would consider a "local agricultural food hub."
Cannon is the executive director of Main Street Skowhegan, a nonprofit started in 2005 to revitalize the area.
Local agriculture is "certainly one of the most important assets that we have currently," she said. The movement began with the opening of the Somerset Grist Mill, co-owned by Amber Lambke, and gained momentum with the Pickup Community Supported Agriculture food-shares program and a year-round farmers market.
"People from around the state are starting to notice that we have this great local food economy," Cannon said.
The Burrs first got into the business of farming at the local farmers market, but they were growing their own food well before they decided to take it to market.
Mary, 63, grew up in Brisbane, Australia, where her family raised horses and cattle. She met Bob, 66, who is from Eastport, after he won a scholarship to study in the country for a year. When they married in 1973 and Mary moved to Maine, they decided to grow their own food with a large garden.
"That became our way of eating, that traditional Maine style of making our own food," Mary said.
While Bob worked as the president and CEO of Pride Manufacturing, Mary raised a flock of Dorset sheep and grew hay commercially for 35 years.
When he retired, the couple bought a high tunnel in which to grow vegetables using the method designed by Eliot Coleman, who has written books on organic farming and growing vegetables year-round.
They found that they produced more than they could eat, Mary said, so they started Blue Ribbon Farm and joined the Skowhegan Farmers Market. Later, they put up a second high tunnel and added a few acres outside.
"We've never thought of the farm as hard work," she said. "Growing our own food has always been a pleasure."
When the Somerset Grist Mill was started, they began thinking about what demand wasn't being met. A number of people were making bread, so the Burrs went to Italy and learned how to make pasta, which began their Pasta Fresca business.
Bob's understanding of business and finance is what has kept the farm businesses from facing the challenges so many others in agriculture face, Mary said. Any market they chose to enter, Bob would study for at least 12 months, she said.
After taking on a number of commercial ventures, the couple is focusing on "relaxing" with 122 Corson.
"We've already made our living, so we don't have the strain on us that other people have," Mary said.
The restaurant broke even in its first year, making a small profit, which is uncommon in the industry, Mary said.
Meanwhile, the Burrs have decided "to start peeling some of the layers back a bit." The pasta machines are up for sale, and the Burrs are attending fewer farmers markets as they try to simplify for the future.
The restaurant is the first building on their property that sits near the top of a hill on Corson Road, about two miles from U.S. Route 2.
Most people find out about 122 Corson by word of mouth, Mary said. People from out of state who own camps in the area come for dinner, as well as locals who are looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion.
The property features beautiful mountain views of muted shades of purple and blue. In the center of the vista is Mount Blue, to the left Sugarloaf and Saddleback mountains, and to the right, on a clear day Mary said, Mount Washington in New Hampshire is visible.
The view also keeps the Burrs going through hard days of farm work. "You've got to look up," Mary said.
Bob has eaten in "thousands" of restaurants around the world while working, Mary said, so he had an idea of what to focus on when starting the business.
"We're both very particular in what we eat and where we eat," she said.
Their focus was simple: healthy food, a welcoming atmosphere, attentive but noninvasive servers and happy staff.
The restaurant is open one to two days each week, seats 20 people and is usually full, Mary said. She encourages everyone to arrive early for their reservation so they can mingle and make friends.
"We wanted to foster the community aspect of it," she said.
The fixed menu, which is prepared by house chef Ed Lamarre, includes an appetizer, salad, entree, dessert, and tea or coffee and ranges from $60 to $65 per person. It changes each week with what's blooming in the garden.
What the Burrs don't grow themselves in their two high tunnels and quarter-acre vegetable plot, they get from local farmers.
The seafood is from Mill Cove Lobster Pound in Boothbay Harbor and Maine Shellfish in Ellsworth; the meat comes from Caldwell Family Farm in Turner; some root vegetables come from Moodytown Gardens; the apples come from Cayford's Apple Orchard; and the cheese Mary offers to people while they're waiting is sourced from Crooked Face Creamery in Norridgewock and Kennebec Creamery in Sidney.
The Burrs hired locals to build the restaurant, as well. Mike Smiley, of New Sharon, built the timber frame, and John Dingley, of Industry, worked as the carpenter.
While the couple never thought they would open a restaurant, the venture has given them an opportunity to provide support to the local agriculture network they met while working the farmers market, Mary said.
"The quality is there and that's what makes the difference for the people who eat here. They can taste the freshness," Mary said. "The freshness and the flavor is so superior."
Sourcing all of their food locally isn't really difficult, she said, because that's what they're focused on. If they were just focused on the profit margin, it might be different.
"We wanted to be able to serve people food that is the way we eat," Mary said.
According to Cannon of Main Street Skowhegan, 122 Corson is also an "important asset" for the region because it provides a unique experience that people are looking for, drawing visitors to the area.
"Visitors are looking for authentic and local experiences, and that's exactly what 122 Corson offers," she said.
It's also something that's important to locals. When the strategic planning committee for Skowhegan surveyed 500 people in the community, they said that the local food movement is what they're most proud of and what they would like to see expand.
"Businesses like 122 Corson ... are all important to the local region and, ultimately, to the Skowhegan brand," Cannon said.

Full text: Maine Cap N' Stem is growing iits business of selling kits to grow mushrooms for home growers and commercial operations from a warehouse in Gardiner.
GARDINER -- At some point in building Maine Cap N' Stem, it became clear the original plan wasn't going to work.
Three partners -- Mark Robinson, Erik Lomen and Christopher Campbell -- had come together to grow organic gourmet mushrooms, but it was just too much.
"Once you get going," Robinson said, "You can't stop. If we don't produce right now, we are screwed in two months."
Growing mushrooms, it turns out, is about a 20-step process that generally can be split into two parts. The first part is developing the growing material and inoculating it with the kind of mushrooms you want to grow. The second part is the fruiting stage when mushrooms start to grow, and all the steps needed to get them to market. Completing both halves of the equation leads to 90-hour workweeks and few breaks.
"We got to the point where we wanted to buy the blocks. We wanted certified organic substrate," he said. "That way, we could be happy and have weekends."
They couldn't find anything they liked, and that's when the light bulb switched on: They could make it themselves and move into an underserved niche and stake their claim there.
They gutted their business plan and built a new one from the ground up as a wholesaler of mushroom blocks to growers.
Maine Cap N' Stem focuses on wood-loving mushrooms -- shiitake, chestnut, oyster and lion's mane -- for which it makes a red oak sawdust-based sterile substrate into which they introduce spawn.
The mixture is sealed into specially made plastic bags and left to incubate in a temperature-controlled environment.
The process is about understanding how mushrooms grow and controlling it so the packs don't fruit before they should.
That decision triggered others, including relocating outside the Portland region where high demand for space generally means high rent.
The 3,000-square-foot facility in Westbrook was suitable when they were growing mushrooms for the retail market, but for a wholesale facility where proximity to customers isn't a priority, it wasn't going to work.
When they looked for other commercial spaces a little more than a year ago, Gardiner popped up on the radar, with a former mill space off Brunswick Avenue.
"This move is probably the smartest business move that we have made," Robinson said, standing in the company's incubation room Friday as workers filled customer orders.
For Gardiner's part, finding Maine Cap N' Stem was a happy accident.
Patrick Wright, executive director of Gardiner Main Street and economic development coordinator for the city of Gardiner, had been looking at a building in downtown Gardiner and mentioned they were looking for warehouse space in central Maine.
"We weren't explicitly seeking them out," Wright said. "They recognized quickly we are a community and area seeking that kind of economic development."
In an era of increasing consolidation in the food sector, Wright said, the local foods movement -- which is one of Gardiner's economic engines -- is a bright spot where entrepreneurs can reclaim a part of food production.
"It takes a sharp entrepreneur to see it and to execute it," he said. "What I also think is really smart -- and I respect them for it -- is they are letting their sales growth lead their investment growth."
Their hands have been on everything they do.
"We do most of our own fabrication," Robinson said. "The equipment that we use is not available on the open market."
That means a lot of trial and error in building things such as the racks where the incubation occurs. Through a happy accident, they found the bags do better if they are spaced about a hand's width apart. The incubating bags put off heat and the space allows the heat to disperse.
"Sometimes you are building something 17 times, but you get what you want," he said.
At first, the partners thought they would build their market in the Northeast, reaching west to New York state and south to New Jersey, Lomen said.
Before long, word spread and Maine Cap N' Stem started fielding orders from as far away as Montana, Colorado and Texas.
Right now, Lomen said, about half their product goes to New England and neighboring states, and half goes elsewhere.
And that, he said, is good for the local economy because it draws in new money.
"You think of the local food movement as farm-to-table being within a 30-mile radius," Wright said.
"The local food movement in Montana is feeding the local food movement in Maine. That speaks not to a fad but a true economic trend," he said.
The company's growth potential is strong.
The West Coast is filled with people, many of Asian descent, for whom mushrooms are a staple in their culinary tradition.
The East Coast is catching up and moving beyond the traditional white mushrooms that supermarkets regularly stock in the produce section.
"Everybody likes them, but they don't know where they come from," Robinson said. "This is where the specialty ones come from."
The innovation and the trial and error haven't stopped.
The building they occupy has space for expansion, and that will accommodate their immediate plan to scale up the operation, adding more product and more workers, and helping farmers to reach their capacity.
They also want to build retail sales for grow-at-home customers.
With the help of grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Maine Technology Institute, they are exploring developing other strains of shiitake mushrooms to see how they interact with their style of substrate.
Some customers prefer larger mushrooms; others prefer smaller.
Lomen said half a billion strains can exist on a single mushroom cap.
"There is not a lot of information on cultivation that is not convoluted," he said.
They are considering retailing blocks for home growers, and they are thinking about other things they can do with their indoor farm.
It could be something like vegetable pack starts, Robinson said.
"We have a partner (Campbell) who always brings up crickets," Lomen said.
"We have no interest in that," Robinson said.
"Well, maybe," Lomen said.
"OK, we have very little interest in that," Robinson said. "I just don't want to step into a room with 700 million crickets in it. It creeps me out."

Full text: The budget that President Donald Trump proposed Thursday would have serious consequences across Maine, disrupting scientific research and social services, and affecting everyone from unemployed residents to those who rely on the sea to earn their living.
If approved by Congress, the 52-page plan would strip federal dollars from programs that provide heating oil and meals to low-income Mainers, legal aid to indigent citizens, and funding for homeless services. It would stop federal funds from flowing to Maine Public's television and radio outlets, the University of Maine's Sea Grant research program and research efforts at the Wells Reserve at Laudholm, which could end up closing.
The budget outline was subjected quickly to withering bipartisan criticism on Capitol Hill.
"I have a hard time seeing how eliminating heating assistance, cutting medical research and ending economic development funding do little more than harm people families and businesses across Maine," said independent Sen. Angus King in a statement. "To me this doesn't seem like a serious attempt to offer a reasonable, cost-cutting budget -- and, sadly, it's hardworking, middle-class folks throughout the state who would bear the brunt of it all."
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said there "a number of serious problems" with the budget and that it will be "subject to significant revision by Congress."
First District Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, declared it "dead on arrival." Second District Rep. Bruce Poliquin, a Republican, praised Trump for increasing funding for veterans and national security but said he had concerns about many of the cuts.
"The Trump budget is really a disaster from our perspective, and nothing more than a down payment on tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else," said Garrett Martin, executive director of the Maine Center for Economic Policy. "For Maine families and communities, this budget is a step back in terms of helping communities thrive and create opportunity."
The president's budget contains some potential benefits for Mainers, including increased funding for veterans' services and opioid treatment and recovery, as well as funding to restart work on a long-stalled federal nuclear waste depository in Nevada, which would create a final resting place for the spent fuel stranded at the former Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset. As well, most of the proposed cuts in Trump's budget are intended to fund a massive expansion of the military budget, which could benefit Maine's defense contractors.
Here are some effects the Trump budget could have in Maine:
The Environmental Protection Agency faces the largest cut in the entire budget -- 31 percent and a staff reduction of 3,200 -- which environmentalists say would devastate environmental protection in Maine.
The cuts include nearly a third to state grant programs that help clean up abandoned industrial sites, and protect air and water quality, and the elimination of grants to help Maine and other states mitigate radon, conduct beach water quality tests and buy cleaner school buses. The cuts also would affect the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, which receives more than 20 percent of its funding from the EPA, most of it to support clean air and clean water programs.
The cuts were foreshadowed in a preliminary budget plan leaked last month. Collns, King and Pingree all condemned a 30 percent cut to the so-called "brownfield" program, which has helped Maine towns clean up old mill and industrial sites so they could be redeveloped. The official budget document doesn't mention the program by name, but it appears to have been among the "more than 50 EPA programs" it promises to eliminate in order "to focus on its highest national priorities."
"We thought there was a slight chance that some of the cuts would be restored, but instead they cut even deeper," said Pete Didisheim, advocacy director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. "This is really a slash-and-burn budget. It's about as bad as we could possibly have imagined."
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency's Sea Grant program would disappear. The program has funded groundbreaking work on how to monitor juvenile lobster populations so researchers can better predict future health of the stock; assisted mussel, scallop and kelp farmers with research and methodological expertise; developed organic certification guidelines for sea vegetable growers; and helped monitor and contain bacteria and other marine pests that plague shellfish growers and harvesters.
Sea Grant researchers created the Fishermen's Forum -- the industry's premier event -- in 1976, and also helped found the Portland Fish Exchange and the university's Lobster Institute, which researches issues of concern to the industry. The Sea Grant funding also helped pay for the removal of dams and restoration of fish habitat in the Penobscot River watershed, and now provides $600,000 a year to improve road crossings and culverts there.
"Communities really care about this, because it's allowing them to prepare better and make their roads better before a storm happens, to help reduce flooding," said Kate Dempsey, state director for the Nature Conservancy's Maine chapter, which is a Sea Grant partner.
The budget also would eliminate coastal and marine management programs, which include the nation's 29 National Estuarine Research Reserves. One of those -- the Wells Reserve at Laudholm -- is in Maine and another, the Great Bay Estuarine Reserve, is just over the border in New Hampshire.
The budget would eliminate funding for the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which provides a wide range of money for Maine cities and towns, and has called for the elimination of "a number of lower priority programs" at the department, including the HOME Investment Partnership Program.
Community Development Block Grants and HOME funding have helped Portland address the needs of homeless people and improve housing and economic opportunities in low-income neighborhoods, said Mary David, the city's housing and community development director.
Last year Portland received $1.7 million in CDBG funds and $800,000 from HOME. Maine's largest city spends about 45 percent of its CDBG budget on social services, including $150,000 for community policing. Programs that have been recommended for funding next year include food pantries, homeless shelters, mental health services, case work, child care subsidies for low-income single parents and a new program that would offer jobs to panhandlers. The city anticipates spending $807,000 on development activities, such as replacing sidewalks, workforce training for people facing barriers to employment, and other infrastructure programs.
Mark Swann, director of the Portland nonprofit Preble Street, which operates a day shelter and soup kitchen, said the elimination of CDBG would make it more difficult for nonprofits that serve the needy to remain open. "Our existence is pretty fragile," he said. "CDBG is one of the only (ways) we're getting support for some of the basic emergency services we provide."
The Low Income Heating Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, provides heating assistance to about 45,000 Mainers, and it would be gone under Trump's budget.
The budget document describes LIHEAP as "a lower-impact program" that is "unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes." The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services program is administered in Maine by the Maine Housing Authority.
The program is particularly important in Maine, which relies heavily on oil for home heating. A family of four with an income under $47,350 is eligible for assistance.
The budget would eliminate the Legal Services Corp., a Nixon-era agency that provides funding for legal aid agencies that help the poor take grievances to court.
In Maine, the agency provides $1.4 million a year to Pine Tree Legal Assistance, a 50-year-old legal aid agency that represents poor Mainers in 4,500 cases a year. "That funding represents over half our budget for general legal services, and that's especially important in rural Maine, because we have fewer funding sources in rural counties," said Pine Tree's executive director, Nan Heald.
A volunteer for Pine Tree, Tom Cox, made national news after exposing the "robo-signing" scandal among sub-prime mortgage lenders. In its early years, Pine Tree brought young legal fellows from out of state, including a young Virginia lawyer named Angus King and attorney Tom Tureen, who would settle the 1980 Indian land claims settlement with the state, transforming the rights of tribal people in the eastern United States.
If Legal Services Corp. were eliminated, Heald said, Pine Tree wouldn't close but would likely have to shutter some of its six offices scattered across the state.
The budget would cut the U.S. Department of Agriculture by 21 percent. John Bott, spokesman for Maine's agriculture commissioner, Walt Whitcomb, said the commissioner was not available to comment on what effect the cuts could have in Maine.
The USDA regularly gives grants to Maine farms and farm-related businesses. The farm conservation group Maine Farmland Trust, which has protected 40,000 acres of Maine farmland, also provides services to farms that are aided by USDA grants. Last fall, the USDA announced to a grant to the trust to help its Farming for Wholesale program, which helps farmers find wholesale markets for their goods. For smaller-scale farmers, finding a place in this bigger marketplace can be one of their biggest challenges.
"We are very concerned about any proposed cuts to the USDA budget which could directly impact the availability of programs and services that many of Maine's farmers rely on for technical assistance and financing support," said Amanda Beal, president of the Belfast-based trust.
Among those programs are those implemented by the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, which gives technical support to farms across Maine in areas as diverse as soil and energy usage. The Maine office of the USDA's Farm Service Agency works on everything from disaster and flood relief to helping dairy farmers with protections on milk pricing.
Trump's budget would cut $9.2 billion, or 13.5 percent, from the Department of Education budget, reducing or eliminating grants for teacher training, after-school programs and aid to low-income and first-generation college students. It would add $1.4 billion for school choice programs, including charter schools, private-school vouchers and other alternatives to public schools.
Maine gets almost $700 million from the Department of Education every year. Most of it is for grants to help students pay for higher education: $409 million for federal direct student loan program, $104 million in Pell grants and $8.3 million in federal work-study grants.
Maine's federal DOE grants for kindergarten-through-grade 12 programs include $58.6 million for special education, $53.6 million for Title I funds for disadvantaged youth, $15.8 million in vocational rehabilitation and $10.7 million for effective instruction.
Nationwide, federal funds pay for 8 percent of elementary and secondary education; the rest is funded by the state. In addition to DOE, federal education funds come from the Department of Health and Human Services' Head Start program and the Department of Agriculture's School Lunch program. Maine gets about $13 million in Head Start funds and more than $45 million for various child nutrition programs.
By contrast, Maine's charter schools could benefit from the increase in federal funding available. So far, three charter schools in Maine have received a total of about $1 million in federal funds, in the form of grants to develop performance-based education plans, or technology grants.
Trump is proposing to dismantle the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, which together provided more than $2.8 million in Maine last year.
The NEH awarded $1.65 million to Maine institutions in 2016 through the Maine Humanities Council, which relies on the NEH for 73 percent of its budget, said executive director Hayden Anderson.
Recent NEH-funded projects include the council's $145,000 14th Amendment project, which last year challenged artists and humanities organizations to create work relating to the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which addresses equal protection. It granted the Maine State Museum $275,000 to digitize 100,000 pages of historic Maine newspapers.
Another $300,000 is helping the Maine Historical Society install a solar energy system at a warehouse storage facility that it jointly operates with the Portland Public Library. Since 2013, the NEH has given the University of Maine $339,400 to digitize an unpublished Penobscot language dictionary, create a revised and expanded database, and prepare a web-based and print dictionary.
The NEA spends about $1.2 million in Maine each year. That money supports staff at the Maine Arts Commission, programs such as Poetry Out Loud, and individual artists and arts organizations, who compete for about $500,000 in grants -- some as little as $500, some $50,000 or more.
Maine composer Daniel Sonenberg wrote to Collins on Thursday, objecting to Trump's budget. Sonenberg used $15,000 in NEA money to help complete his opera "The Summer King," which will premiere in late April in Pittsburgh.
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which gets $485 million annually and distributes most of that to local public broadcasters, would lose all funding. Maine's statewide public radio and television broadcaster, Maine Public, would lose $1.7 million, or 14 percent of its annual budget.
The loss of such a large chunk of its budget would be "very serious" but would not mean the network's five TV stations and 12 radio stations would "go away," said Mark Vogelzang, Maine Public's CEO. He said Maine Public is in better shape than some public broadcasters because of a $30 million fundraising campaign that began in 2013 and is nearly complete. If federal funding is cut, Maine Public could draw on the funds to fill future budget gaps, although some of it already has been used to buy stations and equipment for the broadcaster's five-station Maine Public Classical radio network.
"We started (the fundraising campaign) to build Maine Public Classical, to build up our journalism and our digital efforts, and to keep the network strong in the face of the kind of threat we're now facing," Vogelzang said.

Trump wants to eliminate this federal-state partnership, which provides funding for infrastructure, land preservation, workforce training and public services in distressed communities in the "Northern Forest region" of Maine and three other states.
The commission, founded by an act of Congress in 2008, has invested $8 million in the region since 2010, including $250,000 to help Acme Monaco expand in Presque Isle, another $250,000 to three St. John Valley towns to build boat landings and picnic areas for the 2014 World Acadian Congress, $250,000 to upgrade a roadway to attract investment in a Jay stone quarry, and $200,000 to help Van Buren build a vegetable processing plant for local farmers to expand their markets.
"It's been a very valuable source of economic development dollars for Aroostook County," said Jon Gullver, director of innovation and community relations at the Northern Maine Development Commission in Caribou.
The military would see a staggering increase in funding under Trump's proposal. The budget adds $52 billion to the Department of Defense budget, restoring it to the level before cuts made under former President Barack Obama took hold.
Bath Iron Works, the biggest defense contractor in Maine, could benefit from increased defense funding. The shipbuilder relies on military contracts for the bulk of work done there, and Trump has pledged to rebuild military assets, including Navy ships.
If Trump follows through on his pledge to rebuild all areas of the military, including deferred maintenance of equipment and adding new supplies and munitions, that could be good news for other defense contractors.
Pratt & Whitney has a facility in Berwick that produces components for the F-35 fighter, though Trump has criticized that program in recent months. A number of smaller engineering and contracting firms in Maine have won defense contracts in recent years.
Spokesmen for both BIW and Pratt & Whitney declined to comment on the budget.
The Department of Veterans Affairs would receive a 6 percent increase in programming funds for the next fiscal year, and a state veterans advocate said there is no question the increased funding will help veterans services in Maine.
"Absolutely, in the long run, it'll be good for us," said Gary Laweryson, of Waldoboro, a retired Marine who is chairman of the Maine Veterans Coordinating Committee. "It's up to us to make sure they use it the right way." The funding boost could allow for some expansion and rehabilitation of buildings at VA Maine Healthcare Systems-Togus, the federal hospital campus outside Augusta, he said.
Trump's plan also calls for $4.6 billion in new funding to improve patient access and timeliness of medical care services. Laweryson said that might help provide additional resources to help rural Maine veterans. "We need to be able to get our rural veterans to the clinics to receive care," he said. "Maybe this means (veterans' agencies) can hire more drivers for additional routes."

Full text: Urchinomics uses kelp-based food to trigger production of the valuable uni in weeks
What do First Nation villages in Quebec, barren kelp beds in Western Australia, Japanese seafood giant Mitsubishi and a Norwegian investment firm all have in common? The humble sea urchin, and restoring the underwater kelp forests the voracious creature feeds on.
In many parts of the world, sea urchin populations have rebounded and they are systematically clear-cutting kelp forests. Once that happens, they stop producing uni, the roe that sells for $200 a pound. But they survive in a hibernation state, preventing kelp from regrowing. Sea urchin divers leave them alone because the urchins are no longer profitable to harvest.
That's the problem Brian Tsuyoshi Takeda set out to solve when he founded Urchinomics, a revolutionary way to farm sea urchins from the barrens by feeding them a kelp-based food product that triggers production of uni in weeks rather than months.
Urchinomics then monitors the kelp forest restoration process in the area where the farming takes place.
Takeda's brainchild is in the trial stage today in Quebec and the Canadian Maritimes, British Columbia, Australia and Japan. It works where the sea urchin ecosystem has been affected by environmental forces that eliminate the animals that eat sea urchins.
On the North American west coast, starfish wasting disease killed a major predator of urchins and the population of the spiny shellfish spiked to the point of clear-cutting the kelp beds. The same is happening, for reasons that include global warming and overfishing of other species, in Australia, Japan, Europe, South America and elsewhere.
In order to make this work, Takeda needed to come up with an alternative feed that provided the same nutrients as kelp. Enter Nofima, a leading food science and research firm in Norway that had developed a kelp-based food for farmed urchins.
Takeda's Kaston International, an investment firm that owns rights to Urchinomics and whose president is Takeda, partnered with Nofima to share the proprietary formula with others who are restoring kelp beds and farming urchins.
In trials over the past few years, the special feed triggers roe growth of 25 percent -- the ideal ratio for commercial sales -- in 12-16 weeks.
Last June Mitsubishi's Nosan Corp. sent a group of scientists to Norway to learn about the feed and its application in Japan, where kelp beds on the west coast were devastated by the 2011 tsunami.
Last November, Takeda signed an agreement with the Ekuanitshit Nation in Quebec to begin a pilot project. The 400-member band lives on an island and struggles economically.
Takeda believes that the project could offer them a lifeline. "If they succeed, it will give young people an economic base without (moving) into the cities," he says.
Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans began a trial this year in northern Vancouver Island. The DFO study will use about 2,000 green and 1,000 red urchins harvested by divers from the Strait of Georgia and fed in trays suspended in the ocean near the station.
In Australia's southeast coast, along New South Wales and Victoria to eastern Tasmania, infestations of long-spined sea urchins, likely because of warming oceans and overfishing of predators, are turning undersea kelp forests to barren wastelands. Here, Urchinomics partnered with Hobart's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies and local aquaculture companies to take urchins from the barrens and fatten them on special feeding cages suspended from existing oyster or mussel lines.
Takeda, who was born in Japan, moved to Canada when he was a child, and now lives with his Norwegian wife in western Norway, says the various pilot projects have produced market-grade uni that has been tested in Tokyo on a trial basis so far.
He expects production will be up to commercial volumes by the end of 2017.
"If all goes well," Takeda says, "I think Japan will start producing farmed urchins from barrens by Q4 2017. I am hoping Canada would do so as well, but that is entirely dependent on the feed being locally manufactured to our specs by then."
"We are hoping to sign a licensed feed manufacturing agreement that covers North America by next month."
Throughout the process of getting sea urchins in production of high-quality roe, Takeda never loses sight of the other goals of his enterprise -- improving kelp forest ecosystems and providing meaningful employment in rural communities.
"I think this is perhaps as important as everything else ... I think we tackle overfishing in a completely different way," he said.

Full text: Senators submit bill to help aging Mainers
PORTLAND ï¿½ Senators from Maine and Hawaii say a proposal they are submitting would help make it easier for seniors to grow older in their own homes.
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, and Sen. Angus King, an independent, of Maine, are joined by Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, in proposing the changes. The senators say the Senior Home Modification Assistance Initiative Act would better coordinate existing federal home modification programs.
The senators say their proposal also would provide more consumer-friendly information on how the programs can benefit seniors.
Scalloping ground closes for season
PERRY ï¿½ Fishing regulators are shutting down Maineï¿½s most productive scallop fishing grounds for the season to protect the valuable shellfish.
Cobscook Bay is the most important scalloping area along the Maine coast. Maine marine resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher says it needs to be shut down for the season on Sunday to make sure it stays fertile. Maineï¿½s scallop season runs from December to April, but the closure of Cobscook typically represents a slowing down of the season. Maine fishermen harvested more than 530,000 pounds of scallops in 2016. That was the second-most productive scallop fishing year in the state since 2001.

Abstract: Among the targeted programs are the National Marine Fisheries Service and National Weather Service, which each would see 5 percent cuts; the satellite division, which would face a 22 percent reduction in funding, and the Sea Grant program, which would be abolished. According to a NOAA analysis released in January, the $67.3 million in federal funding spent on Sea Grant in 2015 helped support $575 million in economic development and over 20,000 jobs nationwide.

Full text: Though funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration amounts to less than one-half of 1 percent of federal spending, it pays outsize dividends for Maine. The people at the center of our state's $700 million commercial fishing industry depend on NOAA's weather forecasts, research and fisheries management services. A proposal to slash the agency's budget is a short-sighted move that would save pennies now only to forfeit dollars later.
The White House plan, first reported last week in The Washington Post, would roll back NOAA's budget by 17 percent. Among the targeted programs are the National Marine Fisheries Service and National Weather Service, which each would see 5 percent cuts; the satellite division, which would face a 22 percent reduction in funding, and the Sea Grant program, which would be abolished.
None of this is good news for Maine's marine sector. National Weather Service wind and wave height forecasts are essential to fishermen. So is the research conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which guides decisions about where, how and when to fish and enables fishermen to build business plans around their catch. What's more, the steep reductions in the satellite division's budget would deprive the weather and fisheries management offices of data that are crucial to their mission, compounding the harm done by the relatively small direct cuts to the programs themselves.
And it doesn't say much for the much-touted real-world business savvy of the Trump team that they'd propose gutting the Sea Grant program, the marine equivalent of the federal extension and research service for farmers. The University of Maine gets $1.2 million from NOAA to run Sea Grant and leverages $600,000 more from the state and other sources. But as Island Institute President Rob Snyder told the Press Herald, "They're not just an agency that's funded and sits in Orono."
In Maine, Sea Grant has funded studies on how to monitor juvenile lobsters so researchers can more reliably predict the health of the stock; helped monitor and mitigate the marine pests that afflict shellfish harvests; and provided mussel, scallop and kelp farmers with research and methodological expertise. According to a NOAA analysis released in January, the $67.3 million in federal funding spent on Sea Grant in 2015 helped support $575 million in economic development and over 20,000 jobs nationwide.
Congressional and White House budget talks have yet to start, so the final numbers could change. But given how deeply the NOAA spending cuts could disrupt the functioning of the fishing industry, it's important for Mainers to make their opposition to the proposal clear, as soon and as often as they can.

Full text: Speaker wonï¿½t convene ethics committee
PORTLAND ï¿½ Maineï¿½s Democratic House speaker said she wonï¿½t convene a committee to investigate whether the House chairman of the taxation committee violated ethics rules for working for a ballot referendum campaign.
Republican Rep. Heather Sirocki asked House Speaker Sara Gideon to convene the House ethics committee to consider whether Democratic Rep. Ryan Tipping has a conflict of interest for accepting at least $9,000 from a group that successfully pushed for a new income surtax to fund public schools.
Gideon told Sirocki in a letter Friday sheï¿½s confident Tipping will continue to serve as a fair committee chairman. Sirocki works in the dental field and Gideon said she introduced related bills.
Sirocki didnï¿½t immediately comment Friday.
A state ethics commission cleared Tippingï¿½s employment. Republicans wanted legislators to review his conduct.
Scallop fishing areas to close temporarily
PORTLAND ï¿½ Maine fishing regulators are temporarily closing several scallop fishing areas beginning this weekend to prevent the valuable shellfish from over-harvest.
WCSH-TV reported the state Department of Marine Resources closures take effect on Sunday for the Damariscotta River in Lincoln County, North Haven and mid-Penobscot Bay.
The closures will also take place in the Lower Blue Hill Bay and Jericho Bay area, and the Chandler Bay and Head Harbor area.
The closures are typical of the stateï¿½s highly regulated scallop fishing season, which ends in early spring.
The state uses the closures to ensure that different areas around the state donï¿½t become overexploited.
Scallops typically sell for $20 to $25 per pound to consumers at markets and grocery stores.
Hand harvest will be allowed in the Damariscotta River area.

Climate change a threat to Maine

Full text: AS MAINE HAS struggled to build a 21st-century economy, we've faced many challenges, most of them man-made and some geographic. We've been painfully slow to accept how the world was changing around us, and unwilling to hear the warnings of economists about how manufacturing, forestry, farming and fishing would change.
Instead, we've spent too much of our time locked in senseless battles based on region and political differences and whether we live in cities or the countryside. And we've watched as the state's economy has lost momentum and energy, and our young people have left.
Now we're doing a similar thing with climate change. We've been reluctant to heed the warnings of scientists who study these things every day. We've ignored the signs that are appearing all around us. We've confused political views with facts. Because of those things, the challenges for Maine, and for our economy, are growing.
Now we're not only cold, remote, expensive, disorganized, discouraged and disgruntled; we're also ill-informed.
Climate change is going to alter much of what we now see in our minds when we think of Maine. Some familiar things will become rare, while others that we have little experience with will seem to be everywhere. Think of ticks, peach trees, new plant diseases, possums, vultures and insect-borne diseases.
Some people still maintain that climate change isn't real, and they've employed a string of senseless and sometimes dishonest arguments to make their point. They've ridiculed computer projections, derided scientists, blamed cow flatulence and dead trees -- anything but the role that burning coal, gas and oil plays. Now they say that climate change is a conspiracy among all of the world's scientists, engineered by China.
Losing ground in the public debate, climate deniers are now moving toward another strategy, led by the new president. Silence science. Cut funding to agencies, like NASA and NOAA, who collect and publish temperature data from around the world. Book burning can't be far behind.
The problem with gagging scientists, from an economic standpoint, is that it will leave American businesses flying blind against global competitors who aren't. And while they're building technologies for the future, we'll be re-opening coal mines.
Most common-sense people seem to understand that our climate is changing and that burning fossil fuels over the last hundred years or so is the major culprit.
Here's what the scientists -- while they're still free to speak -- have been telling us.
[bullet] 2016 was the warmest year on record, beating out 2015, which beat out 2014. Sixteen of the last 17 years have produced global temperature records.
[bullet] Alaska and New England are warming faster than the rest of the country.
[bullet] New England will feel impacts 20 years earlier than other places.
[bullet] Our average annual temperature will rise by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over historical levels within 20 years, making us more like southern New England than Maine.
[bullet] The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than almost any place on the planet.
[bullet] Sea levels in New England could rise by as much as 10.5 feet by 2100, or twice what was earlier predicted. That would put 30 percent of Boston and many parts of our coastline under water.
What does all of that mean for the Maine economy? Warming climates force everything to migrate north -- plants, trees, animals, insects, diseases and people. Already, we've seen Maine's iconic cod pushed farther offshore and northward. That's why you're not buying much cod at the supermarket that was landed in Portland or New Bedford. Most of it now comes from Iceland and Norway.
Next up will be lobsters and other shellfish. Lobstering is booming now, in part because southern lobsters have moved in. But they won't stop moving. Connecticut, not so long ago, had 300 lobsterman. Today there are only about half a dozen. In Rhode Island, lobstering is virtually non-existent.
In agriculture, forestry and recreation, we can expect longer growing seasons but more rain, icy winters and far less snow. That will release and sustain both diseases and insects we're not prepared for. Think about explosions of ticks, new flying insects, tree and plant diseases. Then add human diseases we have no experience with.
Humans also will migrate, with the possibility of waves of people seeking refuge in places like Maine, while escaping heat and violent storms to the south. While Maine needs more skilled people to grow the economy, let's face it, managing change has not been our strong suit.
The most immediate and compelling challenge we face is that our political leadership, in Maine and in the White House, just doesn't get it.

Well, Christmas is over and winter is really here. Some people actually like winter for all sorts of reasons. A few believe winter is good for only two things -- long afternoon naps and soup-making. And Kathy Gunst likes soup.
Gunst lives in southern Maine and is an award-winning food journalist and author of 14 cookbooks. "Soup Swap" is a clever soup cookbook with a nice entertainment twist -- simple tips for hosting soup parties where guests bring homemade soups to share, with enough left over to take home. The book contains 62 soup recipes with additional recipes for side dishes and soup garnishes.
Gunst smartly includes soup recipes for all types of soups -- hot or cold, dairy-free, gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan soups. She advocates for making your own soup stock, too, because you can control how much sodium you want (canned and boxed stocks are often heavily salted).
Gunst convinces you that soup-making is easy. Once you've completed a few preliminary preparations, "mostly soup does its own thing."
Sections highlight broths and stocks, vegetable soups, chicken and turkey soups, meat soups, and fish and seafood soups and chowders. Vegetable soups include recipes for pumpkin, chestnut, carrot and mushroom soups, as well as the No Cream Cream of Celery Root Soup. Chicken soups include chicken soup with matzo balls, which she calls "Jewish penicillin" because it is so healthy.
Meat soups (meat in moderation) include Portuguese kale, white bean and chorizo soup, as well as lamb and lentil soup. And of course, for seafood she features oyster stew, cioppino, and sausage and clam stew.
Helpful sidebars reveal how to easily remove that layer of fat from a pot of meat stock, and why you should always cook pasta and rice separately before adding to any soup.

In 1985, 10 police officers in Portland's Special Reaction Team tried to arrest four armored car robbers. In a wild gunfight, one policeman and three robbers are killed, but one robber and $1.4 million disappeared.
Detective Sergeant John Byron's father was a member of the SRT in that shootout, and he's never forgotten what happened to his father. Decades later, Byron is a homicide detective with the Portland Police Department, a 20-year veteran, a boozer and risk-taker, soon to be divorced.
"Among The Shadows" is the debut mystery by Bruce Coffin, a real homicide detective recently retired from the PPD. For a first novel, Coffin's Detective Sergeant Byron is in good company with Maine mystery writer Kate Flora's Portland detective Joe Burgess and his many excellent mysteries.
This is a complex, but well-structured plot with careful foreshadowing and subtle red herrings to keep the reader guessing. Coffin clearly has storytelling talent and is already working on a sequel to this suspenseful, fast-paced and entertaining mystery.
The unattended death of a retired cop is mildly interesting to Byron, but the murder of another retired cop gets his attention, especially when he discovers both victims were members of that 1985 SRT.
Byron and his partner, Detective Diane Joyner, quickly find themselves in a tricky and deadly dilemma -- their investigation has attracted the unwelcome and obstructive attention of the department's top brass, and they suddenly realize there are very few fellow officers they can trust. A cooperative FBI agent helps level the field, but there are hidden dangers there, too.
As more dead bodies stack up, frightening connections appear, and Byron now wonders about the real circumstances of his father's apparent suicide in 1985. And there may be more than a killer just steps away.
Bill Bushnell lives and writes in Harpswell.

Full text:   UMaine System likely to produce only half of graduates needed
Maine schools will not graduate enough engineers in the next decade to keep up with projected demand, and the shortfall could hamper the state's economic growth.
That's the consensus of engineering professionals and educators who believe that better pay outside Maine will lure graduates away while the state struggles to expand its capacity to train engineers here.
The Maine economy has gained more than 800 new engineering jobs in the last decade, expanding a foundation for high-tech industries, construction and manufacturing. Each engineer working in Maine right now adds $560,000 to Maine's gross domestic product, according to a University of Maine analysis.
But the University of Maine System will produce only half the graduates needed to fill open engineering jobs in the next decade, mostly to replace people who have retired. About 27 percent of Maine's engineering workforce is 55 or older, said Dana Humphrey, dean of the University of Maine College of Engineering in Orono, laying the groundwork for impending shortages. With intense national competition for recent engineering graduates, Maine companies look primarily to the college to recruit new employees.
"If Maine thinks it can solve its shortage of engineers by bringing them in from other places, it is not going to happen," Humphrey added. "It is going to have to produce its own."
Though there is surging interest in engineering from students, the college is stretched to its limits. For the first time, the school had to turn away students from their preferred area of study in 2016, Humphrey said, and that trend is likely to continue.
"We are bursting at the seams," he said.
A recent projection from the university for 2026 estimates Maine will create 810 new engineering jobs and need to replace 1,750 retiring engineers, plus others who leave the workforce, creating about 2,560 openings in all. At the same time, Maine is expected to produce 1,300 graduates to work in the state, leaving a shortfall of at least 1,260. Currently about 60 percent of Maine engineering graduates stay in the state.
"We need every engineer we can get plus more. It doesn't matter the discipline," Humphrey said.
Rick McCarthy, executive director of the American Council of Engineering Companies of Maine, echoed Humphrey's call for more engineering graduates. He said areas such as Boston and parts of California are booming, thanks in part to the critical mass of talented engineers.
"The best way to get those jobs here is to train them here, with the expectation that they stay," McCarthy said.
But he acknowledges when it comes to pay, Maine lags behind many states. The average annual wage for engineering positions in Maine is $72,300, compared to a national average of almost $83,000, according to the U.S. Census Occupational Survey.
Meagan Lewis, a 2016 University of Maine graduate, said higher salary was a reason she took a job as a systems engineer at MITRE Corp., a not-for-profit government contractor in Virginia. The company also had opportunities she couldn't find in Maine, Lewis said. Many of her other friends from Maine also found jobs out of state.
"A few of them just wanted to get out of Maine. They had been there their whole lives. Why not see a different part of the country?" Lewis said. "The ones who stayed wanted to stay closer to home."
That's Gregory Smiddy's situation. Smiddy, who will graduate from the University of Maine in May, already has a job lined up at the Pratt and Whitney aircraft turbine plant in North Berwick. The job lets him work in aviation and keeps him in Maine, close to his family, Smiddy said.
"I really lucked out; I couldn't be happier with my position once I get out of school," Smiddy said. "To be able to stay in Maine and have a job I really like is something else. It is amazing."
UMaine is the dominant source for engineering degrees in the state, although some are given at the University of Southern Maine and Maine Maritime Academy in Castine. Enrollment at UMaine's engineering school has increased 74 percent since 2001. Humphrey said about 1,800 undergraduate and 200 postgraduate students attend the engineering college. An incoming freshman class has 450 to 500 students.
The university has invested in state-of-the-art research laboratories such as the Advanced Structures and Composites Center, Humphrey said, but its five academic buildings are aging and cramped, and they have laboratory space that is functionally obsolete.
"Our buildings do need to be upgraded, modern facilities to be compatible with how we teach today, not 20 years ago," Humphrey said.
The University of Southern Maine has approximately doubled its enrollment in the past decade to 200 and expects continued growth, said Mariusz Jankowski, chairman of the school's engineering department.
"Both institutions recognize the need for increased investment in engineering," Jankowski said. "I would certainly hope that message gets across, and the solution is that we use the opportunity to invest in both institutions, when the decision is made to increase access to engineering in Maine."
That infrastructure is critical to producing engineers in a competitive landscape.
"If the University of Maine is not able to pump them out or is compromised because of a lack of capabilities or other resources, it will further compromise our ability to hire those engineers and hopefully keep them in the state of Maine," said Chuck Padera, president of Kleinschmidt, a 140-employee firm based in Pittsfield with offices in seven states and two Canadian provinces. "Right now, if you are graduating from a qualified engineering school, you get to pick where you want to go; the world truly is your oyster."
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the economy will add 67,200 new architecture and engineering jobs, a 3 percent increase, by 2024. According to a 2016 survey from human resources firm ManpowerGroup, 82 percent of companies reported having difficulty finding engineers, even though 95 percent said they were planning to hire in 2016. The survey pointed to problems similar to those in Maine, such as a workforce facing retirement age and a need for more education and training of new engineers.
"It is clear the demand for engineers is growing very, very rapidly and has been growing over the past number of years across the country," said David Raymond, president and CEO of the American Council of Engineering Companies. Expanded demand for engineers in new industries such as high tech and biotechnology is helping drive the need to produce more graduates across the country, Raymond added.
"The real question is demand," Raymond said. "If demand is sustainable, then the institutions will find a way to fill it."
In a busy market, small firms such as Acorn Engineering in Portland have a particularly tough time recruiting new hires. A glut of engineers during the recession turned into a shortage as the economy improved, Acorn owner William Savage said. His company wasn't advertising open jobs, but he recently hired a University of Maine graduate who sent a handwritten letter expressing interest in the company's watershed restoration work.
"Everyone is trying to hire engineers; we can't pass up that opportunity. We hired him on the spot," Savage said. "That is the mentality right now."

Full text:   Maine university plans anti-hate rally
PORTLAND -- The University of Southern Maine's multicultural affairs office is hosting an anti-hate rally in Portland in response to anti-Muslim sentiment around the country, including an incident at the university.
The gathering is scheduled for today at noon at the university's Woodbury Campus Center. The university said the purpose of the event is to declare Portland and Maine as a "hate-free zone."
Officials at the university investigated an incident last month in which graffiti was found in student senate offices that appeared to express anti-Muslim sentiment.
Organizers of the anti-hate event said representatives from more than 20 faiths and community groups will gather on today.
Sustain, Override dogs top LePage's wish list
AUGUSTA -- GOP Gov. Paul LePage wants to get two new canine buddies named Sustain and Override for his dogs Jack and Veto.
LePage's dogs made an appearance on his weekly interview on WVOM-FM. The dogs barked in the background Tuesday as LePage criticized a newly approved 3 percent surtax on Maine individual incomes above $200,000.
LePage wants to cut Maine's top marginal rate, but said Tuesday he won't propose a sales tax increase.
The governor laughed as he said he's trying to get his wife to allow him to get more dogs. His suggested names of Sustain and Override come as a sharply divided legislature makes its way to Augusta.
Portland OKs contract granting pay raises
PORTLAND -- The Portland City Council has approved a new contract with the city's largest union that will increase wages by $1.1 million over the next three years.
The Portland Press Herald reported the agreement with roughly 500 workers in the City Employee Benefits Association was approved Monday and provides annual increases of 2 percent.
CEBA represents most permanent employees, except for firefighters and police officers.
The contract with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1373 is set to expire on June 30, 2019.
Compiled from wire reports
The city's current budget authorizes 1,283 employees with a municipal payroll of $72.5 million.
Maine's scallop season starts with draggers
PORTLAND -- Maine's scallop fishing season is in full swing with dragger boats now allowed to harvest the valuable shellfish.
Scallops have been increasing in price around the country, and Maine's are some of the most valuable. The dragger fishing season began on Monday.
The season runs until April, but is subject to early closures based on how abundant the scallops are. The most productive scallop fishing grounds in the state are in Cobscook Bay on Maine's eastern coast.
Maine scallops reached their highest price at the dock last year at $12.70 per pound. The price to consumers was typically in the $20 to $25 per pound range.
Some Maine fishermen harvest scallops by diving for them. That season began on Dec. 1.
Fishermen allowed same catch of crabs
NEW BEDFORD, Mass. -- Federal regulators say East Coast fishermen will be allowed to catch the same amount of deep sea red crabs in the next few years.
Deep sea red crabs can inhabit depths of nearly 6,000 feet in the Atlantic Ocean and are fished off of New England and the mid-Atlantic. They are harvested for use as fresh picked crab meat and frozen crab legs.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says fishermen will be allowed to catch nearly 4 million pounds of the crabs in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The crabs are brought to shore mostly in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Norfolk, Virginia.
NOAA says catch was below quota in recent years, but has been increasing. The agency says scientists believe continuing the current volume of catch won't cause overfishing.

Full text:   or individuals, as opposed to policymakers, the journey to sustainability often comes not in big leaps but in small steps. With these 13 gift ideas, turn your back on our rampant throw-away culture, but still welcome beauty and functionality into the lives of friends and family. Transformation can begin with something as simple as a set of sewing scissors or ladies' gardening gloves. Leave commercialism behind this holiday season and embrace a more sustainable way of life with easy baby steps, otherwise known as green gifts.
On a recent Saturday we climbed an old set of stairs in a brick building in Hallowell to get to Merrill's Bookshop, looking for a specific Maine classic. It took proprietor John Merrill less than a minute to locate Elizabeth Etnier's 1937 memoir of trying to restore an old Maine house that overlooks Fort Popham, "On Gilbert Head: Maine Days." It's a hard one to find, and there it was, in good condition at a reasonable price. Then we started browsing the rest of the shelf. There was Robert P. T. Coffin's poetry collection "Saltwater Farm," also from 1937, and a copy of "Pie for Breakfast" (with the dust jacket no less), Lawrence and Marion Averill's 1953 story of making a life in Maine. Here's what we love about John Merrill: He doesn't sell online, he keeps his shop in exquisite order, and his collection has depth and breadth. We snagged the Etnier and a fine hardback of "Watership Down," both at 20 percent off that day, resisted an Arthur Ransome we'd never before seen except in paperback, and vowed to come back to browse this unique and special bookstore again. Why shop online booksellers from far away to find what might be close to home? And honestly, we want to sustain the old-fashioned business. Grab a book for someone you love (cash or check only), or give them a gift certificate so they can browse this beautifully curated store. -- MARY POLS

HOW MUCH: Depends on the title
Stopping by Cosmic Stone and Garden Supply in Topsham to pick up a holiday wreath, we were struck by a collection of simple and beautiful birdbaths (pictured above). When we asked about them, manager Howard Truesdell told us that the rocks came from Bailey Island, where Cosmic Stone had been hired to do a reclamation project that required jagged rocks. They had to pull out some older, wave-softened rocks and decided to turn them into birdbaths. The gentle indentations were carefully ground into the rocks with tools, but at first glance they look like something nature created. Why buy something manufactured to give your songbird friends a place to bathe when you can use something repurposed from nature? -- MP

HOW MUCH: Prices start at $140 for a small bath.
Every gardener needs a good pair of gloves, but it's hard to find ones that last more than a season or two. It's also hard to find American-made gloves. Womanswork gloves are both, made from leather, sized appropriately for women and sold in two lengths, to the wrist and in extra-long length for chores like tending your roses or picking raspberries (next summer, we are determined to avoid that rash from whatever else is growing in our raspberry patch). -- MP

HOW MUCH: Prices direct from the manufacturer, womanswork.com, start at $30 for regular length, but you can also spring for the $46 gauntlet length.
We like Mason jars as much as the next farm-to-table loving person, but frankly, Weck jars from Germany have always struck us as a little sexier, what with those nice glass lids. But they're not particularly secure (yeah, they come with safety clips ... when is the last time you saw yours?). Weck sells "keep fresh" covers (weckjars.com), but they're plastic. Now someone ingenious (not Weck) is making wooden lids with a rubber ring for a tight seal so that you can get more use out of these pretty jars, like storing dried herbs from the garden or that bag of wheat berries from Fairwinds Farm.
Lids come in three sizes that fit all shapes and sizes of Weck. -- MP

Eliza Jane Curtis' whimsical printed Morris + Essex scarves are made on sustainable bamboo-cotton jersey fabric (bamboo being a more eco-friendly fiber because it can be grown without pesticides). She also uses nontoxic, water-based textile inks. Oh, and she hand-prints them all in a farmhouse in Limington. The story is a good one, but the truth is, we were drawn to these scarves purely for aesthetic reasons the first time we spotted them this summer at the North Haven Gift Shop. Then we saw them at Local. The designs are fanciful and densely packed (we guessed the name might be a nod to famed 19th century British textile designer William Morris, but Curtis says though she is a great admirer, she was inspired by an old railway map) and the drape is perfection. Curtis also makes tea towels, bags, greeting cards and T-shirts. She might be the next Angela Adams. -- MP

Foraging is all the rage, with seemingly half the transplants from Brooklyn signing on to "wild harvest" Maine edibles. But as easy a target as it is to mock, the skill can net you dinner, help you out on a hike and give you something to talk about over cocktails at Vinland. Consider giving your loved one a class at the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy, or at the Maine Primitive Skills School in Augusta (they've got a two-day class scheduled for January. We wondered, what can you forage in January in Maine? Bark, which they'll teach you how to make sunscreen from. Seriously. Also rose hips and a few other things). -- MP
FIND IT: Also Maine Adult Education, Merrymeeting Adult Education and other adult education programs throughout the state.
HOW MUCH: A mushroom foraging walk at the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy might cost you $15, and a typical three-hour adult education course might cost about $45. The Maine Primitive Skills School's two-day class in January costs $210.
We're on an endless quest to pack a sustainable lunch and haven't gotten the whole thing right yet. At least with stainless steel containers, we don't have to worry about leaching plastics, but what about the microwaving? Glass containers work for that, but what about the weight and crack factor? But one thing that makes us very, very happy is our stainless steel Onyx ice pack. It chills lunch without taking up a lot of space (it's about the size of a smartphone) and there's no fear that it will rupture or melt into your lunch. Also, if you bonk your head, reach for this; it will chill you right out. We know steel production isn't exactly dreamy for the environment, but at least it lasts, so we've got our eye on a stainless steel ice cube tray too, which is insanely expensive ($30) but would liberate us from the cursed plastic trays. -- MP

Never too early for a New Year's resolution, and ours is to darn more and stretch out the lives of socks and holey jeans. We want to make what we've already got last longer. We thought about suggesting a sewing kit, but the truth is you don't need much more than a needle, thread and a scissors, and our serious sewing friends tend to scoff at pre-fabbed kits. Maybe a motivator would be the world's prettiest scissors? These would be they, in the image of a crane shaped with a gentle swoop and the blades as beak. The best little touch? The note on the blades. "Oh, Hello Friend." Indeed. -- MP

Erin Flett's cute red-dot-covered lumbar pillow had us feeling festive just based on its looks. But then we poked around and discovered that Flett is making all her pillows (and bags, aprons and such) in the Dana Warp Mill in Westbrook, a former cotton mill, out of American-made materials - even the zippers. She prints by hand in Maine and uses mills in North Carolina to weave her custom bark cloth and canvas (which is what this one is made from), while sourcing linens and velvets domestically. The insert is hypo-allergenic "faux" down. -- MP

Winter is just getting started when Christmas rolls around, but that's all the more reason to throw something signifying hope for warm weather into the stocking. Plus, maybe your loved ones will be inspired to start seedlings indoors in March instead of being garden slatterns, as we are, and only getting outside to plant come early June. In Maine we've got some great seed companies to choose from - Fedco and Johnny's Selected Seeds, although word of caution, not everything is available pre-Christmas or Hanukkah, since they're still making the seed packets. -- MP

Full text:   Maine scientists are decrying the assertion by a senior adviser to President-elect Donald Trump that the new administration will eliminate or dramatically scale back NASA's climate research.
The scientists say the elimination of the agency's earth science programs would be catastrophic for climate science research in Maine, impairing their ability to detect and analyze effects on fisheries, forests and agriculture. Maine is a hub of climate research -- especially as it relates to the oceans -- and the work relies on the data collected by NASA satellites and processed by the agency's experts.
"If we lose these data sets and capabilities, that will be a major loss to us being able to monitor and track changes here in Maine and in other areas that impact us," said Andrew Thomas, a professor of oceanography at the University of Maine's School of Marine Sciences, which receives more than a sixth of its research funds from NASA. "Basically, you're chopping off one of your arms and saying, 'Carry on.'" The school's Satellite Data Lab is using NASA data to analyze effects of melting ice in the Gulf of Alaska and to monitor marine algae production in the California Current.
Bob Walker, a former Pennsylvania congressman who serves as Trump's space policy adviser, said in interviews last week that the administration would realign NASA's budget, prioritizing exploration of "deep space" over space-based observations of Earth, which he has previously characterized as "politically correct environmental monitoring." Earth observations would instead be made by the National Science Foundation or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, two much smaller agencies with little experience or expertise in space-based climate monitoring.
Trump himself has previously described climate change as a hoax "created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive," though he more recently conceded there was "some connectivity" between human actions and the climate. With Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, Trump will likely have a free hand to halt NASA climate research, which has expanded substantially under President Obama.
Walker, who was considered to lead NASA under President George W. Bush, said last week that he "would like to be in the position of backing sound science not politicized science" and claimed, erroneously, that there was widespread disagreement among climate scientists as to whether climate change was linked to human activity.
Andrew Pershing, chief science officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, takes issue with Walker's characterization of climate-related research as "politicized."
"That's just not true," said Pershing, whose research revealed that the Gulf of Maine has been warming faster than any other part of the world oceans since 2004, save a section of ocean current north of Japan. "Climate science is just science. The approach that's led to our understanding of how carbon dioxide works on our planet is the same approach that led to the DNA revolution, cellphones and all the other stuff we have in our daily lives."
Pershing's colleagues at GMRI are building models of how fish move in response to changing ocean conditions. "Satellites really give us the ability to look at what is going on and how the fish, animals and plants in the ocean are responding," he said. "The world needs good science to provide the evidence we need to figure out what we are going to do over the next century."
A sharp reduction in NASA research would have economic effects as well, said Thomas of the University of Maine. Climate science is an area in which Maine researchers have world-wide reputations, he said, with dozens of them employed at Maine, GMRI and the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay. "We're talking people losing jobs and grad students who can't show up because there isn't funding to take them on. There are millions of dollars that go into the local economy that won't happen."
Barney Balch, a Bigelow biological oceanographer who has led long-term NASA-funded monitoring of the tiny plants at the base of the Gulf of Maine's food chain, said such cuts would be comparable to "taking the stethoscope away from the doctor." (Disclosure: This reporter is a Bigelow trustee.)
"The key measurements we use to discern change in organisms in the oceans -- sea surface temperature, salinity, ocean color -- they all pretty much exclusively fall under NASA," Balch said. "Other countries use NASA's expertise in these areas because they are so good at it."
The proposed changes wouldn't directly affect one of the most pressing climate-related issues for Maine, the increasing acidification of Gulf of Maine seawater. The more acidic conditions in near-shore waters have wreaked havoc on baby oysters' ability to build their shells and are thought to have similar effects on mussels, clams and possibly even lobsters.
Potential research and monitoring of this issue falls under NOAA, said Rep. Mick Devin, D-Newcastle, who co-chaired a legislative commission that studied the issue, meaning it would not be disrupted by potential changes at NASA.

Abstract: Based on a rule established in Colonial times -- the Massachusetts Bay Colony's Colonial Ordinance of 1641-1647 to be precise -- that gives him the right to say, build a dock in that low tide zone.

Links: http://CX2EF4JW8J.search.serialssolutions.com/directLink?&amp;atitle=ddie+Page+found+his+first+summer+in+his+new+waterfront...&amp;author=Pols%2C+Mary&amp;issn=&amp;title=Morning+Sentinel&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;date=2016-10-30&amp;spage=1.A&amp;id=doi:&amp;sid=ProQ_ss&amp;genre=article

Full text:   ddie Page found his first summer in his new waterfront home in Cundy's Harbor noisy. The peace and tranquility he was seeking was interrupted in July by the fishermen in front of his house cutting rockweed. The sound of the mechanical harvester was so loud that Page felt compelled to download an app on his smartphone to measure it. "At times we had two machines on our property, and I got 75 decibels each," Page said.
The retired accountant is a self-professed geek, so he also did some filming of the rockweed harvest. Being new to the area, Page did not understand that this is roughly the equivalent of putting your hand on the hilt of a sword. Things got heated and Page gave Brunswick-based Source Inc., the company that had hired the harvesters, a piece of his mind.
"I told them, you do not have permission to come on our property," Page said.
This is where the matter of rockweed in the intertidal zone -- a legal issue now making its way through Maine's judicial system -- gets very, very sticky. Does Page have the right to tell harvesters, not just "Get off my (seaweed) lawn," but "Stop cutting it?"
Page believes that rockweed to be his. Like every waterfront property owner in Maine, he does own all the way to his low tide line. Those ledges are his. Based on a rule established in Colonial times -- the Massachusetts Bay Colony's Colonial Ordinance of 1641-1647 to be precise -- that gives him the right to say, build a dock in that low tide zone. But he must also give way to the public when it is engaged in the acts of fishing, fowling and navigation. The fish, fowl and navigate law is unique to Maine and Massachusetts, and it's all business in a way; other states typically also allow the public to recreate below the high tide line.
It is highly unlikely that in protein-hungry Colonial times, thought was given to the matter of something as futuristic as rockweed nutritional supplements for both human beings and animals (Source Inc.'s major product) or seafood extracts from cooked down or dehydrated ground-up versions being used as organic fertilizer (some of the other products made by Maine's small but thriving group of rockweed processors).
But it's 2016. Climate change is changing how, where and what Mainers fish. Corresponding concern over sustainability is also changing how and what we eat and grow. And rockweed, that humble plant known in Latin as Ascophyllum nodosum and by nervous swimmers as the creepy stuff where the ocean boogie man hides, represents the clash of issues like nothing else. It's always been a handy soil enricher.
"People have been dragging seaweed up off the beach as long as there has been people and beaches," says George Seaver, vice president and general manager of Ocean Organics, a seaweed processor in Waldoboro.
But rockweed landings in Maine have doubled in the last 10 years, to 15 million pounds in 2015. It's not a high cash crop -- the price per pound averages 4 cents -- but as a value-added product it has become an industry with real potential, including uses that could reduce the amount of chemical fertilizers on agricultural crops. That's good, right?
Generally speaking, yes. But as the fishery has grown, so have tensions over it, including whether it should even be a fishery.
Last December, Ken and Gary Ross, Pembroke brothers whose family has owned land on Cobscook Bay since the 1900s, joined with an association of homeowners on Roque Island archipelago near Jonesport, in a suit against a Canadian harvester called Acadian Seaplants, the biggest rockweed harvester in the state. Their claim is that they own rockweed "affixed to and growing in the intertidal area." The plantiffs aren't looking for a cut of the cash; they are worried about the ecological impact of removing the rockweed, according to their attorney, Gordon Smith of Verrill Dana.
They're not exactly outliers either. The Rockweed Coalition, which Gary Ross was at one time a director of, signed on 568 properties in 12 towns to a "no-cut registry" (it now goes by the name Save Our Seaweed).
The Ross family has worked closely with Robin Hadlock Seeley, a Shoals Marine Laboratory scientist who co-authored a 2012 overview of the sustainability of the rockweed resource in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. Her report concludes that commercial-scale rockweed cutting presents a risk to both the coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them. Meaning the fisheries.
But the lawsuit isn't about the ecology per se. It's about ownership, and that is a murky question, one that a former Maine attorney general, Steven Rowe, concluded lacks a definitive answer. The state's courts have been "sympathetically generous" in interpreting what fishing is, Rowe wrote to Department of Marine Resources in 2008; but on the question as to whether seaweed falls within the public trust, it has been "inconsistent."
Here's how the seaweed story has unfolded since the Colonial Ordinance: When Maine became a state in 1820, the Massachusetts law came with it. Fish, fowl and navigate. Simple. But seaweed's place in the fish, fowl and navigation pantheon has been questioned before. In 1843, a lawsuit over trespassing to take "sea manure" found in the favor of the landowner. So did an 1861 ruling, which said seaweed "does not come within the principles applied to aquatic rights." Forty years later, in the case of Marshall v. Walker, the court seemed to reverse itself, saying of the flats that people "may dig shell fish in them, may take sea manure from them ..."
The back and forth has created a complicated legal picture, the kind that causes people anxiety about bigger ramifications. Like Greg Tobey, general manager for Source Inc. He believes that if the suit is successful, everything in the intertidal zone would be off limits, including clamming.
"If the riparian land owners gain control of that, there is not many of them going to say, 'Yeah, get what you want,'" he added.
That lament is common, but unfounded, said Gordon Smith. Clamming, musseling, worming or wrinkling (periwinkles) clearly constitute fishing, the attorney said.
"Taking any of those resources from the intertidal zone is within the scope of the public trust doctrine," Smith said.
But not, he said, rockweed.
To George Seaver, there's no question. Rockweed might not be a fish per se, but he can come up with (a semi-tortured) walks-like-a-duck analogy to argue that it should be treated as one.
"These plants, growing on the rocks, they're basically mussels with less personality," he said. "It's stuck in place by its holdfast. It gets all its nutrition from the sea."
Maine statute defines fish as both a noun and a verb. Lobster, for instance, are not fish under the definition of the noun. But the verb "fish" is described as "to take or attempt to take any marine organism by any method or means."
"So through the definitions, the taking of plants is included in the activity of fishing," Jeff Nichols, the Department of Marine Resource's director of communications, wrote in an email. Additionally, there is a statute that authorizes the commissioner to regulate the harvest of seaweed. (Of the 12 species of seaweeds harvested in Maine, rockweed constitutes about 90 percent of the annual landings.)
From Gordon Smith's perspective, the statute doesn't end the issue. "All that means is that the Legislature has, for the purposes of DMR regulation, said it considers fishing to include harvesting sea plants."
That regulation is still in its infancy. A proposed management plan for rockweed, which divides the coast into sectors, was introduced in early 2014, and all things being equal, should be moving toward finalization. It includes input from other state agencies, including the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (which protects wildlife habitat for shorebirds) and the Department of Environmental Protection (rockweed sits in a coastal wetland). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weighed in as well, citing the poor recovery of the cod fishery and the importance of the rockweed to the fish in its juvenile stage.
But the proposed plan is on hold for two reasons -- the staff member who would have taken it through the public hearing and review process left the Department of Marine Resources and hasn't been replaced and Commissioner Patrick Keliher has said publicly that until the lawsuit is resolved, he plans no further action. "From his perspective, it would not make a lot of sense to invest a lot of additional department time and resources in more complicated management measures at this time," Nichols wrote in an email, "since we expect that greater clarity on the issue of ownership will be forthcoming."
The department began imposing regulations in 2000 as the interest in harvesting rockweed commercially was growing. Permits are required, but the rules are incredibly simple. The holdfast, or base of the plant, is not to be disturbed. The haircut, as it were, must leave a minimum of 16 inches above the holdfast.
In 2014 the Department of Marine Resources estimated somewhere between 44 and 61 people were or had been harvesting rockweed in Maine, more than half of them by hand.
Harvesters, except those in Cobscook Bay, where limits are imposed, could land more rockweed and in more locations than they do now. George Seaver points out that the harvest taken annually is only about 1.5 percent of the state's rockweed biomass. "It is nowhere near what Mother Nature tears off with every ice scouring or storm every year."
Seaver's harvesters needn't travel very far. They use a machete, rather than a mechanical harvester, and wait three years before returning to a harvested area. That's not onerous because the extraction process Ocean Organics uses doesn't require bulk. "The last thing you are going to do is damage the resource within driving distance of your facility," Seaver said. "Anybody who is a responsible business person is going to be utterly respectful of the health of the resource."
The beauty of this fishery, he said, is that it's always "right where you left it last year."
It grows back, Seaver said, And thicker. Research in the Department of Marine Resources proposed management plan confirms this, as do other harvesters. Tobey recalls doing some serious rockweed trimming for his father, who was finding it tough to get his boat into his landing on Little Yarmouth Island because the weed was so thick. "Two months afterward, it doesn't even look like we touched it. It comes back insanely."
Which is why he and Seaver are frustrated by the accusation that they could be doing ecological damage. Source Inc. does not harvest during spring sporing season, for instance, and Tobey said he understands the rockweed's significance.
"If you're removing too much of the canopy, yeah," Tobey said. "Crabs, fish, shellfish, they all definitely use the rockweed as habitat."
But consider what happens when you mow your lawn, Tobey suggests. "You cut it down to 4 inches and the crickets, ants and bugs, they all scatter. But you come back an hour later and you're going to find the same crickets, ants and bugs. They are all going to be there."
Seaver jokes that Robin Hadlock Seeley is "our staunch not-supporter." She probably wouldn't argue with this. But she would argue with some of the arguments put forward by harvesters. Like the thing about Mother Nature taking more of the resource annually than the fishery does.
"All of that is feeding the system," Seeley said. "It's not like it's wasted so humans might as well go get it."
She's an eighth-generation Mainer who grew up in Freeport and spent much of her childhood on the water. In college she studied marine biology, focusing on an organism nearly as humble as rockweed, the periwinkle. While traveling the state looking for a kind of periwinkle she'd found fossiled in mortar on Appledore Island, she visited Eastport in the early 1980s.
"I hopped out of the car and there was the living form" of that fossil.
But as the invasive green crab traveled up the coast, the populations of periwinkles she'd been so excited about started to disappear. "It was like little lights going out around Cobscook Bay."
Then, she said, she'd see seaweed harvesters come in and start to "hack away" at the rockweed, taking periwinkles and other by-catch with them.
"No. 1, it makes no sense, with everything that is going on in the marine environment, to start hacking away at the habitat," Seeley said.
No. 2, her research subjects were already in trouble. "I am studying the last few of these species and now they are disappearing into the bottom of the boats."
Tobey said his mechanical harvester hardly brings in any by-catch at all. "Maybe an inch in the bottom of a fish tote."
Seeley's effort began with the periwinkle, but she's been tenacious about protecting the rockweed resource, rallying allies from a host of environmental and conservation organizations, among them Downeast Coastal Conservancy, Friends of Blue Hill Bay and Schoodic Institute. Among the groups citing the importance of restricting the harvest on seabird nesting islands was the Audubon Seabird Restoration Program, which cited rockweed's significance to Atlantic puffins and Arctic terns.
She's also the main contact for the cause. Eddie Page, who started out annoyed by noise, poked around on the internet and found Seeley. Now he thinks less about noise and more about nature.
"It's a bit like me coming onto your property and sawing a limb off your tree and saying, 'Oh, it will grow back,'" he said.
He'll be rooting for that lawsuit to make its way to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court and prove, once and for all (or until the next appeal) who the weed belongs to. In the meantime, next time the harvesters come by, he can try asking them to move on.
"We'll go around the corner," Greg Tobey said. "In order not to be an idiot, or to be rude, we'll say, 'I'm sorry. I will do what I can to be quieter.'"
But even as he's being polite, Tobey will be pondering one of those big-picture questions about Maine and its spectacular coast.
"You cannot deny the fact that waterfront homes are not owned by minimum-wage earners," he said. "By and large, most of the waterfront homes are not owned by Maine natives."
And that, he says, creates a gap in understanding that goes beyond mere communication. If the view is the priority, waterfront owners aren't going to be sympathetic to those who make their living in and around their ocean. And drive the state's economy.
Seeley poses -- and answers -- a big-picture question of her own. "Why is seaweed being taken now? It is because of the decline of the fisheries higher up on the tropic level."
To her, that seems short-sighted.
"The risk of doing the wrong thing is so great," she said.

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it.
Linda and I love discovering special places like Forks in the Air in Rangeley -- a casual, comfortable and elegant place. Checking out online reviews of the restaurant before we arrived, I was amused by one that described it as "a gem in the middle of nowhere." That's not how I'd describe Rangeley!
Owner Michael Kupstar first came here at the age of 6 with his dad, who sold boats and sporting goods. He's been coming to Rangeley ever since. His son took his first steps here. Michael has an impressive resume in the restaurant business, from Kentucky to Florida, including management of 1,000 Long John Silver stores and 18-plus years growing Panera from 52 to 1,700 stores.
He has two restaurants in St. Louis, where he lives when he's not in Rangeley. Forks in the Air is a real family project. His son and his son's wife helped design the interior, which is beautiful, including hardwood floors and a tin ceiling. His daughter and her husband handle the social media and Michael's wife manages the finances. Michael and his brother are also chefs and even co-authored a cookbook.
Chef Payson Farrar is a Mainer and a very talented and creative guy, as is sous chef Stone Walter, another Mainer. I'd read one online review by a fellow who loved the braised pork belly appetizer ($11) so much that he also ordered it for dessert. So of course, I started my meal with that. They braise the pork for six hours and it was fantastic, but Linda wouldn't allow me to order it again for dessert.
Our server, Angie, who also is one of the bartenders, was helpful, as was Michael, who loves to roam the restaurant and talk with guests. This is a friendly place. We even had a nice visit with a couple at the next table who were enjoying their honeymoon. I was pleased to see that the restaurant features beers brewed in Farmington by Tumbledown Brewery, one of my favorites.
My entree of pan-seared scallops ($29) was superb, perfectly grilled outside and tender inside, and the barley risotto was good, too -- lots of flavor and a nice texture. With cream, butter, and cheese, well, what's not to like?
Forks in the Air is an unexpected name for a restaurant, so I asked Michael where the name came from. He told us the entertaining story of a friend's grandmother delivering food to the kids table at Thanksgiving. Apparently when the meal was ready to be placed on the table she would exclaim, "Forks in the air!" so there would be room for all the food.
The space was once a hardware store and has been beautifully remodeled. They were able to keep the original hardwood floor. It has been impeccably refinished, and one would never know how much use it has had over the years.
There is a nice bar area with high-top tables for two along one wall, and two comfortable corner booths near the window in the original hardware storefront. They installed a tin punched ceiling similar to one that had been there.
Another room of seating connects to this. Here, the walls are pale green with windows all along one wall. Some tables have a view of the water. The lighting throughout the restaurant is very nice. It is cozy and welcoming with soft music playing in the background. Michael says they were aiming to offer fine dining in a mountain bistro atmosphere.
The menu has soups and salads ($5-$8) and offers small plates as well. Ron at Pleasant Street B&B raved about the mussels and the flatbread small plates, but they had just switched over to a fall menu when we visited.
I ordered the fried green tomato small plate ($9) -- a dish of three tomatoes in a panko and herbed crust arrived with a drizzle of dill aioli. These were so crispy outside, yet creamy and tart inside. They were right up there with the best fried tomatoes I've ever had. I could only eat two, but George polished off the last one after eating his appetizer.
We also had a taste of the spicy sausage and kale soup made with potatoes and a touch of cream. Wow, was that good. I was only going to try a couple of spoonfuls, but I polished it off.
My entree was the pappardelle with organic Maine mushrooms ($19), a dish that Michael had just tried the night before. He loved it, and so did I. The combination of oyster, shiitake and other mushrooms lent a great depth of flavor. Chef Payson makes his own vegetable stock and uses it in the white wine butter sage sauce. The addition of fresh spinach and shaved Parmesan cheese to the al dente pasta made this the most memorable pasta dish I've had in a long time.
The white and dark chocolate bread pudding is famous here. The warm vanilla-scented pudding was perfection. When the chef found out we had ordered the "classic" dessert, he wanted us to try one of the "new" desserts. His creation of pumpkin cheesecake was so light for a cheesecake and the bourbon sour cream topping made this a delight.
Forks in the Air is a real find.

CONVERSATIONS WITH
COASTAL MAINERS
By Charlie Wing
Create Space Independent Publishing, 2016
472 pages, $18.95
A tipsy pundit once quipped: "I drink to make other people more interesting." Well, there is no need for a double martini to appreciate the fascinating lives of the 35 Mainers depicted in Charlie Wing's new book.
"Salt in Their Veins" is a smart collection of interviews of Maine men and women living on the coast, from Cape Elizabeth to Eastport, revealing much about the industrious, creative, pragmatic and funny people who live and work on and near the sea. Charlie Wing is a scientist, professor, PBS host and author of more than 20 books. His earlier books were all about things and how they worked. This, however, is his first book about people, and, as his wife says, it is "his first book with a pulse."
Wing's selections include fishermen, lobstermen, boat builders, tugboat men, merchant mariners, artists, docking and sea pilots, a humorist, an author, even a waitress, oysterman and others. This is sort of a homespun oral history, as folks tell of their lives and why they all have salt in their veins.
Willis Spear, of Cousins Island, tells of lobster fishing with his wife as sternman, "but I didn't dare call her that." Pilot William Gribbin describes piloting large ships in confined waters. Dain Allen, of South Harpswell, offers some salty views of government fishing regulations. And famous solo circumnavigating sailor Dodge Morgan tells how he was kicked out of college for shooting off a cannon in the dean of women's bedroom.
Learn why merchant mariner Tim Holmes worked in Vietnam for the NSA, but thought that meant "National Shipping Agency," why the Humble Farmer thinks his wife is the "Almost Perfect Woman," the real meaning of "squat and sink" and why Bud Darling built his own submarine.
NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS
By Maureen Milliken
S&H Publishing, 2016
313 pages, $16.99
Many people read newspapers to remind themselves there are a lot of folks out there who are worse off than they are. And former hot-shot, big-city reporter Bernie O'Dea knows that bad news sells papers.
Bernie is the owner and editor of the "Peaks Weekly Watcher," the newspaper of rural Redimere in north central Maine. Town meetings seem to be the biggest news in Redimere until a deer hunter finds a human gut pile in the woods. But where is the body?
This is Maureen Milliken's second mystery featuring Bernie O'Dea (following "Cold Hard News"). It is a complex, ambitious novel of cold-blooded murder, small town secrets and destructive gossip. As a newspaper editor herself, Milliken brings a refreshing note of authenticity to her stories, setting the reader up for a compelling tale of mayhem.
While Bernie struggles to put out the paper and make payroll, Police Chief Pete Novotny is stuck with a cold case that has haunted him since he was a homicide detective in Philadelphia. Now, a surprising new face in town and the newly discovered gut pile connect old memories with new clues and the disguised reason for Pete's abrupt departure from Philadelphia.
Bernie and Pete are a not-so-secret romantic item in town, but their jobs and intense personalities often put them at odds with each other. When the dead body is gruesomely found, the murder investigation takes on broader meaning involving numerous townspeople, another murder and Bernie's own brother accused of two killings.
This story is complicated with frequent flashbacks to Pete's old cold case and his new investigation, and the reader will have to pay close attention to every character and detail. Milliken could have shortened and untangled some plotlines, but this is still a good mystery.
Bill Bushnell lives and writes in Harpswell.

Full text:   Bloom producing domoic acid could cause brain damage
An unusual bloom of toxic algae has closed a third of Maine's coastline to clam and mussel harvesting and triggered a widespread shellfish recall.
Last week, the Department of Marine Resources issued a recall; of mussels, clams and quahogs caught in Downeast Maine after samples tested positive for domoic acid, a biotoxin that causes illness, memory loss, brain damage and possibly death in humans.
At the same time, the state banned harvesting for mussels, clams, oysters and carnivorous snails on parts of a wide swath of coastline from Deer Isle to the Canadian border.
This is the first time an algae bloom producing toxic domoic acid has occurred in Maine, although low levels of the toxin have been found in shellfish for decades. Some recent mussels and clams showed domoic acid levels of up to 100 parts per million, five times the level considered unsafe for human consumption.
"A closure for this toxin in Eastern Maine is unprecedented, that is not anything anyone has ever seen," said Darcie Couture, a Brunswick marine scientist and former head of the state's marine biotoxin program.
"No one on this coast is that experienced with a domoic acid event," Couture said. "I don't think it is sinking in how serious this is."
The Department of Marine Resources isn't sure what triggered the bloom, how long it will last, or what other species might be affected. This week it started precautionary testing on quahog, Jonah and rock crabs, urchin, whelk and lobster in the impacted area as a precautionary measure.
"We don't have any science that specifically points to anything," Marine Resources spokesman Jeff Nichols said. "Our focus really is on the public health side of this and we are ensuring the closure is implemented and enforced, so far that has been working."
The recall affected mussels and quahogs harvested and stored around Jonesport and clams harvested from Gouldsboro to Jonesport. About five tons of shellfish, 96 percent of the impacted product, were successfully recalled, Nichols said. The recall affected five Maine companies and contaminated mussels made it to retail stores in Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Utah, the Department of Marine Resources said. Soft-shelled clams were found only in Maine and mahogany quahogs were limited to Massachusetts. There is no way to trace the product that wasn't recovered because it was not sold through retail outlets, Nichols said.
There have been no reported illnesses from the contaminated shellfish, the Department of Marine Resources said.
The recall and closures have been a financial blow to Downeast harvesters and shellfish dealers.
"Anytime there is something in the news about the safety of shellfish, it affects the market," said Albert Carver, who owns A.C. Inc., a shellfish dealer in Beals. He would not specifically say how much product was affected, but the financial impact was "significant." This is the first recall Carver has had in 40 years of doing business.
Dealers and harvesters are used to closures, usually for toxic algae blooms known as red tide that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. But no one is sure what to expect this time around, Carver said.
"Generally we get closed for red tide, the state of Maine is extra good at predicting that," Carver said.
"This is new, it is a different critter, it affects things differently, we don't have any history of it."
Domoic acid is produced by a marine phytoplankton called Pseudo-nitzschia that grows rapidly, or blooms, under the right environmental conditions. Filter feeders like mussels and clams eat the algae and store the toxin. The toxin can work its way into the food network, poisoning other fish, crustaceans, seabirds and marine mammals.
In humans, domoic acid causes Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, or ASP, named for the short-term memory loss it produces. Early symptoms of ASP include vomiting, nausea and diarrhea, but it can progress to severe problems like dizziness, confusion, motor weakness, respiratory problems, coma and even death. An ASP outbreak in Prince Edward Island, Canada, in 1987 killed three people and sickened more than 100.
"It's a serious issue, it requires attention," said Sandra Shumway, a shellfish expert at the University of Connecticut. "If it is showing up in those high numbers I'd be worried, it is a very nasty toxin."
While Maine has little experience with domoic acid, states on the Pacific Coast are familiar with the problem. A bloom last year stretched from central California to Washington and into Alaska. The bloom involved some of the highest domoic acid concentrations ever observed in Monterey Bay and the central Oregon coast, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Northwest fisheries office.
The high readings forced an early closure of razor clam industry in Washington and Oregon last year. Tests in one area; in Washington showed toxin levels of 170 parts per million in clams, more than eight times the level considered unsafe for human consumption. Washington shut down most of its lucrative Dungeness crab fishery; last summer because the crustaceans tested for high toxin levels.
In Maine, the state regularly tests shellfish at 80 monitoring sites and updates its closure maps. Currently, mussels, carnivorous snails and surf clams are closed from Deer Isle to the Canadian border. All other clams are closed from Bar Harbor to the border and European oysters are closed from Deer Isle to Machiasport, Nichols said.
In order to open an area, there need to be two clean shellfish meat samples, less than 20 parts per million, recorded seven days apart.
"There is no set time line for this," said Nichols, the Marine Resources spokesman. "We just continue to rigorously monitor the coast. We don't know how long this is going to last."

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it -- their favorite inns, restaurants, trips, activities, experiences, travel books and websites -- in their own personal style. They offer anecdotes, tips and the details you need. Join them in exploring the great state of Maine.
A sunny September day in the Boothbay Harbor area featured a lengthy visit to the fascinating Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens and a great lunch on the deck at Tug's Pub at Robinson's Wharf in Southport -- all just a few minutes from downtown Boothbay Harbor.
Seals cavorted in the harbor as we enjoyed a tasty lunch, starting with Linda's favorite brew -- Geaghan Brothers' Presque Isle Honey Blonde ale. The menu of seafood dishes is lengthy, as you might expect, but there are lots of other choices from burgers to roast beef and chicken wraps.
My haddock wrap ($12) was broiled haddock, which Linda praised as a healthy choice (not always a goal of mine). With tartar sauce, lettuce, tomato and sweet Spanish onions, it was as tasty as it sounds and large as well. I enjoyed coleslaw on the side.
The deck is full of beautiful white Adirondack chairs, a great place to relax, and I noted several grandparents sitting there while the grandchildren cavorted around the deck, some taking photos. We lingered, enjoying the sunshine and the view, before heading home.
That morning, we'd spent a couple of hours at the Botanical Gardens, a truly amazing place. If you've never been, put it at the top of your to-do list. I love the easy walks through all the sections from the deep woods to the sea, the kid's area to the Lerner Garden of the Five Senses. Everything is well labeled, so the walk is also a learning experience. All those flowers are stunning.
The Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens is a magical place. Whether a gardener or a non-gardener, child or adult, fit hiker or handicapped, there is something here for everyone. The Visitor Center, Education Center and Central Gardens are accessible for people of all abilities. Info about shuttles, wheelchairs and scooters is available at the information desk.
The idea of these gardens was born in 1991 with the first visitors arriving in 2007. It is now a 270-acre treasure filled with woodland gardens, a pond and quite an array of themed gardens. The Bibby and Harold Alfond Children's Garden is a prime example of what makes this place so special. From the spouting whale rock sculptures and Big Leaf and Small Leaf Gardens to the Coloring Cottage and Story Barn to a vegetable garden and maze lawn, this is a space that is sure to capture the young at heart. The details, like miniature clothing hung out on a clothesline and the owl figures carved in the white picket fence, show how much thought has gone into everything. I really enjoy the Garden of the Five Senses, as well.
Throughout the gardens, perennials and annuals are massed in big expanses that lend wonderful splotches of color. On our September visit there were fantastically large flowers in bloom that had me puzzled. It turns out that they were varieties of hibiscus. A sight of white or red blooms larger than dinner plates is sure to grab attention.
There are longer trails that are great walks with lots of seating along the way to soak up the beauty and relax. A lady coming up the Shoreland Trail greeted us with a sigh and said, "It is so peaceful here." I couldn't agree more. If you can't visit soon, take a look online at some of the pictures of the flowers.
"Gardens Aglow" begins in mid-November, offering spectacular lighted displays that continue through December.
We took a drive around the peninsulas of Southport Island, finding our way to Robinson's Wharf with Tug's Pub and a seafood market. It is situated in a picturesque little cove that is quiet and calming. You are happy to relax with a beer while you wait for your order. "We're in no hurry," George said to our server.
Appetizers included fish tacos with fried haddock and oysters on the half shell. There was also a great selection of sandwiches. You can order your haddock fried or broiled, and there are crab rolls or crab melts. Their unique 207 Burger was topped with two and a half ounces of lobster meat.
But it was the promise of Morse's sauerkraut in a Rachel or a Reuben that held my eye. I was told the difference between the two was that a Rachel has coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. So I guess you know which I chose. This Reuben was made with very lean pastrami that wasn't salty. The marbled rye had a great crunch and the sauerkraut, cheese and thousand island dressing were in perfect proportions.
Robinson's Wharf is a very popular place, and now we know why.

Full text:   WE KNOW THE threat of climate disruption to Maine is real in part because we are experiencing early warning signs. The science is also clear that the problems will escalate if we do not act to further reduce carbon pollution.
There are now many important examples of how a warming climate threatens Maine, and here is one that strikes close to home for many Mainers: our changing marine environment could spell serious trouble for commercial fishing and all those who rely on it for a living. Consider the following:
[bullet] The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than 99 percent of world's oceans.
[bullet] Maine's shrimp fishery has been closed for several years now, attributed in part to warmer waters.
[bullet] Lobstermen and other fishermen are bringing up in new species from warming waters with their catch -- presence of new species is not usually a good sign. For example, warming weather contributes to large increases in green crab populations, which ravages Maine clam flats and eelgrass beds.
[bullet] Clams and other shellfish face an existential threat: the same carbon pollution that is warming the globe is making ocean water more acidic and that makes it more and more difficult to build a shell.
These problems affect many Mainers, from commercial fishermen to all the households and businesses that they interact with. Commercial fishing is a $2 billion part of Maine's economy, employing roughly 39,000 people.
We still have time to avoid broad scale impacts, and the solution is very clear: We must reduce the carbon pollution that is warming our land and seas and acidifying our oceans.
Maine has done a lot over the last 15 years to lead on climate and clean energy, but more needs to be done. Gov. Paul LePage recently joined other states in the region in setting a good achievable goal, consistent with science of reducing carbon pollution by 35 percent to 45 percent by 2030.
The question is: What are the most cost-effective ways to reduce this pollution? That's where the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) comes in.
RGGI is the Northeast states' market-based initiative to reduce carbon pollution from power plants, the No. 1 source of carbon pollution across the nation and region. RGGI sets a limit on carbon pollution and lets competition and market forces determine the best way to reduce pollution. Maine is part of RGGI, which has proven to be a great tool for doing our part to cut climate changing pollution, while boosting our economy and jobs and saving money, too.
Studies show that RGGI is one of our most successful climate polices. RGGI has reduced harmful carbon pollution while lowering energy costs and strengthening our overall economy. Since RGGI launched, member states have reduced emissions by 16 percent more than other states and seen 3.6 percent more economic growth. That's something we should be proud of and build on.
One thing that makes RGGI so successful is that Maine uses most of our RGGI-generated funds to invest in energy efficiency improvements for homes and businesses.
Improving energy efficiency is one of the best ways to lower energy costs and pollution. RGGI funding has helped 10,000 homeowners add insulation or improve heating efficiency. RGGI funds have also helped many large facilities reduce energy costs -- from paper mills to hospitals. For some businesses, savings on energy costs have made it possible to weather a recession or keep production in the state.
Another element of RGGI is the agreement between the states to review the program every three years to update and improve it, as needed. That review is happening now and offers important opportunities to make the most of RGGI's success.
Because it is so cost-effective, and helps us lower energy costs, we believe RGGI should be the core part of meeting the region's 2030 carbon pollution reduction target. At each stage, RGGI has proven more successful than expected.
We urge the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to continue to work with other states to set a long-term RGGI carbon cap that would help meet our overall carbon reduction goals and be in line with our rate of progress to date. Since tackling climate change also helps address other challenges Maine faces, such as growing the economy, making energy affordable, and creating jobs for the young people we want and need to inhabit Maine, we can and should find solutions like RGGI that advance multiple goals.
It's good economic policy and the long-term livelihood of our marine economy depends on it.

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it.
The Whitehall is one of the oldest inns in Camden, located on High Street within walking distance of downtown. Two years ago, it was refurbished by Lark Hotels. They kept all the beautiful architectural features of the building and added bright bold colors and modern furniture to update the style of this inn.
I loved the main lobby, a sprawling open space with many sitting areas. The bright artwork and design is well done. I enjoyed the variety of seating, as each piece was different. While savoring my early-morning coffee, I sat in several of the chairs and was pleased to find an ultra-modern one that was extremely comfortable.
Our two-room suite was a large space with a comfortable sitting room and full-size couch, sleek wooden rocker, unique tables and a large flatscreen TV. Gray walls and white trim were the perfect backdrop for the bold colors used in the rooms. Comfort is at the forefront here, with an incredibly cozy mattress and luxurious linens on the king-size bed.
The Pig and Poet is the public restaurant located at the Whitehall. The bar was made of rows of old wood molding of different styles and colors that, along with the lighting, was an eye-catching focal point of the room. Wrought iron pipes ending in filament lights squiggle along the ceiling and are as much artwork as they are lighting.
I began my dinner with the roasted asparagus salad plate ($12). Fresh baby greens were topped with chilled roasted asparagus, pickled mushrooms, citrus-roasted carrots, a deviled egg and dressed with tarragon vinaigrette. It was a nice combination of textures, and you could taste the tarragon as well as a light citrus flavor. It was a great way to begin a summer meal.
The food here is described as "modern American," using local fresh ingredients. The chef's creativity shines as one reads through each selection. George's appetizer of heirloom tomato toast ($12) was a great example, combining avocado, lemon aioli and cucumber with those tomatoes. Yum!
My entree of shrimp and braised pork ($19) was extraordinary. Cheddar grits were the base of this plate, and they were the creamiest grits I'd ever tasted. The well seasoned shrimp were packed with flavor and so tender. Shredded braised pork added a hint of sweetness and made this famous combination shrimp and grits a standout. Thinly sliced watermelon radishes made it all look like a piece of artwork. Not many Maine restaurants offer grits, but when they are cooked well, I think they put the comfort foods of mac and cheese or potato au gratin to shame.
This was a memorable meal, indeed.
I love history, and sitting at the piano where Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Edna St. Vincent Millay was first discovered in 1912 was a real privilege and pleasure. I appreciate the effort that was made to retain the historic features here, while adding modern comforts.
Jessica at the front desk was friendly and welcoming, and we enjoyed visiting with her throughout our stay.
From the beautiful gardens, to the outside seating, to the lawn games, it's all good. While inside, the Pig and Poet offers a real dining adventure.
Let's begin with breakfast. I was surprised when we entered the restaurant at 8 a.m. to find the bar covered with choices, almost all of which were bite-sized, and I appreciated that because it gave me an opportunity to try almost all of them.
My favorite was the tiny eggs with lobster on top. But everything was good, from the yogurt topped with blueberries to the strawberry smoothie. It was a great start to our day.
Dinner here is special, too, from the raw bar with two oyster dishes, to the hand foods -- small meals and plates. When I saw the porcini gnocchi ($24) on the list of plates, it called my name. The dish included locally cultivated mushrooms, English peas, shaved pecorino romano and morel butter creme. The sweet peas and the earthy mushrooms made for a great combination.
We shared dessert, the chocolate pot de creme: a huge dollop of chocolate surrounded by strawberries. I was delighted when Linda was too full to eat more than a couple of scoops. Our server, Merritt, a Camden native and recent college graduate, was terrific, and we can only hope she finds that graphic design job she seeks so she can stay in the area she loves.
After dinner, we sat outside, relaxing in comfortable seats and enjoying a fire. I could almost hear Edna St. Vincent Millay playing the piano.

Maine's top 5 challenges

Publication info: Morning Sentinel ; Waterville, Me. [Waterville, Me]10 Aug 2016: 1.A.

Abstract: MAINE FACES MANY challenges, so I paid attention when I read a news story about a speech to the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce by Sen. Angus King in which he described our five most serious long-term challenges. Typical of Angus, he did see some positive news in climate change, noting that the melting of the polar ice caps has opened up northern international shipping routes, which Maine is positioned to capitalize on.

Full text:   MAINE FACES MANY challenges, so I paid attention when I read a news story about a speech to the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce by Sen. Angus King in which he described our five most serious long-term challenges.
Today I'll share his list with you and add my comments.
The most serious challenge, according to Angus, is our aging and incomplete infrastructure. Angus noted that many sewer treatment plants are now 40 to 50 years old and must be rebuilt, a very costly process.
But he was not just talking about waste. For instance, the much-written-about but little-done-about lack of broadband internet service in much of Maine, particularly in rural Maine, is a huge problem, leaving us out of the major growth in businesses that rely on broadband -- and that's most businesses these days.
Angus used an example of someone who was considering the purchase of a home, but then is told they'd never have broadband. Sort of like telling them it's a great home and community, but they'll never have running water, he said.
And while we're on the subject of water, I'd add the challenges we face with lead or other chemicals in too many water sources. Clean water needs more attention, for sure.
Up next on Angus's list was climate change, which he noted is killing shellfish and moving lobsters further east on the coast.
I've been writing and talking about climate change for quite a while now, and there is some serious work being done on the topic here in Maine. But we're not close to solving this monumental problem, which, I am afraid, we are leaving to our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to deal with. I'm also afraid they won't look on us very kindly for ignoring the problem and failing to resolve it.
Typical of Angus, he did see some positive news in climate change, noting that the melting of the polar ice caps has opened up northern international shipping routes, which Maine is positioned to capitalize on. Yes, Angus, that's true, and I guess those ships will be able to dock on Congress Street in Portland, after Commercial Street is flooded by the rising ocean tides.
I totally agree with Angus's third challenge: lack of diversity in Maine energy sources. He rightly reported that energy costs are not the issue, lack of diversity is the problem.
I've written before that Maine could be energy independent, using wood, wind, water and the sun, but we are far from that goal today. Just think what it could mean for our state, which spends the most on fossil fuels of any state in the country. Angus also thinks that reliance on natural gas would be a mistake, good advice as we ask taxpayers to pay for expanded natural gas lines into Maine.
I've been involved in issues in the northern forest for decades, and Angus raised a concern about the closure of paper mills and the decline in the market for timber.
He rightly focused on making new products with our trees, something the forest industry -- led by the Maine Forest Products Council -- is deeply involved in. My friends at MFPC are optimistic about the future of forest products jobs and the industry, and I sure hope they are right.
This issue reminded me of something Angus said when he was governor: "No fish should leave the state with its head on." Yes, let's process our fish, and our fiber, right here in Maine, and stop exporting so many of our trees.
You may know that the federal government has essentially declared our forest products industry a disaster, and sent a special team to Maine to address the state's forest-based economic challenges. This includes an investment of millions of dollars in rural Maine communities, good news for sure, but a sad recognition of how much trouble we are really in.
The fifth challenge cited by Angus hit close to home with me: the aging workforce and population decline. Angus called this "a negative demographic time bomb."
At 67 years of age, and semi-retired, I look around me and see -- mostly -- a lot of people older than me. Two of our three kids are living out of state, where economic opportunities are so much better.
"How old is Maine?" Angus asked. And answering his own question he noted, "We're so old, our junior senator is 72."
I was pleased to see that Angus agrees with me on another issue. Immigrants are bringing -- and must be allowed to continue to bring -- economic vitality to our state.

Full text:   The Medomak Valley Land Trust's third annual auction fundraiser is set for 5-10 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 13, at Cider Hill Farm on Main Street in Waldoboro.
The event will feature Steelin' Thunder, a steel drum band, to get the night off in Caribbean beat, and the Ale House String Band to finish the evening, as well as a lobster bake and a buffet with jerk chicken and other calypso tastes and will feature both a live and silent auction.
"What's especially exciting this year is the breadth of the donations," Executive Director Daniel Ungier said in a news release from the trust. Waldoboro Shellfish Committee member Glen Melvin will offer a hod of just-dug clams to one lucky bidder, while another local clammer will offer to teach someone how to locate the holes and dig for clams on Sampson Cove. There also will be a freezer-ready 40-pound lamb from a local farmer.
The live auction will include many other items, including a one-week stay in a six-bedroom historic house in Friendship.
Kaja Vielleux, of Thomaston Place Auction Galleries, will run the live auction and has donated an item from his galleries for the event.
Pre-bidding is available online at www.medomakvalley.org.
Tickets cost $75 in advance or $80 at the door. Proceeds will ensure the land trust can continue to steward and preserve land.

Full text:   Officials drop charges against ex-sheriff
MACHIAS -- Prosecutors have dropped felony theft charges against a former Washington County sheriff.
Donnie Smith was accused of misappropriating more than $11,000 from the county's inmate benefit fund by spending it on gifts for deputies, meals and other items that didn't benefit inmates over six years.
The Hancock County District Attorney's office decided Monday to dismiss the case.
It said that after further interviews with witnesses and a review of the policy of how inmate funds should be used, it's unclear that any laws were violated.
District Attorney Toff Toffolon says there's some lack of definition around what does or doesn't benefit inmates.
Smith was sheriff from 2007 to 2014. He is headed to trial in early July on charges in an unrelated case.
Five Mainers assisting in flood-ravaged W.Va.
PORTLAND -- Three American Red Cross volunteers from Maine are joining two others already in West Virginia to help with disaster relief after deadly flooding.
The flooding has killed 23 people in West Virginia over the past week.
Larry French, of Rockland, Ellin Ruffner, of Yarmouth, and Edward Mouw, of Kennebunk, departed from Maine on Monday. They're joining Randy Eldridge, of Orland, and Margaret Rode, of Tenants Harbor.
The Maine volunteers are joining hundreds of disaster workers providing meals, relief supplies and assistance to first responders.
Conference on ocean acidification at USM
PORTLAND -- The University of Southern Maine is hosting a daylong conference about the impact of ocean acidification on the state's coastal waters.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration describes ocean acidification as a change to the chemistry of the ocean over an extended period of time mostly because of uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Some environmentalists refer to it as the "evil twin" of global warming.
Wednesday's conference is scheduled to run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Hannaford Hall in the Abromson Center.
Speakers will include Libby Jewett, director of NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program. There will also be a discussion of the impact of ocean acidification on commercially important marine species such as shellfish.
Organizers say at least 100 researchers, legislators and residents plan to attend.
Idexx Labs founder gives $1M to Acadia
BAR HARBOR -- The founder of Idexx Laboratories is giving $1 million to pay for a science initiative involving Acadia National Park.
David Shaw's money will underwrite programs involving institutions such as the National Park Service, Schoodic Institute at Acadia National Park and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He said the project will allow parks to offer more opportunities for scientific research and education.
Shaw announced the gift at Park Science Day on Saturday. He said the initiative will start with projects at Acadia and expand to other national parks.
Shaw told the Portland Press Herald he believes all parks can benefit from connecting scientists and their research with educators and the public. He lives in Scarborough.

Full text:   SKOWHEGAN -- Cultivated mushrooms, lamb and seafood fresh from the cold water off the coast of Maine are new to the Skowhegan Farmers Market this summer, along with Carrier Tessie, the newly appointed market manager.
Tessier takes over the manager's job this month from longtime market manager Sarah Smith, of Grassland Farm in Skowhegan. Tessier said there are 17 vendors offering everything from fresh bread and cheese to beef, fruits, hard cider, eggs, honey, vegetables, chicken, duck, coffee, tea, seedlings and herbs.
"I'm here to represent the market and reach out to the community," Tessier, of Tessier's Farm in Skowhegan, said Wednesday as she prepared rabbits for market. "This year we have new vendors down there. We now have two mushroom people -- one in Cornville with oyster and shiitake mushrooms, and one from Vassalboro," Tessier said. "They're cultivated; they grow them on logs."
Tessier said the market also has added lobster, scallops and haddock that she said is caught Friday night and delivered to the market for sale Saturday morning.
She said 400 people will shop at the farmers market on a summer Saturday after school gets out and people's own gardens are planted. She said the market also is a place to socialize and meet the people who grow and raise the food sold there.
"All kinds of people come to market -- families, tourists, people from out of state who are opening up their camps, and people from the art school," she said. "It's very important for people in the community to get to know and have a relationship with the farmers and see where the food they eat comes from and who is raising it."
The market, which originally opened in 1997, is open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. every Saturday from May to October in the parking lot of the Somerset Grist Mill in the former county jail, downtown. There is live music and patio furniture outside the Pickup Cafe, which is closed temporarily for renovation.
Tessier, who runs the family farm with her husband, Jason, 40, and daughters Makenzie, 12, and Kelly, 9, said the Skowhegan Market is the third-largest in the state. Tessier has been a vendor at the market for the past seven years.
Tessier said the market will continue to offer its double-dollars program, in which families using the food stamp program get free fruit and vegetable coupons just for shopping at the market.
The market accepts electronic benefit transfer cards, which have replaced the food stamp program.
The market also participates in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- or SNAP -- for income-eligible families. The market also offers the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program and the Maine Harvest Bucks Program, offering bonuses for SNAP shoppers.
The Skowhegan Farmers Market first opened with two vendors behind the Chamber of Commerce building in the municipal parking lot in 1997. In 2007, through a partnership with the new Main Street Skowhegan program, the market moved to the bank-owned parking lot next to the Grange hall on Pleasant Street.
When Amber Lambke and her business partner, Michael Scholz, bought the former Somerset County jail downtown in 2009 to turn it into a grist mill, the farmers market followed and set up in the parking lot, where there was plenty of parking and space for live music and a children's vegetable garden.
Events such as the 5K Lettuce Run road race are planned for this summer, along with children's activities and, this Saturday, a visit from "Firefighter Rick" Caldwell, who will be on hand with a firetruck demonstration.

Full text:   aine sea farmers are taking a page from Japan (again), an industry titan, to test a new method of farming scallops they hope will grow larger mollusks, and grow them faster than current methods do.
The experiment, in which sea scallops are pinned in pairs to vertical ropes suspended in the ocean water, exposes the animal to more water flow. That, in turn, causes them to open and close their shells more often to feed and helps their adductor muscle, the part that Americans eat, grow larger through exercise during the scallops three-year seed-to-harvest cycle. Farmers hope the "ear-hanging" method will allow them to develop their test farms into commercial-scale operations, which are needed to keep up with rising consumer demand.
And they hope that three scallop pinning, drilling and cleaning machines that a Maine-based investor is bringing to the state from Japan will help them rein in the high labor costs of ear hanging, so they can turn a bigger profit.
The state has granted a handful of limited leases to test the potential market, tapping into the small, tight-knit network of farmers who already raise oysters, clams and mussels in leased state waters up and down Maine's 3,500-mile shoreline.
These demonstration projects will help scientists determine which husbandry methods, nutrient mix, hanging heights and water temperature grow the biggest, fastest and healthiest scallop meats, and if it's profitable enough to become a commercial aquaculture fishery.
A bonus? The new method is said to do less damage to the ocean floor.
But the funding agency that is bankrolling the purchase of the $70,000 worth of ear-hanging machinery knows that the business model has to be as sustainable as the scallop fishery.
"That is why we're stepping in here, to take some of the risk out, to see if what works in Japan will work here," said Hugh Cowperthwaite, fisheries project director with Coastal Enterprises Inc., or CEI, an investor that specializes in spurring rural economic growth. "We want to rebuild this industry, because to us it is a sustainable source of good protein for a population that is clamoring for it. But for a start-up business in Maine, a small oyster or mussel farmer, we know the economics have to be there, too."
A decade ago, Maine's scallop fishery was on its death bed, with commercial landings at their lowest in decades and the state enacting rolling closures of fishing zones in hopes of helping the species rebound.
The fishery bottomed out in 2004, yielding just 54,000 pounds of scallop meat, state statistics show. At prices hovering about $4 per pound, Maine fishermen netted just $218,000 from the sea scallop harvest that year.
The fishery had fallen hard and fast from its peak in 1981, when Maine fishermen landed 3.8 million pounds of scallop meat and earned some $15 million. To stabilize the fishery, the state began surveying the stock and closing zones. They also capped licenses.
Fishermen chipped in, too, using methods developed in Japan to collect wild scallop seed, or spat, in mesh bags suspended in the water where young scallops could grow until they were big enough to release into the wild, thus helping to build up the population.
As a result of these efforts, the Maine sea scallop fishery is rebounding. It has grown from 175,116 pounds in 2011 to 452,672 in 2015, according to the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The value of the scallops themselves has grown even faster, from about $1.7 million in 2011, or about $9.98 a pound, to $5.7 million, or $12.70 a pound, in 2015.
Despite higher harvests, though, the supply of fished scallops has been unable to keep up with demand. To fill in the gap, aquaculture advocates have again turned toward Japan. "We see this as an opportunity to add another species to what Maine growers are already offering," said Mark Green, co-owner of the Maine Scallop Company of Portland, which will work with CEI to test out the Japanese ear-hanging machinery. Green is also a professor of natural sciences at Saint Joseph's College in Standish and a licensed Maine oyster farmer.
Growing scallops in the traditional manner, in trays and cages on the ocean floor, takes time, as much as three years to reach legal size, and lots of labor to keep the shells free from what's known in the industry as "biofouling," such as barnacle growth, which can prevent the scallop from fully feeding; and predators, such as starfish, that like a scallop dinner as much as we do.
Because of the risk of toxin buildup within the scallop organs, scallops must also be shucked at sea. Only the toxin-free adductor muscle can come ashore. The rest of the scallop, like the shell and guts, are tossed overboard. Sea farmers would like to find a way to sell whole scallops to restaurants for that freshest sea-to-table dish when wild scallops are out of season, but that would require regulatory changes and expensive testing.
According to the latest Japanese methods, vertically pinned scallops are suspended about 10 feet below the surface of the water yet not too close to the bottom, where predators lurk. Because the water -- and all of its nutrients -- flow freely, the sought-after adductor muscle grows faster than with the less active tray-grown scallops.
Ear hanging is easier on the ocean floor, the primary habitat of the state's cash cow, the lobster, than wild scallop harvesting, which often comes under fire for disturbing that habitat with its near-shore trawling methods that rake the ocean floor.
There is a catch, though: Hanging requires even more labor than the tray method. To anchor the scallops to the line without damaging the meat, plastic pins must be pushed into the vertical lines and through tiny holes drilled into the hinge of the shell. Unlike many other shellfish, scallops can swim away.
Fortunately, various Japanese machines mechanize much of this labor, from machines that sort juvenile scallops by shell size (which guides hole placement) to the hole drilling itself, from pushing pins through the line and pulling them out again to cleaning the shell.
CEI was recently awarded a $134,000 Maine Technology Institute grant to purchase $70,000 worth of line-pinning, ear-drilling and vessel-mounted shell-cleaning machines and to study their effectiveness on a farmed scallop fishery.
The organization is working with Maine Scallop Co., a joint venture of Green and mussel farmer Peter Stocks, to test the custom-made machinery it is ordering on 1,500 lines in Casco Bay over the next two years.
For example, a team of five people would need about 2.5 hours to drill holes in 300 scallops, Stocks said, while the machine, which can drill two scallop hinges per second, can pierce that same amount in fewer than two minutes, Stocks said.
"It's the equivalent of going from tilling the soil by hand to tilling soil with a tractor," Stocks said.
That is the speed and efficiency required to work a farm of several hundred thousand scallops, he said. He and his crew, and even his wife, have pierced their test lines by hand, but that has essentially capped their production scale at about 10,000 scallops.
"That's not going to grow enough scallops, and generate enough gross revenue, to pay wages for our staff, our insurance and our licensing fees," Stocks said. "But the Japanese have been amazingly good at creating efficiencies needed to succeed in the market."
If Maine Scallop Co. demonstrates rapid, healthy shellfish growth and profitable returns using the Japanese machines, CEI will explore the concept of a machine-sharing agreement with other shellfish farms, Cowperthwaite said. Neither CEI, the state, Maine Sea Grant nor the farmers know what to expect, or if they will have the answers they need to evaluate the viability of the ear-hanging technique and the effectiveness of the machinery here in Maine, under a different government and a different economic regulatory structure.
Cowperthwaite has been spreading the gospel of ear-hanging scallop farming ever since he visited Aomori, Japan, in 2010 as part of a commercial fishing tour of Maine's sister state. This area, which has a climate similar to Maine's, is heavily dependent on fishing.
The state established a sister relationship with the northern prefecture in 1994, but Maine has had ties to the area dating back to the wreck of the Cheseborough, a Bath-built ship that fell victim to a typhoon off its coast in 1889. Of the 19-man crew, only four survived, but they forged a strong bond with locals that remains today, some 125 years later.
That relationship has led to exchanges of students and technology, including the visit that got Cowperthwaite hooked on ear-hanging scallop farms. This fall, he will lead a tour of Maine sea farmers to explore all facets of the Aomori ear-hanging scallop industry.
Dana Morse, an aquaculture researcher at Maine Sea Grant, visited Aomori back in 1999, and came back with the belief that scallop aquaculture would offer the state fishing industry much needed economic and species diversification. Morse is now studying growth rates, biotoxin accumulation rates, biofouling, and yield and market value of ear-hung scallops at several state-sanctioned lease sites around Maine, including near the Darling Marine Center on the Damariscotta River.
"Since early March of this year we are already seeing very strong growth rates with scallops," Morse said. "We're very optimistic."
Damariscotta is the heart of the state's shellfish aquaculture industry, where mussels, oysters, and even smaller-scale fisheries, such as clams and urchins, are cultivated in state-leased waters. Of Maine's 110 commercial aquaculture leases, 28 can grow scallops.
But according to Cowperthwaite, only a handful actually do so. He views that as a missed opportunity to grow the state's aquaculture industry and add jobs, but also to diversify a major state industry that mostly rests on a single species.
"Sea farmers and fishermen are looking for ways to diversify their income and continue to work on the water," he said. "It's no secret that Maine's wild-caught fisheries continue to decline and as an industry we are very dependent on the lobster."
Green, at least, has been quick to see the potential.
"If the (ear-hanging) project goes as planned, scallops will offer a new way to diversify and firm up the economics of my business," he said.
Stocks noted that 90 percent of the seafood consumed in the United States is now imported.
"People who live on the Maine coast need to understand the value of aquaculture," Stocks said. "Scallops clean water. Farming them doesn't disturb the ocean floor. They are a clean, healthy, nutritious, highly regulated food source. We need them, not just for jobs, but for food."

Full text:   It doesn't take a crystal ball to see one possible future for the Maine lobster industry. All it takes is to look south.
Warming water temperature, the result of man-made climate change, has for decades been the primary factor in pushing the lobster population farther and farther north, first decimating the industry off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut, then off Cape Cod.
And even though the industry has been booming in Maine, with record landings the last three years, the focal point of the catch has changed through the years, from Casco Bay to Penobscot Bay and, now, Down East, a signal of its vulnerability to change.
One of the state's iconic industries, indispensable to and inseparable from so many communities, is being disrupted. The question is, how far will it go?
Fortunately, regulators are watching.
The Maine Department of Marine Resources will soon award contracts for studies into not only the full economic impact of the lobster industry, for which there is surprisingly little data, but also on the impact of warming ocean temperatures on lobster biology and the ocean ecosystem in the Gulf of Maine.
The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission lobster management board has also voted to study lobster stocks in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank.
The latter study is meant to avoid the kind of collapse that occurred in southern New England, where there are only an estimated 10 million adult lobsters, one-fifth of the population total from its peak.
As a result of that collapse, the commission has adopted new measures for that region to be phased in by June 2019, among them closed seasons, closed areas, trapping cutbacks and changes to minimum and maximum sizes.
That could be the future for the Gulf of Maine. In some ways, it's already here.
The record landings -- $495 million in 2015, more than four times the catch of 20 years ago -- have come despite no growth in lobster population in southern Maine, once the center of lobstering in Maine. The haulings off York County have actually shrunk, mirroring the changes off Cape Cod and farther south.
That is in large part attributable to the warmer and more acidic waters in the Gulf of Maine, which since 2004 has been warming faster than anywhere on Earth with the exception of an area northeast of Japan.
The warming water helped kill the population of cod -- formerly the fishery's kingpin -- and acidic water is particularly bad for shellfish. The effect on mussels, oysters and clams is already apparent.
It's not hard to see trouble ahead for the lobster.
"We're definitely seeing this geographic shift and it's in keeping with the warming of the gulf," said Robert Steneck, of the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center. "Unless something changes in terms of ocean temperature trends, the Gulf of Maine will not likely remain a great place for high lobster abundance. How long this takes to play out, whether it's decades or centuries, nobody knows."
Maine cannot by itself do much to reduce the greenhouse gases that cause climate change, though even considering those limitations, state government has not done enough to address and ready for warming.
At the very least, state officials should implement the findings of a commission that studied ocean acidification, and Maine should hold up the gulf as an example to the rest of the country of what warming will bring, as we wait for the next round of studies to reinforce just how dire the situation is.
There should be little doubt that changes in climate have the potential to disrupt the lobster industry the way changing markets have harmed Maine paper mills, with similar devastating results for the communities that rely on it. We have to be prepared.

Full text:   Rebecca Charles planning to open 25-seat oyster bar called Spat Oyster Cellar
Rebecca Charles, chef/owner of Pearl Oyster Bar in New York City, has purchased the former Abbondante Trattoria & Bar in Kennebunk, fulfilling a longstanding dream of owning a restaurant in Maine.
Abbodante, an Italian restaurant located at 27 Western Ave. in the Lower Village, had been run by chef David Ross and his wife, restaurateur Merrilee Paul, in partnership with the Kennebunkport Resort Collection since May 2013. Ross and Paul closed the place last fall to focus on their other businesses, 50 Local and Owen's Farmhouse.
Charles plans to open a 25-seat oyster bar called Spat Oyster Cellar in the downstairs part of the building, where there's a small dining room with a fireplace and stone patio, in July. The large dining room upstairs will open sometime in the fall.
Charles, reached in New York on Tuesday, said she is also building a home in Maine and plans to move here over Memorial Day weekend. She'll spend the whole summer in Maine, then once the new restaurant opens she'll split her time between Maine and New York City.
Charles, whose small restaurant in Greenwich Village brought the love of the lobster roll to New York City, has long ties to Maine -- her family has summered in Kennebunk since 1917 -- and visits here often. In the 1980s, Charles worked as a chef at the Whistling Oyster in Ogunquit and at Cafe 74 and the White Barn Inn in Kennebunk, where she was executive chef. Even after moving back to New York in 1987, she visited often with family summering in Maine.
Charles said she's wanted to open a restaurant in Maine since 1997, the same year she founded Pearl Oyster Bar, and she's been trying to buy the Abbondante building for four years. She reminisced about her time hanging out there in the 1980s, when the restaurant was called Grissini and had "a lovely feel." Now she owns it herself, which she says "feels weird" after putting in many bids over the years and always being turned down.
"I wanted this to happen when I was in my 50s," she said. "I'm now 62 and opening another restaurant. But it's been such a longstanding goal, I knew if I didn't take advantage of the opportunity, I'd regret it for the rest of my life."
Charles said she may call the new place Pearl, but more likely it will be Pearl North. "It will have the trappings of the Pearl Oyster Bar menu, with a lot of the same dishes," she said.
But Pearl Oyster Bar is "a very small restaurant" with a limited menu, and it serves only beer and wine. The Maine version of Pearl will have a total of 150 seats, so Charles won't be sticking strictly to her menu of elevated seafood -- she'll also serve meat, poultry and pasta, and will have a full bar.
"I'm very happy to be getting back to cooking meat because I never saw myself as a seafood cook," Charles said.
Charles has already hired two sous chefs who will run the restaurant when she's in New York. Richard "Ricky" Penatzer has worked at Fore Street, Grace and the Portland Hunt & Alpine Club, in addition to Pearl Oyster Bar, Charles said. Jonathan Bagley previously worked at Pier 77 and Pedro's Mexican Restaurant in Kennebunkport.
Spat Oyster Cellar (spat is the term used for baby oysters) will likely be open year-round.
Charles said she doesn't think the food scene in the Kennebunk region "has ever really gotten what it deserves," and she's looking forward to contributing to it herself.
She promises: "I won't blow it."

Full text:   IT STARTED WITH Atlantic salmon hatcheries in the late 1800s, and today aquaculture is one of Maine's best stories, growing rapidly and helping us transition from an economy dependent on wild fish to one that grows those fish and other ocean products in pens.
If you've ever enjoyed mussels grown on those farms in the Damariscotta River, your mouth may be watering now like mine is. Those farms have recently added seaweed to their crops, something that has taken off as a food additive.
A lot of our farms were started by young people, what Sebastian Belle calls the "Blue Revolution," kids eager to spend their lives outdoors, where they started with oysters. Today Maine has more than 60 oyster farms.
I sat with Sebastian, the executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, for nearly two hours recently as he told me fascinating stories about this amazing industry. Sebastian worked in the aquaculture industry in Norway for 10 years, grew salmon in Maine, and has spent his career working in all aspects of aquaculture, giving him a great understanding of the industry he now represents.
I have one aquaculture story of my own. One year, the federal government ordered Maine's aquaculture industry to rid itself of the Atlantic salmon it was growing, fearing they would escape and breed with the wild salmon the feds have been working -- unsuccessfully -- to restore to Maine's rivers for decades.
Initially the salmon were going to be killed and buried in a landfill. But then I got an invitation to fish for them, in the pens, and it didn't take long to say yes.
I took several trips to the pens, with friends, standing on the outer rim of the pens and fishing for those salmon. Well, it wasn't really fishing, it was catching. I can't even begin to explain the excitement of seeing a 35-pound salmon rising up out of the depths of the pen to grab my lure.
Some of my friends made fun of this until I took them along, and then they begged to return. I brought home coolers full of salmon and shared the fillets with family, friends and neighbors. And later, the remaining salmon were given to our Native Americans, so none was wasted. The company even hosted a few paying guests, anglers who traveled here from out of state, spent lots of money, and enjoyed catching those fish.
Today, a different strain of salmon, provided by the government, is being grown in vastly improved pens, with lots of scrutiny to assure they don't escape. It took three years of hard work to revive the salmon industry, with leadership from folks including Des FitzGerald of Duck Trap Farms as well as our environmental organizations, a "good example of how to work together," notes Sebastian.
There are many good stories about enterprising folks who built this successful industry in Maine. Glenn Cooke, of Cooke Aquaculture, would be one. He started with a single cage and now is one of the largest aquaculture businesses in the world. His family, which reaches into New Brunswick, "took a leap of faith," says Sebastian, buying leases and a processing plant in Machiasport. "They deserve great credit," he said.
I was particularly fascinated by the new management system they've created, called "all in, all out." They stock all their salmon pens one year, harvest the fish in two years, and leave the pens empty the year after, which reduces the ability of pathogens to attack the fishery.
Glenn's beautiful salmon run 10 to 12 pounds and he's started branding them as "Maine salmon," which allows him to charge a higher price. When he raised the price for his "Maine salmon," sales actually increased.
At Hannaford, the price for his salmon went up $3 per pound, while his competitors lowered their price by $1 per pound, and still his sales increased. "We have a brand that works," said Sebastian.
Maine mussels and oysters now claim a price 20 percent higher than anyone else's. Our cold, clean water and longer shelf life delivers higher-quality products, and people are willing to pay for that.
One of the best parts of this story is how Maine commercial fishermen and their kids who couldn't get commercial fishing permits started farming their ocean products with great success. Everything is going in the right direction for us, including the "foodie" movement and development of new products, especially in seaweed. We now have seven farms growing seaweed.
Ocean Approved in Portland is supplying dried seaweed to health food stores and created a kelp pasta that is gluten free. Coming soon: a kelp cube for milkshakes and smoothies. "Kelp is the new kale," Sebastian told me.
Now, aren't you hungry?

Abstract: Town officials plan to spray pesticide along a three-mile stretch of Foreside Road within the next few weeks to kill browntail moth caterpillars just as they come out of their winter cocoons and begin to feed on new leaves. An aerial survey of infested areas last autumn showed serious defoliation in trees that were starting to shed their leaves, caused by tiny caterpillars before they nest for the winter, Donahue said.

Full text:   CUMBERLAND -- Town officials in Cumberland are planning to spray pesticides to slow down an infestation of browntail moths that is expected to cause skin rashes and respiratory problems in more than a dozen communities this summer.
Town officials plan to spray pesticide along a three-mile stretch of Foreside Road within the next few weeks to kill browntail moth caterpillars just as they come out of their winter cocoons and begin to feed on new leaves.
The invasive species can cause skin rashes and respiratory issues in humans and defoliate native hardwood trees. A state scientist warns the caterpillars are more abundant now than they have been in a decade. Cumberland officials hope that confronting the moths now could limit the impacts by preventing the infestation from spreading further into town.
"It's almost like a fire line if you will, to keep them from marching inland," said Town Manager William Shane.
For the spraying to be effective, however, the town needs Foreside homeowners to allow its contractor to spray onto their properties. Most residents appear to be on board with the program, although some people are uncomfortable with using a pesticide treatment, officials said.
"I am not 100 percent for spraying, but when it comes to this, there is no alternative," said Tom Gruber, a town councilor who has lived on Foreside Road for more than 30 years.
"The more residents that opt in for spraying, the more likely the chances are that we can stop this invasion," Gruber said.
Cumberland is the only community planning to address the issue with pesticides, although it is only one of more than a dozen towns and cities that are at risk of moths this year, according to the Maine Forest Service.
Coastal communities north and south of Portland and as far east as Boothbay are at moderate risk of moths. The epicenter of high risk is the area between Freeport, Harpswell, Woolwich and Bowdoinham. Although moths have typically been a coastal problem, the population during this outbreak stretches as far inland as Turner, Waterville and Winslow.
Browntail moths were introduced to the U.S. more than 150 years ago and are located only in coastal southern Maine and on Cape Cod. The population usually stays at a low enough level that it isn't a problem, but periodic infestations can last for years and spread far from coastal areas, said Charlene Donahue, an entomologist with the Maine Forest Service.
The reason for population surges is poorly understood because there is no good scientific research on the moths. But visual surveys of winter webs in the past two years suggest that this current infestation is the worst in more than a decade, Donahue said.
Moth caterpillars nest by the hundreds in winter webs, clusters that look like bunches of dead leaves often located in Oak and Apple trees. Seriously affected areas can have tens of thousands of webs. An aerial survey of infested areas last autumn showed serious defoliation in trees that were starting to shed their leaves, caused by tiny caterpillars before they nest for the winter, Donahue said.
"I was shocked to see how much damage there was in the fall," Donahue said. "We haven't seen that kind of damage in 15 years or so."
Browntail moths harm trees, but the leading concern is the health effects they have on humans.
Browntail caterpillars are covered in microscopic poisonous hairs that cause a severe rash similar to poison ivy and can lead to respiratory problems for some people. Caterpillars will shed the poisonous skin five times over the spring, and the hairs drift around and can get on exposed skin and even saturate clothing drying outside. The toxins in the hairs take up to three years to break down, which means they stay in the environment and affect people months after caterpillars are gone, Donahue said.
"Just being in the area can give you a rash," Donahue said.
The outbreak 15 years ago was so severe that some coastal communities coordinated a regional aerial pesticide spray to cut back the insect population. That program became controversial, partially because of concern that widespread use of pesticide could harm lobsters and other shellfish. The infestation was finally tempered by several years of wet, cool springs that produced a tree fungus that decimated the moth population. Without a similar fungus, the infestation could continue for years, Donahue said.
Targeted pesticide spraying such as the effort in Cumberland can limit moths locally, but won't have an impact on the broader problem, Donahue said.
"Realistically, what this mostly will provide is relief from the rash. It is doubtful it will really suppress the population," she said.
Cumberland plans to use truck-mounted sprays to treat areas between 250 and 500 feet in from Foreside Road. Terry Traver, a licensed pesticide applicator with Whitney Tree Service, said the chemical his company uses, Tempo, is approved by the state, but he appreciates that some people may be uncomfortable with spraying an area with chemicals. Whitney is the company the town is contracting with to spray.
"We're just trying to suppress it in some of the public areas," he said.

Toxic chemicals all around us

Full text:   THE RECENT STORY on a proposal to limit the use of synthetic pesticides in South Portland ("Plan to ban pesticides: A model or a mistake?", April 11) offers an overview of the differing perspectives on proposed pesticide ordinances. It also raises the significant issue of how both federal and state agencies are not doing enough to ensure that commonly used lawn and garden products are safe.
But this is just one part of a larger and much more ominous problem: the failure over decades of state and federal government to protect citizens from the short- and long-term risks of exposure to literally thousands of hazardous chemicals all around us.
Toxicity to children (and, to a greater extent, dogs) from lawn and garden pesticides is just one aspect of the danger. Tons of widely used chemicals such as glyphosate, the active ingredient in the weedkiller Roundup and nitrogen-rich fertilizers eventually reach Casco Bay, contributing to overgrowth of green algae and mass die-offs of phytoplankton, which can adversely affect fish and shellfish. Growing public concern surrounds the use of neonicitinoid pesticides, which are closely linked with declining numbers of bees and other pollinating insects, bats and other species further up the food chain.
The 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act, a federal law conceded to have been largely shaped by the chemical industry, has been a toothless, sleeping watchdog. During the past 40 years, it is estimated that over 80,000 synthetic chemicals have entered into widespread use in industry, household products, personal care items and myriad other uses; newer chemicals are being added at an estimated rate of over 700 per year. Only a small fraction have been adequately tested and even fewer are adequately targeted by meaningful restrictions or outright bans on their use.
Alarmingly, widespread testing of umbilical cord blood reveals that is possible to detect over 200 synthetically produced chemicals and their breakdown products. In adults, evidence of these same chemicals can also be found in blood, urine, semen and other body fluids.
A wide spectrum of problems are correlated with exposure to synthesized chemical toxins, as well as to many other substances long recognized as harmful, such as lead, mercury, arsenic, dioxin and radon. Many public health experts attribute the rising incidence of various cancers, infertility, birth defects, lowered IQ, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and behavior and learning problems to increasing exposure to the toxins that are everywhere in our environment.
Children are more vulnerable to any type of poisoning than are adults, because of their higher metabolism and respiratory rate, greater surface-to-mass ratio and the tendency for toddlers to crawl across lawns and floors, mouthing whatever they think looks interesting. There are also critical periods in utero and during early childhood when their developing nervous systems are more vulnerable to disruptive influences.
Moreover, their longer lifespan means children may continue to accumulate toxic chemicals in their bodies far longer than adults. The presence of even small amounts of endocrine-disrupting chemicals at critical periods of embryonic development may contribute to birth defects in male genitals, and possibly later infertility or other reproductive problems. Such long-term adverse effects escape detection during short-term testing.
Research has shown a clear connection between exposure to some of these hormone-mimicking chemicals and marked obesity in rats raised on the same diet as matched controls, suggesting that environmental toxins - as well as more obvious factors such as overeating and inactivity -- may be insidious contributors to the current national epidemic of obesity.
Bills intended to replace the Toxic Substances Control Act have been put forward in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, with conference committees now working to integrate these into a meaningful bipartisan consensus. Inevitably, chemical industry lobbyists will be attempting to weaken or dilute any final version. It is thus a crucial time for our congressional delegation to hear from Maine citizens and environmental groups seeking stronger protective action.
When writing or calling the offices of our senators and representatives, urge their support for provisions in any new chemical legislation that will:
[bullet] Compel the Environmental Protection Agency to identify and test significant numbers of "chemicals of high concern" (chemicals proven to cause serious health concerns) within a specific time frame.
[bullet] Ensure that the language of any new legislation does not effectively invalidate safeguards already in place in Maine and other states with progressive toxic control laws (such as the Kid-Safe Product Act, banning bisphenol-A in child products).

Full text:   THE TRAVELIN' MAINE(RS), George and Linda Smith, of Mount Vernon, have spent their lifetimes enjoying all that Maine has to offer. Now they tell you about it in their own personal style.
Whenever someone wants to meet with me in the Portland area, I insist on getting together in my "Portland office," a corner booth by the window at Hot Suppa! on the west end of Congress Street. So of course, when Linda and I decided to start this Let's Do Lunch series, Hot Suppa! was at the top of our list for a visit.
The small, cozy dining area is inviting with a small bar, booths along one wall and three larger tables along the picture windows looking out on the street. A huge chalk board on the back wall lists the day's specials and brews -- always with a good choice of Maine microbrews.
For lunch I enjoyed an Oxbow Farmhouse Ale while Linda had an Allagash White. We'd spent the morning at the Maine Restaurant Association's Expo, where food tempted us at many booths. OK, tempted me. But Linda insisted we not eat anything there, so I only got a few nibbles when she wasn't looking.
That was actually a good thing, because portions at Hot Suppa! are large. We started with a side order of fried green tomatoes, a favorite anytime we are here.
The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch items all day until dinner when a very creative menu takes over for the evening. My favorite lunch items are the BLT and Cubano, and Lin ordered the BLT on this visit, making my choice easy. The Cubano is a Cuban-style pork and ham sandwich with gruyere, brown mustard and cornichion pickles on a toasted French bread ($11). Yummy doesn't begin to describe it.
Our server, Rebecca, has been here a long time and is both friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and all things Portland. Both Mo Sabina, the chef, and his brother Alec, the manager, have become friends of ours and spent quite a bit of time visiting with us that day. They grew up in Gorham and are hard workers. It's great to see them succeed and prosper.
Alec's significant other, Angela Ferrari, a Farmington native, has filled the walls with her stunning works of art, all for sale at reasonable prices. It's a real pleasure to enjoy that art during your meal. I've had lunch with lots of people here, and they all became regular customers. You should, too.
The first time I tasted Hot Suppa!'s fried green tomatoes I fell in love. They are double battered before being fried, and the batter is well-seasoned. Once cooked, the crusty outside combines perfectly with the soft, tangy tomato inside. Their addictive remoulade of mayonnaise, capers, cilantro and a dash of hot sauce (with some other spice I can't quite figure out) has me craving these often.
George has finally understood that when he goes to Portland and has lunch there, he is to bring home an order of fried green tomatoes for me. When I go there for lunch, I lean toward the Fried Green Tomato BLT.
The southern cooking influence really shows up on the dinner menu -- from chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits to oysters and pork belly with red beans and rice. Mo went to school in the South and fell in love with the food. Now he serves it right here in Maine.

It was a very long winter for me. Mount Vernon's cafe was closed in January and February for renovations. No place to go for those great breakfasts. No place to hang out with friends and neighbors. No place for lunch. I was so happy when they reopened.
While it is true that I have been known to have breakfast here and still be at the cafe when lunchtime rolls around, I am more apt to come for lunch. And if anyone wants to meet with me in this area, I insist on doing that at the cafe.
Chef/owner Sarah Chaisson is a great cook, and after I had one particular sandwich about a hundred times, she named it after me, calling it the Gorgeous George. But to be humble, I asked her to change that to the George. It's a pulled-pork sandwich in a wrap, and it is so good. Even if it isn't on the menu, they can usually make it for me.
Haddock chowder on Fridays is another favorite. Linger at a window seat and enjoy the view of the lake, or sit on the porch in summertime and watch the fast-moving stream rushing by just beyond the screen. I love the art here, which rotates every month. The staff is wonderful and so are the customers. Be ready to say "hi" and visit with us.
My favorite sandwich at The Post Office Cafe keeps calling my name. It is the Californian, a panini of turkey, avocado, red onions, cheese and mayonnaise. The soups here are always good, and then there is the cilantro coleslaw. Everything here is fresh and delicious. It's a great cafe and draws customers from all over Maine.

Abstract: Seeking out sustainability in the senior years may not yet be the huge trend implied by a New York Times article last year, but the people who run retirement communities here in Maine -- and the people who live in them -- say that amenities such as solar power, energy-efficient homes and composting are factors that are becoming more important when baby boomers draw up a shopping list for a retirement home. The 2016 Best of 55+ Awards competition, sponsored by the National Association of Home Builders, gave the Gold award for Best Integration of Nature & Landscape to the Senior Residences at Forrest Hills, Decatur, Georgia.

Full text:   ALMOUTH -- When Bill and Margot Gatchell come in from sea kayaking, they warm up in a home that's heated by 14 solar panels.
When they want to swim laps, they dive into a pool that's also heated by the sun.
And when they dine out at their local bistro on a Friday night, they choose from a menu of local foods that includes Maine crabcakes and Pineland Farm filet mignon.
All of these environmentally friendly choices come courtesy of their new home, the retirement community OceanView at Falmouth. The Gatchells are among a growing number of retirees who are making their golden years "greener" by moving into communities that pay attention to things like energy efficiency, access to nature and local foods.
Seeking out sustainability in the senior years may not yet be the huge trend implied by a New York Times article last year, but the people who run retirement communities here in Maine -- and the people who live in them -- say that amenities such as solar power, energy-efficient homes and composting are factors that are becoming more important when baby boomers draw up a shopping list for a retirement home.
"The importance of those things is starting to creep up the list. I wouldn't say it's the top three -- yet," said Brian Storey, executive director of The Highlands in Topsham, a traditional retirement community where the residents' Go Green Committee has gotten involved in everything from recycling to the responsible disposal of medications. A 2014 consumer research survey conducted by the National Association of Home Builders found that hiking and biking trails are the most popular outdoor amenities in the 55-plus age group. That survey did not ask about solar power, but respondents did want energy-efficient windows and appliances in their homes.
In Maine, there are still only a handful of green retirement communities. Nationally, no one appears to be keeping hard data on their numbers, but when they pop up they do get attention and awards. The Orchards at Southington in Southington, Connecticut, won Argentum's "Going Green" Award in 2013 for efforts ranging from recycling to tree planting. The 2016 Best of 55+ Awards competition, sponsored by the National Association of Home Builders, gave the Gold award for Best Integration of Nature & Landscape to the Senior Residences at Forrest Hills, Decatur, Georgia. Wake Robin in Shelburne, Vermont, offers a recycling program, a community garden and nature trails. Other such green communities can be found in Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Washington.
"Moving forward, in the next 20 years, these green communities will become the standard," Andrew Carle, director of the senior housing administration program at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, told The New York Times.
The newest community for green retirees in Maine may be The Cottages at Willett Brook, a 55-plus energy-efficient community in Bridgton, but it isn't the first.
John Wasileski, of Sea Coast Management Co., is behind many of the environmentally conscious retirement communities in Maine: OceanView (which dates back to the 1980s), The Highlands (which was sold last year to an investment group) and Highland Green, a 55-plus community of 190 homes, also in Topsham.
Highland Green incorporates both a 230-acre nature preserve and a nine-hole golf course that has been certified by the Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary Program for Golf. Count Lynda and Steve Chandler, former schoolteachers from Bethel who now own a home in Highland Green, among those to whom those trails appealed.
"We really wanted a place that had some good land near it for walking and hiking and doing that sort of thing," Steve Chandler said.
The Gatchells are typical residents of OceanView, which may be the most environmentally friendly retirement community in Maine. The couple have been active outdoors people and attuned to environmental issues all their lives. They lived in a passive solar, "super-insulated" house in Cape Elizabeth before moving into OceanView in December. Though environmental concerns weren't their primary reason for choosing the place, they say, still they appreciate that their new home came with 10 solar panels, with the option of adding more. They added four more, and they also installed solar hot water.
"It's all hooked up to the grid," Gatchell said. "If we make more electricity than we can use, it goes into the grid. And if we make enough, we get credit for it."
The couple also appreciates the other environmentally friendly programs OceanView offers. When the staff comes into their home for a free monthly cleaning, they use only green products. A food waste and recycling program turns fryer oil into biodiesel and soaps. All disposable products in the kitchens are made from recyclable or compostable materials. And a pilot composting program that last year composted more than 14,000 pounds of material in the community's dementia residence will be expanded to the rest of the campus this spring, according to Steve Brustein, general manager for food services. When that happens, he expects to triple the amount of composted material.
In its kitchens, OceanView tries to buy local ingredients, especially in its Whipple Farm dining room, which last week hosted an "Earth Day dinner." Lobster comes from a local lobsterman; seafood is also sourced from Harbor Fish Market and Maine Shellfish; the chef works with Maine Native Produce to source local vegetables and fruits.
Lots of construction materials are recycled: When older buildings at Oceanview are renovated, the doors, vinyl windows, cabinetry, appliances and laminate countertops that are still usable are donated to Habitat for Humanity.
Environmental amenities are now often included among the marketing strategies for retirement communities. Highland Green, for example, pitches itself as "a 635-acre oasis of natural beauty and community with an unprecedented incorporation of conservation." These options resonate with potential residents for a variety of reasons. Some want energy-efficient homes in order to save money. Others use such environmental efforts as a way to be community-minded.
"If you present people with 'What are the top 10 things you could do together as a community?'" Storey, of The Highlands, said, "environmental awareness is coming in at the top of that."
The Highlands, among other environmental efforts, composts 144,000 pounds of food waste and other biodegradable materials a year, recycles 7 tons of cooking oil annually, and uses only organic products in its groundskeeping. Half the toilets in the community are low-flow. The residents' Go Green Committee helped the community achieve the points it needed to gain certification as an "environmental leader" from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
Wasileski, who studied environmental science in college, built OceanView in the 1980s and has been ratcheting up the environmental amenities ever since, particularly in the area of energy efficiency. He has been working with solar energy for decades, taking advantage of state and federal incentives when they were available. Asked if OceanView's solar projects were the result of his own interest in environmental issues, good business or a marketing tool aimed at the boomer crowd, he replied: "I'd say 80 percent, 10 percent and 10 percent. I did solar way back in the '70s."
Over the past decade, OceanView has become more aggressive in installing solar systems. Thanks to a series of energy audits, it also cites homes for best solar exposure, insulates well, and installs triple-pane windows and energy-efficient doors.
"We try to incorporate a solar component into every new construction project, and we try to optimize energy efficiency in our construction techniques and architectural design in our new buildings," said Chris Wasileski, John Wasileski's son and project manager for Sea Coast Management Co. "We feel like customers have really driven this." Both current residents and future prospects ask about energy savings and sustainability, he said, partly because of concerns about the cost of heating through cold Maine winters.
The rooftop solar arrays on OceanView residences and facilities remove an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere each year, according to the Wasileskis. Gatchell says he enjoys walking through the buildings on the OceanView campus and looking at the display panels that show how much solar energy the community is producing. He has got such a display in his own home that shows that his own solar panels have generated 0.719 megawatt-hours of electricity since he moved in.
All told, there are 40 different solar power systems at OceanView, and another 20 in Highland Green at Topsham, John Wasileski said. In May, he'll be installing a community solar farm at Highland Green. If the project goes well, he'll be building more. Chris Wasileski predicts the interest in energy-efficient retirement communities will grow as building technologies continue to advance and solar systems become more affordable. At Highland Green, solar energy packages and other environmental options are offered a la carte.
Just five years ago, 15 to 20 percent of new residents chose to add solar to their homes, he said. Today, half the residents go solar.
Combine eco-consciousness with something else boomers like -- intergenerational housing -- and you have Belfast Cohousing & Ecovillage, situated on 42 acres of farmland.
About 70 people live in this 36-home community, and one-third to one-half of the adults are 55 or older, according to Sarah Lozanova, a spokeswoman for the community. "There has consistently been a strong interest in our community from this demographic," she said.
Environmental awareness is, of course, just one reason among many that older adults are attracted to the community.
For Steven Chiasson and his wife, Barbara, both in their 60s, moving to the energy-efficient ecovillage was more a matter of dollars and cents than a desire to be green, "although I certainly count myself among those people who want to do the right thing by the planet," Steven Chiasson said.
The couple lived in Wellington, a little north of Skowhegan, for more than 30 years in a drafty log home Chiasson built himself, a home that cost a lot to heat. In Belfast, their 900-square-foot home has rooftop solar panels and is designed to be a net-zero consumer of electricity. Now their average bill for lights, heat, cooking and hot water is about $25 per month, Chiasson said, and they have grown to appreciate the comfort factor. It's "an easy place to be for aging bones."
John Wasileski, 63, never lived in a log home, but counts himself among the baby boomer crowd who remember the first Earth Day back in 1970. As the boomers got older, though, many forgot those values, transitioning into corporate America and riding around in SUVs.
"But now we see that climate change is a reality," he said. "Now we see that we need to make changes. Now we're seeing our kids are saying 'Why didn't you do more?' Now is the time that we can put our resources where our thought processes and our mouths are. We can now do the right thing. And as the baby boomer market matures, more and more of those people are going to be looking towards true sustainability, not just a buzzword, for their choices."

Abstract: Because his business is in selling -- he founded and runs Might & Main, one of Portland's best-known branding and design firms -- Wilkinson has helped define the Maine aesthetic that emerged in full force alongside the farm-to-table-driven sustainability movement, from Rising Tide's man-in-a-rowboat logo to Eventide's oyster-shell-themed logo. Or solid, like a waterfront restaurant serving the freshest, most ethically sourced seafood on steel tabletops salvaged from Bath Iron Works.

Full text:   he other day Sean Wilkinson was boiling maple sap in his backyard while drinking a Moxie. He was also wearing buffalo plaid and Bean boots. As he sipped and made syrup he was struck by the fact that he looked like a walking cliche. Like one of those Brooklyn hipsters who latch onto the notion of Maine and try to appropriate it in one long pine-scented gulp of rusticity.
"I realized even my brother who lives in Brooklyn would make fun of me and say, 'Stop trying so hard,'" Wilkinson said.
But, as he points out, "I am really not playing a part, I have a maple tree and I genuinely like Moxie." The Bean boots and buffalo plaid? He grew up in Winthrop, went to Maine College of Art, tried out another place (Seattle) and then came home. He's not faking it.
Because his business is in selling -- he founded and runs Might & Main, one of Portland's best-known branding and design firms -- Wilkinson has helped define the Maine aesthetic that emerged in full force alongside the farm-to-table-driven sustainability movement, from Rising Tide's man-in-a-rowboat logo to Eventide's oyster-shell-themed logo.
Wilkinson wants to conjure up images and branding that is "timeless and industrial and charming," and Maine.
"Without saying pine trees and buoys and lighthouses." He's done it with words, and images, and even an accessory line for Might & Main called the 1820 Collection, featuring the Dirigo Beanie and the Mackworth Canvas Tote.
He and others describe the Maine aesthetic as rustic. It's authentic. Outdoorsy, obviously, and homemade, but homemade with an edge of sophistication. In font form, it is probably rustic (although not faux hand-drawn, Wilkinson cautions; that would be trying too hard).
As a handknit sweater, it might be named for a Portland neighborhood or street, like Rosemont, and made with wool dyed -- organically -- in an old mill in Biddeford. It's a leather handbag designed and made in Maine, photographed lusciously (although let's face it, incongruously) on the rocks.
It can be ephemeral, like an Instagram feed featuring newborn animals, muddy boots and cornmeal freshly ground in a kitchen in Monroe. Or solid, like a waterfront restaurant serving the freshest, most ethically sourced seafood on steel tabletops salvaged from Bath Iron Works. (That last would be Scales, Sam Hayward and Dana Street's new place in Portland.)
Don't mock.
OK, mock. But keep this in mind; the Maine-made aesthetic sells. Well. In and out of the state. At least at this particular junction in American social history. There is a reason L.L. Bean still cuts and stitches its boat and tote bags and Bean boots in Maine, even as most of its merchandise gets made overseas. In merchandising terms, the state itself lends a priceless piece of credibility.
Few understand how hard it is to define the Maine aesthetic better than the Maine Office of Tourism. In a six-minute video explaining the campaign that began in 2011, scenes of gorgeous Maine scenery roll by while a voice-over describes the state's "brand platform."
Extolling the state's people, hand-crafted goods and "uncommon experiences" we're told, "Maine has a mystique all of its own. It is a strangely hard to define quality, but you know it when you see it. It is something we call the Maine Thing."
That term, the Maine Thing, is also the name of an emailed newsletter the tourism office sends out quarterly, a slick piece of eye candy that pays as much, if not more, attention to farm-to-table and brewpub Maine as it does to lighthouses. The concept of the campaign focuses far more on core consumer values than traditional sightseeing. "We really recognized the need to make this emotional connection," said Carolann Ouellette, director of the Maine Office of Tourism.
The Maine Thing was conceived of by BVK, an advertising agency based in Milwaukee that won the bid to represent Maine branding as it relates to tourism. The slogan is vague, youthful and presumably intentionally unpolished, the kind of term someone would come up with as they were shrugging their shoulders to say "look, I can't explain it, it just is and it's awesome." E. B. White would likely grimace in disgust at its lack of linguistic precision.
But it seems to be working.
In 2015, first-time visitation increased 8.3 percent over the previous year, which had an even more impressive jump, 43.5 percent over 2013 first-time visits. Overall the number of tourists visiting the state was up 3 percent in 2015 and 10 percent in 2014. This could be attributed at least in part to an improving economy and a decrease in the cost of fuel that has more Americans traveling domestically, but the Maine Office of Tourism attributes the uptick to its rebranding strategy.
"It had been flat and even in a bit of decline until we shifted into this campaign," Ouellette said.
The latest component of the campaign has been what Ouellette describes as a "very aggressive" segmentation study. "We wanted to know which consumer groups most identified with the Maine brand," she said. Of the six identified, the three that were considered to be most likely to visit Maine were balanced achievers, genuine originals and social sophisticates. The social sophisticates are more about appearances and achievement but the first two groups cite the importance of a living a green, environmentally friendly lifestyle. That's why it makes sense that Maine attempted to woo future tourists by placing ads in a magazine like Outside, where subscriber values and interests run along the same lines. Those values are important enough to give a trip to say, Acadia, the edge over the Jersey Shore. For the nearly 100,000 Maine jobs supported by tourism, that matters.
I-know-it-when-I-see-it is a means of assessment generally associated with pornography, as in U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's 1964 pronouncement in an obscenity case based around an Ohio ban on the Louis Malle movie "The Lovers." But it can apply to tourism advertising and to design as well. Take Troy Tyler's decision six years ago to change up the packaging for Portland General Store, the high-end "grooming" essentials company based on York Street.
He and his wife, Lisa, started the company in 2007 after moving to Maine from Brooklyn.
Their first labels were handprinted, "generic apothecary," Troy Tyler says. Nice but, like the Mason jar, too omnipresent now to be distinctive. "I love that aesthetic but the problem with it is you don't make a brand." He pushed for a new design, which he said Lisa and customers resisted. The interlaced typeface he chose had a Depression-era feeling, like the kind of stamp one might see on a machine. Or a gun, like Smith & Wesson. Or in its vintage form, on the side of the Portland Company building nearby and in 21st century form, on the Central Provisions logo. It's a heritage feeling that to Tyler embodied a solidity and authenticity that reflected what they wanted their brand to stand for.
"Something that is here to stay and is very well made and that we care about," he said.
Having "Portland" in the brand name -- he said they registered the store name before they left New York -- gives them a Maine vibe that he says plays "really, really well" outside of the state. Ninety-nine percent of their sales are out of state (many in Canada, which Tyler attributes in part to the Canadian fondness for Maine as a vacation spot).
"I like to tell people we are sending Maine around the world," Tyler said.
Their products include Uncle Jim's Hardscrabble Hunting Camp soap, a "Saltwater" cologne (vegan, organic and featuring Atlantic sea salt "to give it an authentic, fresh twist") and a "Farmer's" cologne (which was mocked in the pages of the Los Angeles Times for being a $110 product tailored to have a calming effect on cows). Ten percent of the sales of the Farmer's cologne are donated to the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, and Portland General Store also donates to the Maine State Beekeeper Association. The Tylers have carefully positioned their company to be associated with Maine, and thus with other heritage personal care companies, like Burt's Bees and Tom's of Maine (which are no longer made or headquartered in Maine). Is it Maine-washing, i.e., a location equivalent of greenwashing? Whatever the case, it has been good business. In another life, he might have done something more directly linked to the sustainability movement.
"Had I not done Portland General Store, I would have done something with the Slow Food agricultural movement," Tyler said.
Designer Hannah Fettig lives in a 750-square-foot house in Kennebunk and has 23,900 followers on Instagram, where she goes by @knitbot, the name of her company. Her knitware is like some sort of mad marriage of Eileen Fisher elegant ease, hipster cool and the kind of hard-to-define Maine "thing" that the state pays BVK to come up with.
About a decade ago Fettig fell in with a knitting crowd at Knitwit in Portland, got a job there and found herself "head over heels with knitting." Her design of a sweater she called the Whisper Cardigan made her name in 2009 and she sold 16,000 copies of the pattern for her next hit, the Featherweight cardigan. The design principle was based on the kind of drapey, jersey clothing she liked to wear. Then she and a friend who lives on the central California coast collaborated on a book called "Coastal Knits," filled with lush photographs of sweaters inspired by their own coasts. Her sweaters had names like Bayside, Water's Edge and Rocky Coast.
"We are here in Maine and we want to use what we have," she said. "And what we have is pretty amazing."
That's what Wilkinson refers to as authenticity. But it turned out to have an aspirational appeal, even to people who don't knit.
"Some people told us they bought it as a coffee-table book," Fettig said.
Fettig is the flipside to the Tylers, who very consciously created their version of the Maine aesthetic with the awareness that it would play well elsewhere. After the success of "Coastal Knits" (it sold about 30,000 copies, she said) she had a realization about the way her home state resonated.
"People have a very romantic view of Maine," she said. "A lot of people have been here at least once and they have that as a very positive, nostalgic part of their memory."
All the sweaters in her latest book, "Home & Away," have Maine names, including Georgetown, named for the town where she and friends Dan and Neesha Hudson photographed and styled each piece. The model wears a pair of vintage Bean boots in every shot, including the dreamy cover photo of snow falling over the sea. She's holding a suitcase Fettig found the day before at Goodwill. Another sweater was photographed in front of the workshop where Docksmith's driftwood docking stations are made ("bringing nature into people's high-tech lives since 2011").
It's a beautiful book, the kind that can send you right to the website of another Maine company, Quince, which Fettig frequently collaborates with, to order up a dozen or so skeins of wool and set to work on a project, that yes, might make you feel like a Mainer, but a 21st-century one, feeding the chickens in local far-from-yokel style.
About that aspirational quality that sells Maine, will it dwindle? The question is on Fettig's mind.
"I literally hit a point a couple of weeks ago where I was just kind of looking at what is going on and thinking, am I gagging on the Maine experience right now?" Fettig said. "Is it too much?"
She's gone from being a knitter with not a lot of business acumen -- she nearly brushed off her first publisher's offer to do a book when she was getting started -- to an experienced marketer. She thinks about over-saturation.
"It is hitting me so that probably means it is hitting other people," she said. "I am not saying anything anyone is doing is wrong. I just want to keep it authentic for me."
She doesn't want to contribute to anyone feeling that the Maine Thing, as it were, is being overused. Neither does Wilkinson. His client list includes Piccolo, Home Remedies, Central Provisions and newcomer Roustabout.
"I would love to be able to brand restaurants for the next 25 years," he said. "But there is a potential for saturation, and we want to be careful about that."
He's expanding Might & Main's reach, including to a couple of restaurants due to open in Boston at the end of the summer. He's found that clients outside of Maine are drawn to his aesthetic, Maine inspired or otherwise. He's not running a fire sale on the Dirigo line any time soon.
"We might be getting to a tipping point, but I don't think it is going to be a precipitous fall," Wilkinson said. "I don't think we are even going to notice, but things are just going to ramp down."

on clean energy action
The legislative discussions on the solar bill, L.D. 1649, are falling victim to the same ideological conflicts that make Congress totally ineffective. But climate change isn't liberal or conservative -- it's about the world we are leaving our children and grandchildren.
The argument against L.D. 1649 is that it will increase utility rates and therefore harm businesses. In fact, the ratepayer impact of the bill is minimal. As in most legislative discussions, the focus is on the near-term economic impact. More importantly, the discussion misses the long-term climate change implications for the ski, snowmobile, forestry, fishing, shellfish and maple syrup businesses.
We have in the state and in the nation a responsibility to address the biggest threat to our lives and livelihood, but global warming is on the low end of legislative priorities. The Legislature should propose legislation that will encourage the expansion of solar installations by towns, individual homeowners, businesses, schools and other entities, and the governor should sign it.
We also need to look at other clean energy sources because we are now below 10 percent renewable. Hydro Quebec is at our doorstep -- a huge, clean resource. Environmentalists have been opposed or ambivalent about hydropower, but the climate change threat demands the elimination of fossil fuels.
We are now paying for up to $75 million to build natural gas infrastructure. Natural gas burns more cleanly than coal or oil, but there are widespread leaks of methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) from the source through the pipe network.
So we're subsidizing a fossil fuel, but somehow solar growth is interpreted as too costly.
We should expect our legislators and our governor to enact legislation to advance clean energy now. The state, our nation and the world have already waited far too long.

Shellfish license opens up in Scarborough

Author: Bridgers, Leslie

Publication info: Morning Sentinel ; Waterville, Me. [Waterville, Me]09 Apr 2016: 2.B.

Abstract: About half of the license holders dig clams full time, some as often as seven days a week, said Robert Willette, chairman of the town's Shellfish Conservation Commission and one of the lucky license holders.

Full text:   SCARBOROUGH -- The town clerk's office closed Tuesday and Steve Snow hadn't shown.
One of 30 residents who hold commercial shellfish licenses, Snow had started working as a merchant mariner and had plans to move to Florida, people had heard.
So when his license came up for its annual renewal this week, he let it lapse -- leaving behind a way to change someone's life.
There's no limit to how long Scarborough residents can hold on to their shellfish licenses, and many who are lucky enough to land them keep them for the rest of their lives, or at least as long as they can do the work.
About half of the license holders dig clams full time, some as often as seven days a week, said Robert Willette, chairman of the town's Shellfish Conservation Commission and one of the lucky license holders.
Others, like him, cobble together a living between clamming and other jobs. Willette does carpentry and works on cars, on top of spending five days a week on the flats.
The hours of the profession depend on the tides. It's feasible to dig from about three hours before low tide to three hours after, said Willette.
The time of day when that occurs can affect how many clams diggers can collect, since they're restricted to digging between half an hour before sunrise and half an hour after sunset, he said.
Willette said that even for those who dig clams every day, their annual income would fall far short of six figures.
Tody Justice, the town clerk of more than 20 years, remembers lotteries for shellfish licenses when people lined up out the door. She doesn't remember a time when Snow wasn't one of the people who held one.
Although two came up for grabs last year, it's unusual for a commercial license to become available two years in a row, and it's usually much longer between lotteries, Justice said.
On Friday afternoon, 13 Scarborough residents showed up at the clerk's office for a chance at the single license, although about 40 people were there all together, including children and teenagers who hoped to get one of two student licenses that had become available.
Twelve-year-old Nolan Orff wanted to be able to go out with his older brother, who already has a student license, and make some money to start saving for college.
Their father, Chris Orff, a Portland firefighter, applied for the commercial license so he could go with them.
They weren't the only applicants who were related. Twenty-something siblings Sarah and Casey Violette, whose father is a commercial fisherman, were both hoping for the opportunity to have a bigger hand in the family business.
Then there was 55-year-old Nancy Rodoalph, whose job making pizza and sandwiches at a local convenience store doesn't bring in enough income.
She moved from Cape Cod, where she cleaned houses, to her sister and brother-in-law's house in Scarborough a couple of years ago, hoping there would be more work opportunities here.
Her sister's husband, David Green, who has a commercial shellfish license, hoped she'd win because he didn't think she'd end up using it, he said, and there's already enough competition on the flats.
After checking into the clerk's office, each applicant watched a small strip of paper with their name printed on it get placed in a basket with others of the exact same size, folded in the same way.
Justice has been accused of fixing the lottery before, so she makes sure that everything is precise -- and she doesn't pick the winner.
That job has been taken over by Colette Mathieson, the town manager's executive assistant.
The applicants, along with their friends and family members, were lined up along a wall in the Scarborough Municipal Building when Justice came out of the clerk's office with the basket in her hand and Mathieson by her side.
"Drum roll," Mathieson said before reaching into the basket and selecting a paper strip.
It was Rodoalph. Her niece Jessica Holbrook laughed.
Green had gotten his wish.

Abstract: Glen Gawarkiewicz, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said that as of a week ago the water temperature recorded at a key offshore measuring buoy on the Nantucket Shoals at the southern edge of the Gulf was 44.1 degrees, just 0.7 degrees cooler than the same day in 2012.

Full text:   With the United States coming off the warmest winter on record, scientists are monitoring the Gulf of Maine for a possible repeat of an "ocean heat wave" four years ago that led to the destruction of clam populations, a collapse of Maine lobster prices, and incursions of warm-water species such as squid and blue crabs into Maine bays.
"We're pretty much locked in now to 2012-like conditions," says Andrew Pershing, chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland. "If you look at the temperatures right now in the Gulf of Maine, these are the temperatures you expect to see in mid-April, and it seems we've really stopped cooling."
"If it's like 2012, temperatures will hover for a few weeks and then really pick up," he added.
Pershing, who has been monitoring buoy and satellite data as part of a lobster forecasting project, expects 2012-like phenomena this year: an explosion of clam-eating green crabs, lobsters molting extremely early, and sightings of mid-Atlantic species. He was the lead author in a scientific study published in the journal Science last October that suggested the warming gulf was a major factor in the failure of cod populations to recover despite fishing restrictions.
Glen Gawarkiewicz, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said that as of a week ago the water temperature recorded at a key offshore measuring buoy on the Nantucket Shoals at the southern edge of the Gulf was 44.1 degrees, just 0.7 degrees cooler than the same day in 2012.
"We have passed the worst of the cooling season in winter, so I would not expect big temperature drops at this point," he says. "I think there is a strong possibility that the temperatures this summer will be comparable, and possibly slightly below that of 2012."
This winter was the warmest in the U.S. since records began 121 years ago, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with Maine and the other five New England states breaking their individual all-time average winter temperature records, the only states in the country to do so. Maine and Massachusetts were the only states in the country to also break their records for the highest single winter temperature reading.
But Nick Record, a research scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay, says he's not certain the warming trend is set in stone. A cooler-than-average spring and early summer could prevent a recurrence of an "ocean heat wave" like that in 2012, which triggered an explosion of clam-eating green crabs and caused lobsters to shed so early in the season they disrupted lobster markets. (Disclosure: This reporter is a Bigelow trustee.)
"It's more likely at this point that we'd have a warm summer and a heat wave than in a typical year, but it isn't guaranteed," Record says. "But if we did have another year that's off the charts, it's important for us to carefully observe what happens because we're one of the first parts of the world ocean to have gone through these really rapid changes."
Record has been crowd-sourcing observations of unusual species, especially jellyfish, but also squid eggs and other phenomena, emailed to him by Maine residents (jellyfish@bigelow.org) in an effort to get as many eyes on the changes that occur when gulf water temperatures spike.
During the winter of 2011-2012, unusually warm temperatures caused the gulf to never properly cool down, and things warmed further through the summer, sending shock waves throughout the ecosystem.
Lobstermen started catching mounds of newly shed lobsters in May, six weeks ahead of their usual schedule, creating a glut that threw off the overwhelmed Maritime Canadian processing plants that usually purchase most of these fragile softshells, which aren't hardy enough for the live whole lobster trade. Prices fell so low the processors eventually jumped in, buying up the glut of cheap Maine lobsters instead of local lobsters, prompting eastern New Brunswick lobstermen to blockade trucks of Maine lobsters to prevent them from unloading.
On Eastern Egg Rock, puffin chicks starved because their parents were unable to find appropriate food for them, while off Grand Manan Island, northern right whales failed to find swarms of the tiny, cold-dependent marine copeods they like to eat.
Meanwhile, the warmer water triggered an explosion in the population of green crabs, which proceeded to devour most of the clams in Freeport, Brunswick, Penobscot and other towns.
Brian Beal, a marine shellfish ecologist at the University of Maine at Machias and the Downeast Institute, says the overall mass of green crab went down as the Gulf cooled in 2014 to 2015, but there are still large numbers of them -- they're just smaller.
"If seawater temperatures increase quickly in the spring and summer like in 2012-2013, we could see another explosion in the larger ones later in the summer or early fall," he says.
Chad Coffin, of Freeport, president of the Maine Clammers Association, says that would be a disaster.
"Here in Casco Bay, the soft shell clam industry has totally collapsed and a return to water temperatures experienced in 2012 could spell doom for a rebound that clammers have pinned to juvenile clams," he says.
Experts say there's little that Maine can do by itself to address the underlying issue: the continued warming of the Earth because of greenhouse gas emissions from factories, cars, power plants, livestock feedlots and other human activities. Maine produces just 0.32 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or about 0.05 percent of those in the world.
Instead, they say, Mainers could mitigate the damage by shoring up the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, reducing other stresses we can control and learning ways to protect resources from some of the worst effects, including ocean acidification, a byproduct of the changing climate that hampers the survival of at least some juvenile shellfish species.

Full text:   study finds
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. -- A new study, based on the most extensive set of measurements ever made in tide pools, suggests that ocean acidification will increasingly put many marine organisms at risk by exacerbating normal changes in ocean chemistry that occur overnight.
Conducted along California's rocky coastline, the study shows that the most vulnerable organisms are likely to be those with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.
Ocean acidification is occurring as the oceans absorb increasing amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, where carbon dioxide concentrations are steadily rising because of emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Absorption of carbon dioxide changes seawater chemistry, pushing it toward the lower, acidic end of the pH scale, although it remains slightly alkaline. A small decrease in pH affects the chemical equilibrium of ocean water, reducing the availability of carbonate ions needed by a wide range of organisms to build and maintain structures of calcium carbonate, such as the shells of mussels and oysters.
Kristy Kroeker, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is a co-author of the new study, published Friday in Scientific Reports.
"There is a lot of concern about how ocean acidification is going to affect marine species in the future, but most of our understanding comes from laboratory studies where a single organism is exposed to acidified seawater under very controlled conditions for a short period of time," Kroeker said. "In reality, every organism is embedded in a complex community that experiences dynamic environmental conditions that will gradually change over time."
In the new study, researchers closely monitored conditions in tide pools along California's rocky coast, which are isolated from the open ocean during low tides. During the daytime, photosynthesis -- the mechanism by which plants use the sun's energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar, giving off oxygen in the process -- takes up carbon dioxide from the seawater and acts to reverse ocean acidification's effects. At night, however, photosynthesis stops, while the respiration of plants and animals takes up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. This adds carbon dioxide to the seawater and exacerbates the effects of ocean acidification, increasing the risk to calcifying organisms.
"Tide pools are home to lots of different species," Kroeker said. "Tide pools can experience particularly corrosive seawater during nighttime low tides, when all of the animals are 'exhaling' carbon dioxide into the water that has been cut off from the ocean."
The research team, led by scientists at the Carnegie Institution of Science, used these natural nighttime spikes in corrosive conditions to examine how entire communities of marine species respond to natural acidification. Observing a variety of California's natural rocky tide pools near the Bodega Marine Laboratory, they found that the rate of shell and skeletal growth was not greatly affected by seawater chemistry in the daytime. However, during low tide at night, water in the tide pools became corrosive to calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. The study found evidence that the rate at which these shells and skeletons dissolved during these nighttime periods was greatly affected by seawater chemistry.
"Unless carbon dioxide emissions are rapidly curtailed, we expect ocean acidification to continue to lower the pH of seawater," said lead author Lester Kwiatkowski of the Carnegie Institution of Science. "This work highlights that even in today's temperate coastal oceans, calcifying species, such as mussels and coralline algae, can dissolve during the night due to the more acidic conditions caused by community respiration."
These results highlight the vulnerability of marine species in even the most dynamic conditions to the global process of ocean acidification, Kroeker said.
According to coauther Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution, "If what we see happening along California's coast today is indicative of what will continue in the coming decades, by the year 2050 there will likely be twice as much nighttime dissolution as there is today. Nobody really knows how our coastal ecosystems will respond to these corrosive waters, but it certainly won't be well."
The study was a collaborative effort by the Carnegie Institution for Science, the University of California, Davis and UC Santa Cruz. This work was funded by the Carnegie Institution for Science, UC Multi-campus Research Initiatives and Programs and the National Science Foundation.

Full text:   The body of the former teacher was discovered last month, a few years after her death
From time to time, Edie Clouse wondered what became of her old friend Lucie McNulty.
They used to talk on the phone after Lucie retired in 2001 from a three-decade career of teaching music, sold her house in Amherst, New York, and moved 500 miles away to Maine.
"If she felt like talking, she would talk for an hour," Clouse said. "If she didn't ... well, you wouldn't get much."
The calls soon grew less frequent, then stopped altogether. Clouse's messages went unreturned. She couldn't remember the last time she and Lucie spoke.
Last month, the news reached Clouse in western New York that her friend had died. Her remains were discovered inside her cluttered mobile home in Wells. She had been dead for an estimated 2½ years.
"She was an amazing person ... a complicated person," Clouse said recently from her home, where she and her husband, Joseph, run an instrument repair shop. "To think she had no one in her life in the end is just ... it's just unbelievably sad."
People wondered: How could this happen?
How could the death of a woman described by friends and co-workers as outgoing and funny, a woman remembered fondly by students even decades later, a woman who inspired beautiful music and was a gifted musician herself go unnoticed?
The seclusion that defined Lucie's final years was no accident. Interviews with people who knew her at various points in her life, a visit to the community where she spent most of her adulthood and a review of court documents revealed that her isolation from the world was gradual and deliberate.
Lucie McNulty structured her life to be solitary, shutting out friends, leaving the community where she was well known for a private home on a wooded street where neighbors mostly left her alone.
In the process she appeared to abandon the one constant in her life, the thing that gave her joy and purpose: music.
Dawn Cavaretta, a former colleague and friend, once asked Lucie if she planned to teach private music lessons or join community bands or orchestras in Maine.
"Why would I do that?" she replied, as if the question was absurd.
At some point for Lucie McNulty, the music just stopped.
Lucie was born March 14, 1946, the only child of Leo and Lucy McNulty, naming her after her mother but changing the spelling.
She was raised in Seaford, New York, a small town on the South Shore of Long Island. Her father worked in quality control for a major airplane manufacturer. Her mother stayed home. The family had a boat and spent weekends on South Oyster Bay.
Lucie did well in school. She participated in Girl Scouts and took an early interest in music. A black-and-white photo in her middle school yearbook shows a freckled-faced girl with a warm smile.
Mark D. McNulty, Lucie's first cousin, lived in a nearby town. He was two years younger. They spent time at each other's homes in the 1950s and early 1960s.
"My aunt and uncle were so proud of Lucie and her musical abilities," said McNulty, who now lives in California. "Every time we went over for dinner they would tell Lucie to play her flute for us."
Mark said he and his cousin were friendly but not close. His lasting impressions of her as a young girl and teenager were of a sarcastic sense of humor that belied her age and a profound sensitivity.
"When the adults went off and did what they did, we would talk," he said. "I feel like there was never a time I was at her house that she didn't break down in tears. She had these real feelings, even at a young age."
McNulty said Lucie was insecure as a teenager, slightly overweight and likely teased by her peers. But music gave her a sense of confidence.
At Seaford High School, Lucie wasn't popular but she wasn't an outcast either, classmates said. She continued to excel in band and dreamed of being a music teacher.
Karla Held, who graduated with Lucie in 1964, said she remembers Lucie's distinctive red hair and her musical acumen.
"She was always the best, first chair," Held said, referring to the traditional post in a concert band for the most skilled player within an instrument class.
Lucie's senior portrait shows a young woman with a closed-mouth half-smile, her hair cut short and up in a 1960s style with a single strand of pearls around her neck. Below the picture, she listed her likes and dislikes.
"Lucie likes boys with black hair, fast cars, beach parties, green sweaters, band trips, Fredonia College and Chanel No. 5.
"She dislikes school gym suits, marching practice, all math, carrying books and short skirts."
In the yearbook's class will section, Lucie wrote, "I hereby leave my thanks to Mr. Harrington, Mrs. Lieberman and Mr. Mech for putting some music in my life."
After high school, she attended college at State University of New York -- Fredonia, on the eastern edge of Lake Erie. Fredonia was, and still is, a well-regarded school for both music education and teaching.
Lucie graduated in 1968 and started teaching two years later. She was hired by the Williamsville Central School District, a large district that serves Amherst, Buffalo's biggest suburb, and a few smaller surrounding towns in western New York.
The district had become well-known for its music program, in large part because of Frank Del Russo, the longtime band director who was also a renowned musician before becoming an educator. Del Russo supervised her for many years.
"She was a hard worker and her bands always did really well," said Del Russo, now 84. "A little gruff at times, but the students responded to her."
Gary Stith, a high school band director in Williamsville who taught with Lucie, had the same impression.
"I could always tell which students were hers once they reached high school," he said.
"In band, every student has to do well or you notice. It's not like math, where if 90 percent of students get it 90 percent right, that's pretty good. If that were to happen in band, it would be a disaster. (Lucie's) bands were never like that. They were always on."
She was a tough teacher.
Sara Bevilacqua, a student in the early 1990s, said, "She was the one who told me I wasn't serious enough about playing the flute if I didn't want to cut my nails down to nothing. She gave us a challenge, but only so we could rise up to meet it."
But she was funny, too. She used to tell students the "5-second rule" didn't apply to food that fell on the band room floor because there was too much spit there. She loved Garfield, the lazy, lasagna-loving cat from Jim Davis' comic strip, and thought actor Tom Cruise was gorgeous.
Her concerts always ended in standing ovations.
Melinda Saran, now a vice dean at SUNY Buffalo Law School, was a student of Lucie's in elementary school in the 1970s.
"I wanted to play clarinet, but she convinced me to try alto saxophone," Saran said. "She was so enthusiastic about music. She was tough with students but never critical. She just wanted us to try harder.
"You know, there are very few teachers I remember, but she was definitely one of them."
Outside of school, Lucie was enigmatic. Social at times, a loner at others.
But she found confidence in what she knew best: music. She gave private lessons on wind instruments such as the clarinet or the flute. She played in several orchestras and philharmonic groups in Greater Buffalo, including the Erie County Wind Ensemble.
Yvonne Rivers Michaels played French horn in several of those bands with Lucie, including the Erie County group. She said Lucie's music skills stood out, even among accomplished musicians.
"She was very skilled," Michaels said, "and you could tell she enjoyed playing."
Stith, her former colleague, also heard Lucie play flute numerous times over the years in various concert bands.
"She had this tone; it was big and beautiful and really stood out," he said.
Cavaretta called Lucie's playing remarkable.
"It would make your hair stand up," she said. "She had such a command of the instrument, and there was this emotion in her playing."
With people, though, she maintained her distance. Stith said the music department in the Williamsville district would often have get-togethers a few times a year, holiday parties or spring barbecues. Lucie was always invited, but she never came.
Once, only because her principal asked, Lucie posed for a picture for the 1988-89 school yearbook. But then never again. Nobody who knew her could produce a photograph of her as an adult.
For most of the 1970s and early 1980s, Lucie lived in an apartment complex, Foxberry Village, on the outskirts of Amherst. It was close to the schools where she taught -- Maple West Elementary, then Heim Middle School, then Casey Middle School.
In 1978, her father retired from a career in the aviation industry, and he and his wife moved upstate to be closer to their only child.
Ron Shubert, an attorney in Buffalo, was neighbors with Leo and Lucy McNulty for nearly two decades in East Amherst and got to know Lucie well.
"She was always at her parents' house," he said. "They were very close."
Shubert described Lucie's mother as "jittery." Her father, he said, was a "drunk."
As for Lucie, "she certainly was gruff, not someone you could warm up to; but at the same time, I never had any problems with her," he said.
Lucie bought her own home in 1985, a two-story brick bungalow less than 10 miles from her parents' condominium.
Michaels remembers Lucie hosting a few parties at her house for some of the band groups they were in together, a detail that seemed at odds with her persona.
"It was a lovely home," Michaels said, "and she seemed very comfortable hosting people."
Cavaretta, her former colleague and friend, said Lucie kept in the house cassette tapes of every concert she ever conducted. Dozens and dozens of them.
"I said to her once, 'Lucie, do you really listen to these?'" Cavaretta said. "But she did."
In early 1997, Lucie's mother was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, said Shubert, the former neighbor. The disease progressed quickly and she died later that year.
Lucie was devastated but responded to her mother's death in an unusual way. There was no service, no will, no obituary. On the day of her mother's death, she went to work.
"I remember her telling someone sort of matter-of-factly that she called the funeral home to 'come take the couch and my mother,'" Shubert said.
Less than two years later, her father got sick, too. In June 1999, he suffered a heart attack and died. He was living with Lucie at the time of his death, according to his death certificate.
There was no service or obituary for Leo McNulty, either. His will, filed in Erie County Surrogate's Court, left everything to his only daughter.
The condominium in East Amherst was sold in February 2000. Four months later, Lucie bought a 750-square foot mobile home on Atkins Lane, just off Route 109 in Wells, Maine. She had visited the state many times with her parents, both as a child and as an adult. It was a place where people could be left alone.
About one year later, Lucie sold her home in Amherst and retired. She was 55 but had 31 years of experience and her pension was fully vested. Her monthly payout was $4,432.68, about $53,000 annually, according to the New York State Teachers' Retirement System, and it was deposited directly into her bank account beginning in June 2001. Those payments continued after her death, because the retirement system didn't know she had died.
Cavaretta helped Lucie move to Maine in 2001.
She said Lucie had been on dates in her younger years but never had any lasting relationships. She was resigned to being single and childless.
"She was OK with it," the friend said. "She used to say, 'I'm alone, but I'm not lonely.'"
Clouse, Lucie's other longtime friend, wasn't as sure. "I think she was lonely," she said. "I can't say for sure why, but I think she had a broken heart."
Lucie didn't avoid her neighbors in Wells, but she didn't embrace them either.
Lois Martin, who lives two houses away, remembers conversations with Lucie as pleasant but said she kept people at a distance.
It didn't take long for Lucie to burn bridges, though. As part of her deed, she was to split the cost of plowing the road with other residents. Lucie objected and refused to pay.
Neighbors would knock on the door. Lucie never answered. Sometimes, they would call her. She never picked up the phone.
For several years, she seemed to live in complete anonymity. Neighbors never saw her, except when she drove to the end of the road to retrieve packages that came daily.
Clouse still talked to Lucie on the phone in the early years after she moved to Maine. Even after the calls ended, she would still send cards at Christmastime and even got some in return. Once, she received a card from Lucie postmarked from Hawaii, but that was at least a few years ago, she guessed.
Clouse said the card from Hawaii gave her some comfort, a sense that her friend was OK.
In Maine, though, there were signs that the isolation may have been getting to Lucie.
In June 2011, she called police, complaining that someone was spraying a chemical into her window air conditioner. The police log call indicates that the responding officer noted possible mental health problems.
A week later, Lucie called police to say that someone had come onto her property without permission and disconnected her garden hose.
In September 2011, Lucie reported that someone had pounded on her door in the middle of the night. She told the dispatcher that someone sprayed something into her house that was irritating her skin.
In January 2012, she called police twice, once to say that a plow truck had plowed in her driveway and another time about the plow truck damaging her mailbox.
Her next call to 911 was for an ambulance. She complained of right leg pain and was taken to a local hospital. That was July 22, 2013, the last time neighbors recalled seeing her.
A hospital staff member told police investigating her death that there was a note attached to Lucie's hospital file from that visit. It said that the hospital has staff members who assist older patients like Lucie who have no family or support system.
The staff member said someone was supposed to contact Lucie after her release from the hospital to walk her through the process of securing a regular physician and building some sort of support system. The staff member tried to call Lucie, according to police, but the phone was disconnected.
One of the neighbors called police on Aug. 6 to report that Lucie had not been seen since she left in the ambulance more than two weeks earlier. Police contacted the hospital and discovered that she had been released. No one followed up.
The next summer police got another call from an unidentified party wanting someone to check on Lucie. Police encouraged the caller to check with local hospitals, but it doesn't appear they did anything more.
In January 2015, police got yet another call from out of state. Lucie had not been seen or heard from in several months. Could someone check on her?
Police went to the door and knocked. No one answered, but nothing was obviously amiss. They didn't pursue her whereabouts further.
A full year later, on Jan. 8, 2016, just after 10 a.m., Detective Joseph LaBier and Sgt. Chad Arrowsmith went to 43 Atkins Lane one more time. The property taxes had not been paid for the last two years and the town had begun foreclosure proceedings.
When the officers arrived, the driveway was unplowed and there were no footprints or tire tracks. The skirting on the mobile home was collapsing. There was mold on the blinds and curtains. The oil tank was empty.
This time, they were determined to enter the home.
The door was locked, and the detectives didn't want to damage the lock. They noticed a duct on one of the windows and were able to open the window enough for LaBier to climb through. He announced his presence but got no answer, so he made his way to the front door to let his partner in.
The house was filled with "belongings stacked up from the floor to the ceiling," LaBier wrote in his police report, obtained through a public records request. "There was only one small path approximately 18 inches wide to navigate from the front door to the bathroom."
The officer searched the living area and kitchen. When he tried to open a bedroom door, though, it opened only a couple of inches.
Rather than force the door open, one of the officers put his hands in and took pictures with a digital camera.
When they looked at the pictures, they saw Lucie's body, badly decomposed on the floor, wedged against the door and a bureau. The officers had to take the bedroom door off its hinges to allow the medical examiner's office investigator access to the body.
Lucie's cause of death was ischemic cardiovascular disease, a narrowing of the arteries that results in decreased flow of blood and oxygen to the heart.
But also listed in the ME's report, under "other significant conditions," was chronic alcoholism.
Asked how the medical examiner made that determination, a spokesman for the office said all cases involved a thorough review of a person's medical history. All of those medical records are confidential, even in death, but excessive alcohol consumption and heart disease are linked.
LaBier wrote in his police report that they found seven 1.75-liter bottles of vodka in the refrigerator and freezer.
Neighbors in Wells seemed to be aware of Lucie's alcohol consumption. One neighbor remembers talking to Lucie on her front steps and seeing a roomful of empty bottles beyond the partially open door. Another neighbor remembered Lucie asking what she drank and then producing a bottle of it the next time they met. It was 10:30 in the morning.
Cavaretta knew about Lucie's drinking, too. During some of their last phone calls, she remembers Lucie slurring her words significantly.
"It sounds horrible to say it this way, but didn't the guy at the liquor store wonder where she was?" she said.

Mark McNulty found out about his cousin's death in mid-January. He received a letter from a company in New York that researches unclaimed assets.
"At first I thought it was a scam, so I called my attorney," he said. "Then, once he convinced me it was legit, I started brainstorming who it could be. I thought of Lucie."
McNulty didn't have her phone number but remembered she had moved to Maine. On Jan. 19, he opened a Web browser and typed "Lucie McNulty Wells Maine," into the search bar.
"The stories came up and I thought, 'Oh, my word,'" he said. "I was beyond shock. I just couldn't believe how long she was in there alone."
Cavaretta was similarly shaken.
Wells police called her after they found a copy of Lucie's will inside the mobile home and saw Cavaretta's name listed as executrix. Cavaretta knew that, of course. They had talked about it back in 2000 before Lucie moved.
"She said, 'I don't want my property to go to the state,'" Cavaretta said.
But as with so many others, Lucie had pushed her away, too. Cavaretta wouldn't say what happened, only that she knew that the fracture in their friendship would never be repaired.
"It was awful, thinking that she died in that way," she said, struggling to hold back tears. "She was my friend."
Students whose lasting memory was an enigmatic woman with an unrivaled passion for teaching music said they hoped that would be her legacy, not her death.
Old friends and co-workers wondered if more could have been done to prevent Lucie from dying all alone, but they also understood that she possibly wanted it that way.
Neighbors were concerned after she disappeared but never pushed to find out what happened, partially because she was not friendly. Police and medical professionals pushed only so far because no one was pushing them.
It was assumed Lucie had up and left, not that she was still inside the home, dead.
"It's hard thinking about whether people should have done more," said Shubert, the Buffalo attorney who knew her for nearly 40 years. "I think that's why her death is so hard. She died feeling like there was no one in her life, no one who cared. There's nothing sadder than that.
"And at the same time, it seems like that's what she wanted. How do you reconcile that?"
So maybe Lucie McNulty lived -- and died -- exactly the way she wanted.
But maybe not.
When police finally entered her house on Jan. 8, they noticed the electricity was still on. Lucie had set up automatic payments, so even though she had been dead for more than two years, there was never a reason to have the power shut off.
Two things were on in the house: the ceiling fan in the living room and a laptop computer on a small table.
On the computer screen was a Web browser opened to the travel site Expedia. It was a confirmation and reservation for a trip to Hawaii for Dec. 7, 2013.

Full text:   Agricultural Trades Show provides networking opportunity
AUGUSTA -- Anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 people will make their way through the Maine Agricultural Trades Show this week, and it's possible that among them are prospective customers for Joel Davis and Central Maine Meats.
As a relatively new player in the market, the facility is working to raise its profile across Maine. Customer by customer, the company is increasing its reach into the agricultural community, and it's hiring to meet those needs.
"We're growing very nicely," Davis, managing director for Central Maine Meats, said Tuesday.
In late December, company officials received word from the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development that they had secured a $100,000 employee training grant through the Community Development Block Grant Program funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That's in addition to the $540,000 block grant awarded in the middle of last year to allow the company to expand its production more quickly and to add equipment for producing specialized products like sausage and smoked meats. That grant came with a job-creation requirement that obligates the company to hire 14 people with just more than half of them coming from low- to moderate-income levels.
"We have a vision of expanding in a controlled environment," Davis said.
Within the next week or so, the company's flash freezer will come on line, and workers are being trained to use it. With it, Davis said, Central Maine Meats will have the ability to flash freeze seafood, shellfish and even vegetables for its customers.
The company has also acquired a smoker, and later this year, after it's installed and the training on using it is completed, that will be operational.
Mark Brown may never be one of Davis' customers. Even so, on Tuesday he stopped by the Central Maine booth while making the rounds at the trades show to inquire about the operation.
For four decades, Brown and his wife, Connie, operated Longmeadows Farm in Benton. The farm, on the National Register of Historic Places, is now in the hands of their son, Xandy, and his wife, Sherry, but Brown said he keeps his hand in by helping out during summers.
For years, they have used the same slaughterhouse, and they are satisfied with it. But he said he can see the opportunity for Central Maine Meats in the marketplace.
"You used to be able to get in whenever you wanted," Brown said. "Now, the slaughterhouses are booked up for years." It can take months to get on a schedule, he said.
Central Maine Meats is not quite at that point, Davis said, but the schedule is filling up.
For Davis, the business is about maximizing opportunities and finding markets for new products, like cowhides and possibly sheepskins, which are byproducts of the slaughtering facility in addition to providing quality cuts of meat.
"We have a customer who sells lamb to high-end restaurants in Boston and New York City," he said. "She's familiar with the needs of the chefs in terms of the cuts of meat they are looking for, and she has been in to show our cutters those cuts."
Because the facility is U.S. Department of Agriculture inspected, it's allowed to sell meat across state lines.
"To me, the most interesting piece is the local food strategy has been on the city's radar for a while," Patrick Wright, economic and community development coordinator for the city of Gardiner, said. "We're in proximity to farms and distribution networks and population centers, and doesn't it make sense to be a food hub? This is a realization of that goal, and we're excited to facilitate that expansion. We're hoping Central Maine Meats can represent a cluster of food related businesses, particularly helped by being in a cluster because there are similar needs for infrastructure and distribution."
The Maine Agricultural Trades Show continues through Thursday at the Augusta Civic Center.

Abstract: Oyster farmer Abigail Carroll straddles her boat motor as if she were getting on a seesaw -- apologizing over her shoulder for how goofy it might look -- lowers her weight onto it and sinks into a deep squat, demonstrating how she uses her body to lift the propeller out of the water. January, when everyone you know is making health and body-related resolutions, signing up for Weight Watchers or gym memberships, is also when most farmers have some time on their hands to address the aches and pains that accumulated during the last growing season. Or it might mean working with free programs like Maine AgrAbility, a USDA-funded program that helps those in agriculture with disabilities, chronic health conditions or simply aging-related issues.

Full text:   CARBOROUGH -- Oyster farmer Abigail Carroll straddles her boat motor as if she were getting on a seesaw -- apologizing over her shoulder for how goofy it might look -- lowers her weight onto it and sinks into a deep squat, demonstrating how she uses her body to lift the propeller out of the water.
It might not be macho marine, but this is the new way she handles the motor. The old way, bending over it and using her hands and arms to lift the heavy machinery, is what got her in trouble in the first place. Last spring she was trying to yank the weight up and out of the water and the cowling (cover) came away in her hands, sending her tumbling. She landed hard on the hull, striking the bottom of her spine. "I went flying," she said ruefully. "I was out for a week."
The injury was muscular but it stayed with her for the summer as she hoisted one heavy dragger and/or crate full of oysters after another out of the water of Scarborough Marsh; and in the fall, after getting the flu, she was in such rough shape that a friend sent her to his physical therapist, Kenneth Simons. He came out to her 6.8-acre farm and watched Carroll and the rest of Nonesuch Oysters' harvesters at work.
Simons has worked with a lot of home gardeners who injure themselves while tugging on something like weeds that releases suddenly and send them backwards. And he's worked with people who do a lot of lifting in warehouses. But he observed that the oyster farmers' set-up of lifting heavy loads is particularly hard on the back. "The classic example is lifting from the floor or from pallets," he said. "But it is never below your feet the way they are. Not to mention, their floor is moving." Simons came up with a list of exercises and equipment adjustments, suggestions which Carroll eagerly incorporated into her work days. "I feel like I'm trying to do things differently," she said.
"Part of it is just being mindful," she added, "thinking about where your center of gravity is."
This seems to be the way of today's new farmers. Don't just grin and bear it; repair it. Working a farm, whether on land or on sea, is repetitive and draining work. January, when everyone you know is making health and body-related resolutions, signing up for Weight Watchers or gym memberships, is also when most farmers have some time on their hands to address the aches and pains that accumulated during the last growing season.
That could entail physical therapy, like the kind Simons practices (he's got a lobsterman on his list of patients now as well). Or it might mean working with free programs like Maine AgrAbility, a USDA-funded program that helps those in agriculture with disabilities, chronic health conditions or simply aging-related issues.
Ellen Gibson, who works with the Maine AgrAbility Program, said they've made about 75 visits to Maine farms since the program started in 2010. When Gibson visits a farm for an assessment, she typically brings an occupational therapist, who she says "has the most amazing sense of what people need to be doing to make it easier on their entire body."
Maine AgrAbility has also reached hundreds more farmers, woodsmen and ocean harvesters through public presentations, she said, including at the Common Ground Fair. Even the younger farmers she sees there are complaining about the aches and pains left over from a summer of hard work.
Sometimes the advice she passes on is something as basic as don't jump off the tractor, climb off it. It's not always received well.
There's definitely a macho aspect to it," Gibson said. "Older farmers will just look at me and roll their eyes and say, 'Pain is what I live with.' And it's like, you really don't have to."
But given how much the local food movement focuses on organics and healthy living, it's perhaps unsurprising that many of these efforts fall within the holistic healing world.
"I haven't needed physical therapy," said Milkweed Farm's Lucretia Woodruff. "I have tried to stay ahead of that. I have thought, 'Whoa, farming really is hard on your body.' But I have had acupuncture, which does seem to help."
She's also a yoga practitioner and teacher -- she has taught classes at Bowdoin College for 12 years -- and uses yoga both in and off the fields, stretching out before and after a work session. "I am usually just so busy when I am farming that I am doing just that. But I try to really think about my alignment when I am squatting or kneeling."
Milkweed apprentices are likely to get an impromptu yoga lesson in the field from Woodruff in the form of an adjustment if she sees them doing something harmful. That's the informal class. But in Kittery, Erin Ehlers has actually taught a class called "Yoga for Farmers" four times in the last few years at the Yoga on the Hill studio. The classes have averaged seven to 10 pupils, whom she described as mostly farmers but also landscapers and dedicated home gardeners. She'll be teaching it again this March (check her website, yogaonthehillkittery.com, for schedules).
"Winter is a good time for farmers to recommit to self-care practices like yoga," Ehlers wrote in an email. "Yoga can help prepare farmers (and gardeners and stonemasons and landscapers and construction workers) by keeping the body balanced and strong before spring arrives."
Ehlers is married to an organic vegetable farmer, and she spent two years working as a cheesemaker on a dairy farm, so she knows of what she speaks. "Yoga makes sure that the bad habits of hunching to lift crates or squatting without being aware of body mechanics are replaced by better habits, better posture and improved full-body strength."
Throughout these recent dark mornings of winter, a group of farmers from Whitefield have been carpooling to a 5:30 a.m. class at a studio in Wiscasset. Ben Marcus, who farms and runs the Sheepscot General Store at Unca's Farm in Whitefield with his wife, Taryn Hammer, is part of that carpool, along with Jessie Dowling, of Fuzzy Udder Creamery.
Yoga is something Marcus had done periodically over the years but not consistently. Now he's intent on getting the most out of a 30-day trial at a studio in Wiscasset, including that 5:30 a.m. class.
"That's hard-core, right?" Marcus said.
The classes and treatments carry over, a healthy body memory to remind him how to work smart. "It has to do with how you carry yourself during the day and paying attention to the ergonomics of what you are doing," Marcus said.
Home gardeners can get in on the wellness action as well. The Brunswick Topsham Land Trust is offering a class called "Gardening without Aches and Pains" on Feb. 21, taught by Gibson of the Maine AgrAbility Program (she's also offered "Gardening Forever"). In Norway, Katey Branch of Halls Pond Healing Arts and Scott Vlaun, the director of the Center for an Ecology-Based Economy, team up for occasional yoga workshops in the community garden downtown.
"It's a natural fit," Vlaun said. "Especially with people like the new generation of farmers that are realizing they are going to be working a lot more with their bodies."
Making small adjustments to the way one moves in the field might seem simple, but Vlaun said it can change the whole nature of the action. "Then the work becomes more like back-building, not back-breaking, labor. If you are doing your yoga in the off-season, not only do you have all this fitness and flexibility, you also have a better understanding of how you use your body. Maybe you find yourself in warrior pose while you are hoeing."
"I feel like we could just leave the gym and the yoga studio behind and so much of our exercise and fitness could come from growing food," Vlaun added.
For someone like Carroll, who says she wishes she still had time for yoga, that's unlikely to happen. Instead she'll do Simons' exercises and rejigger her equipment as needed, like heightening the davit she uses to lift her oyster dragger onto the boat so that it lands on her sorting table instead of below it.
Then in the summer, she'll harvest in a wet suit and snorkel mask, moving through the water in the gentlest way she knows how. This gets her a big thumbs-up from Simons. "That would be a much better position," he said. "She would be basically laid out in a comfortable position, and supported by the buoyancy of the water."
Back-saving, in other words.
"Bending the back is the issue for most farmers," Simons said. "And all of the material-handling kinds of issues, lifting totes or whatever they are moving their product in."
The daily grind of "the lifting and being stressed out and making sure everything is OK and running a farm" brought Marcus not just to yoga but to acupuncture.
"I got turned on to it from another farming friend of mine who had major lower back issues," Marcus said. One of his CSA customers was an acupuncturist, and they arranged a barter.
"She puts needles in me," Marcus said. "I go to another place and then she comes back in like a half-hour later and basically wakes me up. And I feel like I just woke up from the best eight-hour sleep I ever had."
He goes in the evening almost once a month in the summertime, during high-stress season. "It's more a preventative health-care measure than anything," he said.
The classic Maine way of winding down from a hard day on the land -- or the road, or at the mill -- might traditionally have involved a beer and a cigarette, but these younger Maine farmers want to take a different route, trying to preserve their strength and flexibility for long-term lives on the land.
"It is a piece of the puzzle for sure," Marcus said.
At the Sheepscot General Store, he and Hammer have hosted yoga classes as well, but Marcus is aware of how that bucks tradition -- farmers putting on yoga classes. "You know how people are," Marcus said.
"All this holistic medicine," he said. "It all carries this stigma with it."
Unless you're open to it. In which case, between ergonomics, needles and namastes, the harvest might be a lot happier.

Full text:   C ompared to many parts of the world, the United States remains a very rich nation. One consequence is that most of us have a lot of stuff, and at this season of the year, most of us are about to have even more. Stuff that takes finite resources to make, to reach you, to wrap, to operate and eventually to throw out. Stuff we may not even want. Consider a gift that pleases the recipient, but also helps local farmers, the local economy and our stressed-out planet. Here are a few suggestions.
Everyone wants to belong, and we know a lot of Mainers who want to be part of making Maine a better, more sustainable place to live. But we're willing to bet that for every person who says, "I joined MOFGA, Maine Huts and Trails, or Maine Farmland Trust," there are 10 more saying, "I should really join MOFGA or Maine Huts and Trails, or Maine Farmland Trust" and leaving it at that. Just do it for them and slip the membership card into their stocking.
[bullet] MOFGA: The grand poobah of everything organic and sustainable is also a powerful lobbying force. $40 for individual, $60 for a family and $20 "seedling" membership for students, seniors and others who need it.
[bullet] BICYCLE COALITION OF MAINE: The advocacy group fights to keep cyclists around the state safe. Memberships start at $10 for students.
[bullet] MAINE FARMLAND TRUST: Does someone on your list drive a car with bumper stickers that say stuff like "No farms, no food"? Connect them to an organization that protects farmland, supports farmers and advances farming. The Trust also puts on some pretty cool art exhibits. Membership levels range from $20 (basic) to $1,000 (life).
[bullet] MAINE HUTS AND TRAILS: Open the door to year-round wilderness exploration. Membership speeds up the reservation process, gets you MH&T kayaks and canoes for free and helps enhance the miles and miles of trails winding through the Kingfield/Carrabassett Valley Region. (They do gift certificates too.)
[bullet] PORTLAND TOOL LIBRARY: For $50, your friend or family member gains access to tools from A (air hose splitter) to at least V (portable vise) without having to buy them. OK, OK, it's not romantic. But so useful.
[bullet] MAINE AUDUBON SOCIETY: Memberships start at $35 and will allow the birder in your life to participate in discounted trips and give them access to statewide Audubon nature centers and sanctuaries.
[bullet] PORTLAND FOOD CO-OP: Give them a fantastic grocery store. Or at least make them a part-owner in it. $100 gets them access to sale days and specials, and discounted classes, plus it gives them a voice in the Co-op.
[bullet] SUSTAINABLE SKI BUM: Try giving your loved ones tickets, or even a season pass, to one of the farms that transforms its fields into cross-country skiing and/or snowshoe trails in the winter. Remind them that the more they use this pass, the more money they'll be saving (few things motivate a Mainer better than a good value) and the more exercise and fresh air they'll be getting.
Harris Farm, a 500-acre dairy and vegetable in Dayton offers an individual season pass for $100, a youth pass for $60 (harrisfarm.com). The cows can also keep an eye on you at Pineland Farms in New Gloucester where season passes are $110 for adults, $90 for youth under 18 and seniors (pinelandfarms.org/outdoors-recreation/skiing.html). If you huff it to the highest point on the trails at Five Field Farms in South Bridgton, you'll see Mount Washington on a clear day. Adult one-day pass $12, youth $10 (fivefieldsski.com)
[bullet] FANCY FEAST: We all need a carrot on a string to help us get through winter, so wrap up a reservation for the height of summer. Barn dinners don't get any more alluring than the one Nebo Lodge offers on Thursday nights in the summer and for the first two Saturdays in September. For $95, adults get a roundtrip boat ride from Rockland to North Haven, where the barn doors at Turner Farm will be thrown open for seasonal cocktails and five-course family-style dinners featuring farm-raised pigs, cheeses and
vegetables. Also, drinks. But not for the under-21 set, who get to eat for $65. Call Nebo at 867-2007 for a reservation or email reservations@nebolodge.com.
[bullet] FARM STAY: Do you have a family member who needs to get away from it all? Wrest his iPhone from his hand and send him on a farm stay. They dot the map of Maine, but we like the look of Pagett Farm, a 63-acre organic farm in Palermo, with pasture-raised chickens, turkey, geese and pork. They promise big breakfasts with farm eggs and maple syrup, and accommodations include a "Tent on the Pond" (glamping starting at $149 a night) from April 15 to Oct. 15 or a yurt year-round (starting at $164). Visit paggetfarm.com for more information, call 993-2500 or email info@paggettfarm.com.

[bullet] TURN TURN TURN: If someone on your list loves working with her hands and dreams of turning a raw piece of wood into a beautiful wooden bowl, buy her a spot in the Jan. 16 Introduction and Demonstration of Wood Turning class at the Shelter Institute (www.shelterinstitute.com/home) in Woolwich. The three-hour class, taught by Ken Hatridge of Tree Trunk Designs, costs $45.
[bullet] FOREST-TO-FORK: The Maine Primitive Skills School in Augusta is offering a weekend-long spring foraging class (www.primitiveskills.com/course/spring-foraging-2) May 20-22 for $210. Your giftee will learn how to identify plant foods and medicines, harvest them responsibly, and then use them in meals, tinctures and salves. And if you're lucky, you could get a hand-foraged salve or a hand-picked dinner invitation in return.
[bullet] WHO ON YOUR LIST KNEADS THIS? The baker in your family would be thrilled to get a pass to the 2016 Kneading Conference (kneadingconference.com/about-the-kneading-conference-3) sponsored by the Maine Grain Alliance. Each year, breadheads from all over the country descend on the Skowhegan fairgrounds to learn new skills. Next year's dates are July 28-29, and the keynote speaker is Amy Halloran, author of "The New Bread Basket: How the new crop of grain growers, plant breeders, millers, maltsers, bakers, brewers, and local food activists are redefining our daily loaf." The registration fee is $325 and includes meals.
[bullet] "THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING: Capitalism vs. the Climate" by Naomi Klein. Released in paperback this August, Klein's much-talked-about book issues a call to humankind to address climate change through restructuring the global economy.
[bullet] "PROJECT PUFFIN: The Improbable Quest to Bring a Beloved Seabird Back to Egg Rock" by Stephen W. Kress and Derrick Z. Jackson. From our own backyard, a quasi-memoir about Kress' decades-long quest to bring puffins back to Egg Rock in the Gulf of Maine, where they hadn't been seen since 1885. Because everyone needs a feel-good story about sustainability and wicked cute birds.
[bullet] "THE THIRD PLATE: Field Notes on the Future of Food" by Dan Barber. Now in paperback, the bestseller from the famed New York chef is a roadmap to a "whole farm" way to eat sustainably, drawn from Barber's frustrations over how the fanatic pursuit of specialized ingredients for farm-to-table cuisine sometimes prioritizes ingredients over smarter ecological choices.
If none of these grab your fancy, grab a gift certificate from one of Maine's many independent booksellers, including Gulf of Maine in Brunswick, Longfellow Books in Portland, Sherman's Books & Stationery (in Bar Harbor, Boothbay Harbor, Camden, Freeport and Portland), Maine Coast Book Shop & Cafe in Damariscotta or Hello Hello Books in Rockland.

[bullet] GREEN GROOMING: We think we've figured out the secret to Santa's flourishing white beard - the beard oils (www.portlandgeneralstore.com/collections/beardcare) made in small batches of organic ingredients at the Portland General Store. Alright, maybe Santa just has good genes, but they certainly would make great stocking stuffers for the farmer -- or grandpa -- in your life. They smell good: The manly man scents include tobacco, ginger, whiskey and even black fly, which does double duty as an insect repellent. They also moisturize. The 15-milliliter glass bottles with dropper sell for $30 each. Sampler boxes are also available.
[bullet] TOASTS FOR THE LOCAVORE: Set your loved ones up for the New Year with a Champagne Cocktail Starter Kit from Royal Rose, a Brunswick-based company that makes small-batch cocktail syrups with organic and fairly traded ingredients. The kit includes one bottle each of raspberry and anise simple syrups. Use vodka for a raspberry sparkler (recipes are included), or dark rum or spiced rum for an anise sparkler. The kit costs $26.
[bullet] A TOKEN OF YOUR AFFECTION: Buy a handful of wooden tokens from the Portland Farmers' Market -- they come in $1 and $5 denominations. You don't even need to tuck them into a festive bag or box because that's done for you. The next time the recipient shops at the market, she'll be able to pick up that strange and pricey organic vegetable she's been pining to try.
[bullet] TRASH TO TREASURE: It may sound more like a gag gift (literally) than a Christmas gift, but a year's worth of compost is the gift that keeps on giving throughout the summer. Curbside composting companies take your stinky (organic) garbage, compost it, and return it to you to use in your garden. Garbage to Garden (garbagetogarden.org) is running a special right now for $154 per year, or $12.83 per month. Another southern Maine company, We Compost It (www.wecompostit.com/portland.html)offers a monthly subscription for $8.99.
Community-supported agriculture programs are abundant in Maine, and the more popular they become the more creative they get. These three unconventional CSAs are sure to put a smile on someone's face Christmas morning.

[bullet] WINNEGANCE OYSTER FARM won't officially launch its oyster CSA until 2016, but the West Bath oyster farm is accepting a limited number of pre-orders for CSA memberships for the holiday season. Shares cost $150 for 10 dozen oysters delivered over the May to November season. They can be picked up weekly, on Friday nights and Saturday mornings, at the Winnegance oyster stand on Essex Street in Portland. Email orders@winneganceoysterfarm.com.
[bullet] Help someone you love keep warm with a comforting mushroom soup this winter, made with mushrooms from the NORTH SPORE (www.northspore.com) WINTER MUSHROOM CSA. The CSA -- $200 for a half share and $300 for a whole share -- starts in January and ends in early May. Half-share members get a half pound of fresh mushrooms every week, and full share members get a full pound. Add $60 to your gift for medicinal mushroom products, such as a tin of chaga tea. All memberships come with a mushroom cookbook, a grow-at-home kit and a North Spore T-shirt. northspore.com.
[bullet] Just last week, Gelato Fiasco launched the state's first (as far as we know) ice cream CSA. Called COLD TREATS SENT AUTOMATICALLY -- or C(t)SA -- this pints subscription program ships gelato and sorbetto right to the member's door, four times a year. The four pints in each shipment are chosen by the founders of Gelato Fiasco, and they come with a handmade wooden gelato spoon made by Brunswick-based woodcarver Jason Weymouth. A membership costs $199, which includes shipping to most East Coast addresses. OK, we freely admit that this isn't a CSA in the true meaning of the concept -- in which you pay a local farmer upfront, typically in winter when they are generating little to no income yet must buy seeds, to help spread the high risks of farming; the benefits -- in the form of veggies -- come months later. But hey, it's Christmas, Mr. Grinch. Is anyone going to argue with delicious ice cream delivered to her door? shop.gelatofiasco.com.
Every week in Source, we bring you stories of Maine-made products that are made from sustainable resources and leave out all the bad stuff. Here are a few of our favorites that are small enough to fit in a stocking:

Full text:   I've lived on North Haven Island in Penobscot Bay for more than 40 years now. In my recent conversations there with lobstermen and others who work on the water -- on North Haven and up and down the coast -- one thing has become abundantly clear: The ocean that they and so many others in Maine depend on for their living isn't the same as it was even 10 years ago.
I commend Press Herald staff writer Colin Woodard for his thorough coverage of the many ways climate change is negatively affecting the Gulf of Maine -- among them, the shifting habitat of vital species, the boom of invasive species and rising water temperatures that make it more difficult for pressured populations such as cod to rebound. All of these issues have come together in a perfect storm of sorts to threaten the marine biodiversity that Maine's coastal economy has been built on.
I'm working in Washington to raise alarm bells on these dire threats to the future of our coastal communities. I invite any of my colleagues who continue to ignore the realities of climate change to come to Maine to see it in action and talk to the men and women it's already affecting.
In particular, I've tried to bring federal attention to one effect of climate change that isn't as visible as others -- ocean acidification.
As more carbon dioxide has been released into the atmosphere, oceans have absorbed much of it, with Maine's cold waters making an especially good sponge. Along with increased runoff from extreme weather and precipitation, oceans have become 30 percent more acidic since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and models predict that pace to quicken sharply.
The changing makeup of the water has a devastating impact on a number of marine species, but especially shellfish. The acidic water makes it more difficult for mussels, oysters and clams, among others, to develop strong shells, leading to higher rates of mortality and decreased numbers.
Though these effects have been well documented, there is a severe lack of information about ocean acidification and a number of questions without clear answers. Two of the biggest I have are: How does ocean acidification affect lobster populations? What can our communities do to prepare and mitigate the effects?
It's no secret why the first question would be important here in Maine. As the populations of other kinds of fish have declined, our economy has become increasingly dependent on one species. Lobsters currently make up about 69 percent of our commercial fishing catch, so it's imperative that we investigate how ocean acidification may affect their health.
But we already know that ocean acidification negatively affects other shellfish species that make significant contributions to our economy. The question then becomes: How should we be helping our communities deal with these impacts now and in the future?
As we turn to face the more visible effects of climate change, we simply can't afford to be blindsided by ocean acidification. To that end, I've introduced federal legislation -- H.R. 2553, the Coastal Communities Acidification Act of 2015 -- to try to find answers to these and other questions.
The bill would require the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to identify which communities are most dependent on the ocean and study how acidification would affect them if valuable industries such as lobster harvesting were affected. I'm proud that 30 of my colleagues, including nine Republicans, have signed on in support of the bill.
I applaud the leadership of the Maine Legislature in creating a commission to study ocean acidification in Maine. A report that the group released earlier this year notes, "Perhaps the most alarming of the commission's findings is how much we do not know about ocean acidification and how it will affect Maine's commercially important species, including the iconic lobster."
I completely agree. While I hope the state will move forward in addressing this report's recommendations, I think the federal government also should do its part in closing the knowledge gap. This is a national problem, and one Maine shouldn't have to deal with alone.
Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, represents Maine's 1st District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Good and bad news about climate change

Abstract: Bad news first. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, burning fossil fuels has increased the level of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, in our atmosphere.

Links: http://CX2EF4JW8J.search.serialssolutions.com/directLink?&amp;atitle=Good+and+bad+news+about+climate+change&amp;author=&amp;issn=&amp;title=Morning+Sentinel&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;date=2015-11-07&amp;spage=1.A&amp;id=doi:&amp;sid=ProQ_ss&amp;genre=article

Full text:   There is much disturbing news about climate change, but there is also good news. This tells both.
Bad news first. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, burning fossil fuels has increased the level of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, in our atmosphere. In effect, we have covered the Earth with an atmospheric blanket of greenhouse gases. Current concentrations of carbon dioxide are higher than at any time in the entire history of humans on Earth.
The oceans are absorbing about half of this increased carbon dioxide, making ocean water more acidic, which is beginning to seriously affect our shellfish industry, as detailed recently by Colin Woodard of the Portland Press Herald.
The really bad news is that there is a real and dangerous probability that one or more climate disruptions (scientists refer to them as tipping points) will come into play and accelerate climate warming if we take no action to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The major result would be a rapid rise in both sea levels and the associated costs of dealing with such a catastrophe.
A July 23 Department of Defense report to Congress begins, "Climate change ... is an urgent and growing threat to our national security, contributing to increased natural disasters, refugee flows and conflicts over basic resources such as food and water.
"These impacts are already occurring, and the scope, scale and intensity of these impacts are projected to increase over time."
It's not just climate scientists and climate activists who see the bad news. Many conservatives recognize that the risks to the climate and our national security require action but dislike the government regulatory actions that have been the only option so far since the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the risks fall under the Clean Air Act.
Now for the good news.
It's not too late to reverse the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases with a bold legislative solution that both political parties can embrace. The policy, called Carbon Fee and Dividend, creates many new jobs as it builds a new economy with alternative energy.
Carbon Fee and Dividend was developed by George Schultz, President Ronald Reagan's secretary of the Treasury and is being put before Congress by Citizens Climate Lobby. It is a market-based solution that corrects the failure of the market to properly assign the costs to society of burning fossil fuels. Costs such as:
[bullet] Extra flood disaster costs faced by FEMA.
[bullet] Health care costs of air pollution and increasing heat stress.
[bullet] Disruptions in agriculture caused by unpredictable weather.
[bullet] Changes in fisheries caused by ocean warming and acidification.
Under Carbon Fee and Dividend, companies that extract fossil fuels will pay a fee at the source (the coal mine, oil or gas well, or port of entry). This fee would start at $15 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions, and increase steadily each year so that clean energy will be cheaper than fossil fuels within a decade.
All of the money collected from the carbon fee will be returned to American households on an equal basis. About two-thirds of all households would break even or receive more in their dividend checks than they would pay in higher prices due to the fee. This would protect the poor and middle class.
On the side of industry, a predictably increasing carbon price will send a clear market signal to entrepreneurs, businesses and homeowners to invest in the new clean-energy economy. There is also a border adjustment to protect U.S. companies from imports originating in countries that don't have a similar economic plan to control carbon dioxide emissions.
A 2014 study by Regional Economic Models Inc. found that Carbon Fee and Dividend would save hundreds of thousands of lives over 20 years while cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half, building the economy and adding 2.8 million new jobs.
Carbon Fee and Dividend legislation will put us on the path to a sustainable climate by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning us to a clean energy economy.
I invite interested people to join efforts to persuade members of Congress by writing to their representatives and senators.

Full text:   Backing needed for bills to boost data on shoring up gulf ecosystem
Last of six parts
AUGUSTA -- When the Maine Legislature's commission on ocean acidification reported its findings -- that the state's fisheries and aquaculture industries were threatened by this baleful byproduct of global warming -- officials here were not exactly spurred to action.
Acidification, driven by increased carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and freshwater runoff from extreme rainfall in river basins, has been implicated in failures at oyster hatcheries and mussel farms and has been shown to weaken clams and other shell-building animals vital to Maine's fishing and aquaculture industries. But bills introduced by lawmakers in the last session -- one each by a Democratic marine scientist and a Republican lobsterman -- to implement many of the panel's findings were withdrawn, one for lack of resources, the other for lack of support from Gov. Paul LePage's administration.
"I could see the bill wasn't going to go anywhere and that the governor was going to veto it," Rep. Mick Devin, a Democrat from Newcastle, says of legislation he sponsored to allow the commission to continue its work for another three years.
Patricia Aho, who was the commissioner of environmental protection until she resigned in August, opposed Devin's bill, saying the status quo was sufficient. "Since the issues of climate change and ocean acidification are inextricably linked, we think it will be more efficient to consider this issue in the broader context of climate change and adaptation programs," she said in written testimony to legislators.
Devin's bill and another one sponsored by Rep. Wayne Parry, a Republican from Arundel, were carried over to the next legislative session. Parry's bill would have put a bond issue on the ballot that would borrow $3 million to fund several of the expert committee's recommendations: collecting data, monitoring waterways and performing tests in coastal waters to better assess the effect of acidification on wildlife and commercial fish species. It was withdrawn after failing to make it to the top of an informal list of bonding priorities drawn up by legislative leaders.

The Gulf of Maine has been warming at a rate faster than nearly anywhere else on the planet, and water temperature in 2012 was the highest in the century and a half that readings have been collected. The effects, including the retreat of native species, the spread of invaders from more southern climes and the acidification of seawater, have been substantial and are expected to be more so in the future as long-term warming trends make the 2012-like temperature the "new normal" by mid-century.
Experts say there's little that Maine or New England can do by itself to address the underlying issue: the continued warming of the Earth because of greenhouse gas emissions from factories, cars, power plants, livestock feedlots and other human activities. Maine produces just 0.32 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which works out to about 0.05 percent of those in the world.
But Mainers could mitigate the damage by shoring up the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, reducing other stresses we can control and learning ways to protect resources from some of the worst effects.
"We have to pay attention to the factors we can exert some control over and try to identify ones that would produce the best possible return, the best bang for your buck," says Katherine Mills, a fisheries ecologist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland who has studied the effect of warming sea temperature on salmon and other species.
"If we limit pollution, if we reduce excess nutrients in our rivers, if we ensure the coastal habitats to be as robust as they can be, that's going to help the system to be resilient," says Matt Abbott, the Fundy Baykeeper at the Conservation Council of New Brunswick, an environmental group. "Even if we don't know exactly what is going to happen, we know changes are occurring and that the system needs to be as robust as it can."
At a local level, scientists believe, there are ways to mitigate the effects of one aspect of a warming gulf: ocean acidification.
Eelgrasses and kelps take up dissolved carbon dioxide at a remarkable rate -- with almost triple the effectiveness of a similar acreage of forest -- and consume excess nutrients, the two primary drivers of acidification. In doing so, they reduce the acidity of the surrounding seawater to the benefit of clams, mussels and other creatures living nearby.
The Rockland-based Island Institute, a nonprofit that supports coastal communities, is partnering with a commercial kelp farm off Chebeague Island and scientists at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay to find out how effective and widespread these benefits can be. This winter -- the growing season for kelp -- they'll deploy monitoring equipment around one of Ocean Approved Inc.'s first-in-the-nation open-ocean commercial kelp farms. (Disclosure: this reporter is a Bigelow trustee.)
"You may very well be able to improve the growing conditions for shellfish on a very local level by locating a kelp farm with shellfish," says Suzie Arnold, the marine scientist at the Island Institute who is collaborating on the effort. Kelp, she says, could become "the new kale," a nutritious food source, while improving the environment, the survival of shellfish and the winter employment opportunities in fishing communities.
Eighty-seven percent of the value of Maine's $585 million commercial fish catch comes from shell-building creatures, including lobsters, clams, scallops and oysters. The federal government estimates the industry supports 33,000 jobs in Maine, roughly half of them ashore.
Those on the front lines of acidification are frustrated that the state government isn't doing more.
"Maine's resource industries are what defines the state, and it totals up to a lot of money," says Bill Mook. The founder of Mook Sea Farms, he watched acidic water devastate crops of newly hatched oysters. "It boggles my mind that as a state we wouldn't act on bills that would give us some idea of what businesspeople like me will be facing."
The ocean acidification commission, a panel of scientists, fishermen, aquaculturists and legislators, studied the problem and issued a range of recommendations, many of them focused on the collection of data that will help assess more precisely what the effects are and will be on key species. The "most alarming" finding, their 122-page report stated, was "how much we do not know about ocean acidification and how it will affect Maine's commercially important species."
"We're far more dependent than at any other time on lobsters, for instance, but we don't know what the pH is in the important coastal regions where the juvenile stages of development and settlement of lobsters occur and how it affects their survival," says Sen. Chris Johnson, D-Somerville, who co-chaired the commission with Devin. "We can't wait until we have a collapse of an economically important species for our industry. We need to be working now on how to test mitigation strategies and build our monitoring."
Parry, the lobsterman legislator who sponsored the acidification monitoring bond, agrees. "The biggest thing we learned on the commission was that we don't have enough data," he says. "I'm normally not a bond person, but we need to be able to get the equipment so that we can have continuous, real-time monitoring so we can determine what is what. It's very important for the survival of all Maine fisheries."
The DEP, asked to substantiate why it believes existing programs are sufficient to deal with the problem, sent the Press Herald a five-page summary of its programs that touch on climate change, including providing technical assistance for eelgrass restoration in Casco Bay, the routine collection of discharge data from polluters, participation in the acidification commission's meetings and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multi-state effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Asked to comment on the DEP summary, Johnson says, "It's suggesting that what we're doing already is good enough. That is not the case."
The administration, he said, left a number of key goals unaddressed, including identifying and reducing acidification-causing nutrient pollution from unpermitted sources, stepping up ocean chemistry monitoring, or creating a body that can coordinate the necessary work.
"None of the departments have stepped up to embrace the need for an entity that will move things forward so we don't just wait for something to happen," he says.
Devin, a marine laboratory manager and a Democratic legislator from Newcastle, says such an entity is vital. "Without a formal committee, none of this is going to be a priority," he says. "Our state government needs to take the lead on this, because we're not going to have a federal response on this at this time."
The state of Washington has taken the lead in confronting ocean acidification, which threatens its $270 million shellfish industry. Its blue-ribbon panel released findings in November 2012 that helped inform the Maine commission's study. The day it released the report, Gov. Chris Gregoire ordered state agencies to take steps to implement it and called for increased investments in scientific research and efforts to curb nutrient-laden runoff.
California convened its own ocean acidification panel in 2012, which has since been joined by the governments of Oregon, Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia and is now a vehicle to study the problem and build political momentum to address the issue up and down the West Coast.
Maine DEP spokesman David Madore said the administration also has made steps to address other aspects of climate change, highlighting the work of the Environmental and Energy Resources Working Group, an interagency panel convened by LePage and chaired by Aho. That group issued a report in September 2014 recommending its work should be continued to coordinate action and the implementation of 31 other specific recommendations, four of which appear to bear directly on climate change effects on the gulf.
More than a year later, however, the group has not reconvened. Madore said Aho "had a timetable to restart and expand the working group" beginning this fall or winter, but that those plans had been put on hold after her departure last month. Acting commissioner Avery Day is "aware of the importance of this work going forward," but "has not formalized any schedule for implementation."
Two of the four actions directly related to the gulf -- the development of a $26.9 million bond issue to repair, replace and upgrade failed septic systems and commercial discharge practices, and the creation of new water runoff models for the state -- will be acted on once the group reconvenes, Madore said. A third -- increasing stormwater assumptions in culvert replacement rules -- was implemented this August, he said, backed by $800,000 in grants to help pay for new projects.
The other directly relevant recommendation -- to assist fishermen in adapting to climate-induced changes in fish stocks -- falls under the Department of Marine Resources' jurisdiction. In a written response for information on how this was being implemented, a department spokesman cited the department's efforts to develop regulations for the fishing of black sea bass, its support for confronting the green crab explosion (including the fencing of clam flats and the convening of a summit on the issue), and the ongoing development of a long-term lobster fishery management plan.
The spokesman also said the department "remains committed to participating in ongoing discussions and supporting efforts by organizations that are targeting" ocean acidification.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat representing Maine's 1st District, has introduced federal legislation directing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the likely effects of acidification on individual coastal communities and identify gaps in knowledge. Her staff said the bill's short-term prospects were dim because the Republican leadership of the U.S. House had little enthusiasm for funding climate-related research.
"I'm really quite concerned about ocean acidification and its impact on the Gulf of Maine," Pingree said in a statement. "We need more information, more research and we need to be much better prepared."
Parry, the Republican state representative from Arundel, put it this way in his testimony: "We can say it's mostly from airborne CO2, but we here in Maine are not going to stop China and India from polluting."
"If there are things we can do here in Maine," he told legislators, "we should try."

Full text:   Researchers find decrease in pH stunts shellbuilders' development
Fifth of six parts
WALPOLE -- The baby mussels are thriving.
Two months ago they were near-invisible larvae, swimming around tanks of seawater in a refrigerated room at the Darling Marine Center. Now tens of thousands of the tiny mollusks, each just a few millimeters long, have attached themselves to the different kinds of rope scientists have been testing here, and are eating the lab's stock of algal food at an impressive clip.
Mick Devin, the lab manager at this University of Maine research facility, has been overseeing this experiment, part of an effort to master the art of hatching mussels, something mussel farmers -- who grow their product on lines hanging in seawater -- previously never have needed to do.
"Mussel farmers have been able to just throw their lines out and collect all the larvae they want from nature," Devin says. "But mussel populations are down drastically in this state, so that may not be working so well now." Hatcheries, he expects, may have to step up in the not-too-distant future.
Mussels have been vanishing from stretches of coastline where they once were ubiquitous, and scientists remain uncertain why. Green crabs, whose population exploded after an "ocean heat wave" in 2012, may have stripped many sections clean. But warmer water and increased rainfall -- both problems expected to grow in Maine as a result of global climate change -- may be creating a far worse problem: an acid sea.
"We know this affects larval development in bivalves, (and) chances are it will result in decreased numbers, whether it's a natural population on a bed or one in a farm," says Paul Rawson, of the University of Maine's School of Marine Sciences, who is in charge of the research. "We need to make sure the technology is in place so the farms will have a reliable source of seed."
'GROUND ZERO'
The world's oceans are turning more acidic. Since the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have grown by more than 70 percent and now stand at the highest level in at least 800,000 years. As the oceans absorb additional CO2, they've become 30 percent more acidic over this period. By 2050, scientists estimate, surface pH levels will be lower -- that is, more acidic -- than at any time in several million years and by 2100 more acidic than any time in the past 300 million years -- two or three times more so than today.
The Gulf of Maine is particularly vulnerable because its colder water more readily absorbs carbon dioxide and because the increasing frequency of major snow and rain events flood the gulf with more acidic river runoff. Monitoring buoys have recorded an increase in CO2 levels of about 1.25 parts per million -- or roughly 0.3 percent -- per year in the gulf since they were installed in 2007.
With climate models predicting a 9 percent to 14 percent increase in winter precipitation -- and more modest increases in spring and fall -- across Maine, New Hampshire and most of eastern Massachusetts in the middle decades of this century, the situation is expected to continue worsening faster than the global average, with serious effects on marine life and coastal communities.
"Maine is ground zero for North Atlantic acidification," says Mark Green, professor of marine science at St. Joseph's College in Standish. "It's happening, it's documented, but we don't know when the tipping point is going to be reached."
Maine's fisheries economy is also especially vulnerable, as it depends on species that may not thrive in a more acidic gulf. "Shellbuilders are the ones that will be impacted the most, and we have an overwhelming reliance on shellbuilding organisms," notes Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at the Island Institute in Rockland who studies the problem. Eighty-seven percent of the value of Maine's commercial fish catch comes from creatures that have shells, including lobsters, clams, scallops and oysters.
The effects of acidification on lobsters have barely been studied in colder water. The only published research -- a 2012 study from St. Francis Xavier University conducted on Nova Scotia's northern coast -- suggested that larvae exposed to acidic conditions were smaller and slower to develop, though scientists say more research is needed to really get a handle on the effect.
Most immediately affected are bivalves such as mussels, oysters and clams, which have a much harder time building their shells in more acidic conditions.
Bill Mook, owner of Mook Sea Farm just up the river from the Darling Center, started seeing mass die-offs of oyster larvae at his hatchery a decade ago, usually following a major storm, an increasingly frequent occurrence in Maine. "We'd see the swimming larvae develop normally for a week or two, and then they'd just stop feeding," he recalls. "At first we couldn't figure out what was happening."
Then in 2009 a visiting Oregon oyster farm owner described an ongoing disaster in that state's hatcheries, where production had fallen by 80 percent. The larvae, he told colleagues in Maine, turned out to be dying because the water was too acidic, making it much harder for them to build their first shells out of dissolved calcium carbonate in the surrounding seawater. The energy reserves from their eggs was running out before the larvae could develop their digestive organs and survive on their own.
Mook began testing the pH of the water entering the hatchery from the Damariscotta. After each storm it was way too high, and the level in between storms was going up as well. "When I started my business 30 years ago, the CO2 levels were at least 30 parts per million lower, so even during spring rains the carbonate conditions would remain OK," he says.
Now, with the background level higher, each major storm drove acidity conditions into the red. In a few decades, even the background level may be too high for spring larvae to survive.
Mook now treats the water coming into his hatchery to ensure proper pH levels are maintained, but he fears what it means for wild shellfish populations. "The real question here is what is happening to the mussel larvae," he says. "I predict the impact of ocean acidification is going to be first felt by the wild bivalve fisheries like clams and mussels and will be manifested by a failure of recruitment" -- the failure of the infants to survive and become adults.
The state's aquaculture industry is extremely concerned about acidification. "Make no mistake about it: What is at risk here is nothing short of the future of the aquaculture and fishing sectors of this state," Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, warned state legislators in June.
Belle knows of at least one instance when mussel farmers witnessed a different sort of failure. The larvae built their shells and grew into tiny mussels but couldn't attach themselves to ropes for some reason. This is particularly worrisome, because scientists at the University of Washington have found that acidification substantially reduces the strength of the threadlike material -- the byssus -- that mussels use to anchor themselves.
"We don't know enough about the physiological impacts of shifts of ocean pH on specific organisms," Belle says. "There's been a lot of talk about shellfish, but we've heard relatively little about the impact on larval finfish. What about cod and halibut larvae?" -- two species farmed in Maine. "Is there an impact on their ability to metamorphose and grow into juveniles?"
Researchers at Stony Brook University in New York also have established that high carbon dioxide levels in seawater kill many hard-shell clam larvae and weaken the shells of the juveniles that do survive, stunting their future growth even when CO2 levels returned to normal.
Jeff Clements, a doctoral student at the University of New Brunswick in Saint John, has been studying how juvenile soft-shell clams deal with another problem: muddy bottoms that have become more acidic. "If they are exposed to acidic sediments, they won't burrow into them," he says. "The juveniles let the tidal currents carry them around as they search for places where that's not a problem. Problem is, they're exposed to predators the whole time they do that."
With all of these challenges, Green, the St. Joseph's College professor, believes humans are going to have to learn to grow shellfish larvae into juveniles to maintain wild stocks. "Hatcheries are going to become so important, because wild populations are going to falter," he says. "Larval clams and mussels can't survive with the water chemistry changes that are going to come. There's no two ways about it."

Full text:   Fourth of six parts
BRUNSWICK -- Until two years ago, if you had walked down to the shore of Maquoit Bay at low tide, you would have seen a meadow of eelgrass stretching nearly as far as the eye could see across the exposed seafloor. Here near the head of the bay, the sea grass stretched for 2 miles to the opposite shore, creating a vast nursery for the shellfish and forage species of Casco Bay, of which Maquoit is a part.
Now there's only mud.
Green crabs took over the bay in the late fall of 2012 and the spring and summer of 2013, tearing up the eelgrass in their pursuit of prey and devouring almost every clam and mussel from here to Yarmouth. Fueled by record high water temperature in 2012 and a mild winter in 2013, the green crab population grew so huge that the mudflats of Casco Bay became cratered with their burrowing, and much of the Maquoit and adjacent Middle Bay bottom turned into a lunar landscape.
Eelgrass coverage in Maquoit Bay fell by 83 percent. With nothing rooted to the bottom, the seawater turned far muddier, making life hard on any plants or baby clams that tried to recolonize the bay.
"We were astounded," says Hilary Neckles, of the U.S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, who linked the destruction to the green crabs. "The ecological ramifications really reverberate throughout the ecosystem, because sea grass is the preferred habitat of so many fish and shellfish species."
Over the past decade, the Gulf of Maine has been one of the fastest-warming parts of the world's oceans, allowing warm-water intruders to gain a toehold and earlier invaders such as the green crab to take over. Coupled with declines of the cold-loving species that have dominated the gulf for thousands of years, the ecological effects of even more gradual long-term warming are expected to be serious, even as precise forecasting remains beyond the scope of current science.
Scientists say the 2012 "ocean heat wave" was an unusual event, and that the 10-year accelerated warming trend is likely part of an oceanographic cycle and unlikely to continue. But the gulf has been warming consistently for more than 30 years, and long-term forecasts project average sea surface temperature in our region could reach 2012-like levels by midcentury. The events of 2012 and the nearly as warm year that followed probably provide a preview of things to come, of a gulf radically transformed, with major implications for life on the Maine coast.
Genevieve MacDonald, who fishes for lobster out of Stonington, was standing on the dock at Isle au Haut one morning that summer, looked in the water and couldn't believe her eyes. There, swimming around the harbor like mackerel, were dozens and dozens of longfin squid, temperate creatures rarely seen in the chilly water of eastern Maine. "If you had a cast net, you could have brought in a whole basket full of squid," she recalls.
Since then, people from Brunswick to Bristol have been encountering gigantic beds of gelatinous, finger-shaped pods in shallow water at low tide, some measuring 4 feet across. Researchers from the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center ran across one in August 2014 in the Damariscotta River and, perplexed as to what they were, brought them back to the lab. A colleague recognized it at once: a longfin squid egg mass containing thousands of squirming embryos.
The squid, apparently, are intending to stick around, and MacDonald hopes they do, since they're the stuff of calamari. "Climate change is real, but it might also provide some new opportunities if we're careful," she says. "Lobstering is really lucrative, and I hope it stays that way; but if something happens, it would be nice to have a backup plan."
Marissa McMahan spent that notoriously warm summer of 2012 lobstering with her father out of Georgetown and encountered a different visitor, a large, stout gray-and-black fish she'd never seen before. The fish, which began turning up in lobster traps up and down the coast, was the black sea bass, a succulent mid-Atlantic species normally unable to tolerate Maine's cold sea.
Now a doctoral student at Northeastern University, McMahan is doing her dissertation on how black sea bass are spreading and interacting with lobster and other native species. "I don't see anything to immediately worry about, but I talk to a lot of fishermen south of Cape Cod who think sea bass have played a role in reducing lobster numbers there," she says. "They tend to open up the sea bass they catch, and they do have a lot of lobsters inside them."
"It's a very sought-after and marketable fish, so it could create an economic subsidy where we're pretty much dependent on one single fishery," McMahan adds. "But if there are all these other species moving north, we may have a lot more predators on lobsters."
Other invaders appear to have few upsides.
Larry Harris, of the University of New Hampshire, has been tracking the spread of an unpleasant Asian weed, the pancake batter tunicate, an ugly, bloblike sea squirt that grows in dense colonies that spread in sheets across the seafloor, smothering native creatures. "It can overgrow mussels and sponges and anemones and other species that provide food for predators," he says, noting that nothing here wants to eat it. "It's the tunicate from hell."
Brought to New England by shellfish farmers using Asian oysters, the tunicate used to die back each winter, but with the warmer water temperatures, it has expanded over large swaths of the bottom from Passamaquoddy Bay to Georges Bank, where Harris thinks its presence might be contributing to the failure of cod stocks.
Green crabs, a European species introduced to the East Coast in the mid-19th century, reached Maine in the late 1940s, when the gulf began experiencing a warming spike second only to the present one. Then, as now, the crabs' assault on soft-shell clams made newspaper headlines. "Green Killers March On," the Portland Evening Express warned in January 1952, reporting that "old-timers suggest extreme cold and heavy sheet ice ... were responsible for keeping them under control."
The gulf has seen cold and warm cycles since then, but with an ever warmer background trend, the green crabs appear to be doing more lasting damage.
With its 20-foot tides and miles of sheltered bottom, Cobscook Bay, a multi-chambered estuary in easternmost Maine, is to intertidal ecologists what the Amazon is to rainforest researchers, a place where whelks and periwinkles grow to Jurassic proportions. Animals that normally live below the low-tide mark -- accessible only by scuba or submarine -- live in the intertidal zone there and can be studied with no more than a pair of boots.
Carl Merrill, director of Suffolk University's field station in Edmunds, on the western end of the bay, has been studying Cobscook's shores for nearly 40 years. In his surveys, he used to find both the smooth and rough periwinkles in concentrations of hundreds to thousands of individuals per square meter. Now he gets dozens or fewer per square meter. "The decline is substantial and very obvious," he says. "Sometimes you don't find one."
The culprit isn't harvesters -- "wrinklers" collect the larger, non-native common periwinkle, which lives lower down the intertidal zone. "The green crab is the likely explanation," Merrill says. The crustaceans appear to be picking the shore clean of the little snails, with unknown ecological effects.
The crabs also appear to be stripping much of the coast of mussels. On shorelines that 20 or 30 years ago were carpeted with the bivalves -- taking up half the available space -- they now cover less than 10 percent. Water temperature and ocean acidification may be playing a role, but green crabs appear to be a large part of the picture, since wild larvae settle and grow just fine at mussel farms and on the undersides of buoys and other objects the crabs can't reach.
Brian Beal, a marine shellfish ecologist at the University of Maine at Machias, says it's likely not just green crabs, but also lobsters and even Asian shore crabs, another invasive species that's already become the dominant shore crab in seacoast New Hampshire. Together, he suspects, they're eating the juvenile mussels, which explains why the bivalve is found only in places crabs can't get to easily.
Warming also is responsible for the collapse of soft-shell clam populations in Freeport, Brunswick, Penobscot and other communities, Beal says. "As water temperature increases, we get a higher predation rate because most of the predators are invertebrates who are much more active in warm water," including milky ribbon worms, moon snails and, of course, the green crab, he adds.
To prove his point, in April 2014 Beal oversaw the placement of net-covered plots in Freeport's Harraseeket River, which were then seeded with juvenile clams. Seven months later, 90 percent of the seeded clams in all plots had survived, plus a staggering 1,400 wild clams per square foot were taking refuge under the nets, designed to stop green crabs from entering. "We estimated that close to 13 million wild clams settled into those 40 netted plots during that seven-month experiment," Beal said. Just a few feet away from the 40 nets, his team found just 0.4 clams per square foot, suggesting predators account for the difference.
"We know that when we have cold water, we have more shellfish survival," says Freeport clammer Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association. "The real question is what we are going to do when it gets really warm again."
It's possible the warmer water will bring a solution with it.
At Nova Scotia's Kejimkujik National Park, rangers five years ago decided to take action against marauding green crabs, which already had torn up 88 percent of the eelgrass in the park's two estuaries, which face the open Atlantic near the entrance to the gulf. Their strategy: fish them hard with modified shrimp traps, composting the catch until a market develops. "It looks like we've had phenomenal success," Parks Canada ecologist Chris McCarthy says.
By 2013, trapping had helped knock the crab population down to size, with the average haul per trap falling from nearly 50 to fewer than eight. And as they cleaned out the green crabs, eelgrass returned, along with eels, geese, migrating shorebirds, proper water quality and the stability of the surrounding marsh. The park staff wondered whether the gains would be maintained if they started scaling back trapping.
Then a new invader started showing up in the traps: Callinectes sapidus, the Atlantic blue crab, a delicious cousin of the green crabs that is as iconic to the culture of the Chesapeake as lobsters are to Maine. Normally not seen north of Cape Cod, they began showing up in 2013 at Kejimkujik, where they were caught by the hundreds last year. "We've seen them chasing the green crabs around, so hopefully they'll have an effect on them without harming the sea grass," McCarthy says. "The big question will be if they can really establish themselves, given that we get fairly cold waters up here."
Harris, of UNH, says they're likely to do so, as southwestern Nova Scotia has fairly warm water. In fact, he says, there's now a small resident population in the Great Bay and Piscataqua River on the Maine-New Hampshire border. And despite two cold winters, he's seen the whole crab assemblage continuing to shift eastward, with Bar Harbor lobstermen catching blue crabs last year, Asian shore crabs taking over seacoast New Hampshire, Jonah crabs -- which once ranged no farther than Casco Bay -- established in Eastport, and large numbers of green crabs surviving cold Cobscook Bay winters, an indication that the species may be adapting to colder water.
The net ecological effect is anyone's guess. Adult Asian shore crabs will eat green crabs and aren't attracted to muddy areas, but they do enjoy stripping the shore of barnacles. Adult blue crabs will happily munch on green ones, but nobody knows what they'll do to, say, eelgrass. "Blue crabs are something fishermen can sell, so that's a good thing; but on the other hand, it's also an indication that the species composition of the intertidal zone is shifting," Harris says. "In terms of the overall effect, it's really too early to tell."

Full text:   On Nov. 3, Mainers will vote on three statewide referendum questions. One of these questions will have a direct impact on our roads, bridges and other modes of transportation that the working people and businesses of our state rely on every day.
Question 3 asks whether voters favor an $85 million bond issue for construction and maintenance of highways and roads, bridges and multimodal facilities such as ports, harbors, freight and passenger rail, aviation, transit and bicycle and pedestrian trails. A yes vote approves the bond issue.
As House chair of the Legislature's Transportation Committee, I worked closely with my colleagues on this bond issue, as well as a range of other transportation funding measures. States across the country are facing challenges when it comes to maintaining our infrastructure, not just Maine.
But we do have some unique challenges. Maine has a relatively small population spread over a large state. In fact, we have roughly twice as many miles of roads and bridges to take care of as New Hampshire, which has a population similar to ours.
Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of issuing the $85 million in bonds for these transportation needs before sending the proposal to Maine voters for final approval, as required by the Maine Constitution.
The bonds gained strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate because of the funding's importance to our state's future. Maine people deserve safer roads and a stronger economy, both of which will take adequate investment in our transportation system.
If approved, $68 million of these funds will be used to construct and repair state highways, repair secondary roads in partnership with local communities and replace or rehabilitate bridges. The remaining $17 million would be dedicated to a variety of other projects with the priority of identifying and targeting those that most improve public safety and support economic growth.
The $85 million investment will be used to leverage an additional estimated $121.5 million in federal and other funds. That means more than $200 million overall of improvements to our roads, bridges and other crucial projects.
If you drive on our state's roads, you don't need me to tell you the condition our infrastructure is in. Years of chronic underfunding have left our transportation system in rough shape. In the Portland area, 61 percent of major urban roads are in poor or mediocre condition.
According to the Maine Department of Transportation's three-year work plan, current funding falls short of the investment needed to keep up with basic maintenance of our existing road and bridge network by roughly $119 million annually.
It's a problem that affects Mainers every day. According to the state section of the American Society of Engineers, Maine motorists spend an extra $300 each year to maintain their vehicles because of the condition of our roads. Added vehicle maintenance costs are a burden on commuters and businesses alike.
Beyond these unnecessary costs, the aging and inadequate condition of our infrastructure has consequences for our economy. Think of our vibrant agricultural sector and farmers' need to get their products -- whether a truckload of potatoes, coolers of lamb chops from a small family farm or bushels of blueberries -- to market efficiently.
Our world-famous lobsters, clams, oysters and other seafood need to reach their final destination in the freshest condition possible. Eighteen-wheelers loaded with logs have to travel for miles to deliver their cargo. The reliability of Maine's roads matters to workers, about three-fourths of whom commute alone. Our state's large size and rural nature mean Mainers often travel long distances to their workplaces.
Tourists rely on our roads and highways when they come to Maine, whether they're leaf-peeping, going to the beach or heading into the mountains to ski or hike. The Maine Tourism Association has pointed out the importance of our transportation system to its industry, one of our largest economic sectors.
It says the condition of our roads plays a role in attracting the visitors who stay at our hotels, dine in our restaurants and patronize our shops and a wide range of other businesses. To keep them coming, we need to take care of our transportation infrastructure.
To learn more about Question 3 and the other referendum questions, visit the Maine Secretary of State's website. And vote on Nov. 3.
Rep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, is serving his second term in the Maine Legislature. He is chairman of the Transportation Committee.

Abstract: The Gulf of Maine -- which extends from Cape Cod in Massachusetts to Cape Sable at the southern tip of Nova Scotia and includes the Bay of Fundy, the offshore fishing banks, and the entire coast of Maine -- has been warming rapidly as the deep-water currents that feed it have shifted. Since 2004 the gulf has warmed faster than anyplace else on the planet, except for an area northeast of Japan, and during the "Northwest Atlantic Ocean heat wave" of 2012, average water temperatures hit the highest level in the 150 years that humans have been recording them.

First of six parts
YARMOUTH BAR, Nova Scotia -- Sandwiched on a narrow sandbar between Yarmouth's harbor and the open Gulf of Maine, the fishermen of Yarmouth Bar have long struggled to keep the sea at bay.
In the 19th century, storms threatened to sweep the whole place away, leaving Yarmouth proper's harbor more open to the elements, prompting the province to build a granite cribwork across the quarter-mile bar, behind which the hamlet's fishing fleet docks. Global warming has brought rising seas, a two-story-high rock wall to fight them and the hamlet's designation as one of the communities in the province most threatened by climate change.
Now, snaking around the snout of Nova Scotia and into the Gulf of Maine is a new, unseen threat to Yarmouth Bar and hundreds of coastal communities in Maine, eastern New England and the Maritimes: currents fueling the rapid warming of the sea.
The Gulf of Maine -- which extends from Cape Cod in Massachusetts to Cape Sable at the southern tip of Nova Scotia and includes the Bay of Fundy, the offshore fishing banks, and the entire coast of Maine -- has been warming rapidly as the deep-water currents that feed it have shifted. Since 2004 the gulf has warmed faster than anyplace else on the planet, except for an area northeast of Japan, and during the "Northwest Atlantic Ocean heat wave" of 2012, average water temperatures hit the highest level in the 150 years that humans have been recording them.
As a result, many native species -- boreal and subarctic creatures at the southern edges of their ranges -- are in retreat. Lobster populations have been shifting northward and out to sea along our coast as they've abandoned Long Island Sound almost entirely. Many other commercially important bottom-dwelling fish -- including cod, pollock and winter flounder -- have been withdrawing from Maine and into the southwestern part of the gulf, where the bottom water is cooler.
"We're really in the cross hairs of climate change right now," says Andy Pershing, chief scientific officer at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, who first revealed the alarming pace of the gulf's recent warming.
For two years running, Maine's northern shrimp fishery has been closed for lack of shrimp. Endangered right whales virtually have stopped visiting the waters off Lubec and Grand Manan because the tiny cold-loving copepods that they feed on -- as do herring and, indirectly, almost everything else in the gulf -- are in short supply there.
Warm-water invaders are gaining a toehold, and those that already had one are taking over. Green crab populations exploded in 2012 and 2013, extirpating soft-shell clams from vast areas of mudflats and stripping the northern parts of Casco Bay of their life-sustaining eelgrass meadows, which have yet to recover. Blue crabs, a species normally identified with the sultry Chesapeake, have been found in lobster traps and have started making themselves at home in southwestern Nova Scotia. Asian shore crabs now dominate the shores of seacoast New Hampshire. Ugly, bottom-smothering sea squirts have spread across the seafloor all the way to Eastport, displacing the animals that the gulf's sea creatures actually want to eat.
"The main message is that fish are definitely on the move," says Michael Fogarty, chief of the ecosystem assessment program at the National Marine Fisheries Service's Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. "There's no doubt about that, and it has ramifications for fishermen and the ecosystem."
In accordance with climate change models, the region also has been experiencing markedly increased rainfall and snowfall, reducing the salinity of the gulf and hampering the growth of the microscopic marine plants at the base of the food web. More frequent extreme precipitation events are making coastal waters more acidic, snuffing out baby oysters, mussels and other creatures that have difficulty building their shells under the new conditions.
"The impact of ocean acidification will be felt first by some of the wild bivalve fisheries like soft-shell clams and mussels," predicts oyster hatchery owner Bill Mook, who now often has to treat his water to make it alkaline enough for his stock. "It will be manifested by a failure of the larvae to become juveniles."
Two cold winters have given the gulf some breathing space, but climate models and recorded trends indicate our seas are going to keep warming, with the conditions experienced in the "ocean heat wave" becoming the new normal by midcentury. The result will be dramatic changes in an ecosystem Mainers have relied on since the end of the last ice age, ones for which our communities, industries and government are poorly prepared to face.
"We're conducting this great experiment, but we don't have a pristine control site to compare results to," says Larry Harris, a marine zoologist at the University of New Hampshire who studies invasive species. "Unfortunately we only have one Gulf of Maine."
Few places in the world's oceans are as well-suited to sustaining marine life as the Gulf of Maine. By a fortunate confluence of geography, geology, climate and oceanography, the gulf is a fertile oasis in an ocean that is, ecologically speaking, largely desert.
On a standard map, the gulf looks like little more than a bulge of the Atlantic Ocean; but on a nautical chart its true nature is revealed. Hidden just a few dozen feet beneath the waves at its southern entrance are two enormous submerged islands -- Georges and Browns banks -- which separate it from the surrounding ocean, deflecting and shaping ocean currents. It's really a semi-enclosed sea, like the Baltic or Mediterranean seas, with characteristics all its own.
Two narrow channels provide the only deep-water connections into the gulf. The larger of these, the Northeast Channel, is only 22 miles wide, but through it often flows a cold, nutrient-rich current originating among the ice floes of northern Labrador. It courses around the end of Nova Scotia and loops the mouth of the Bay of Fundy before flowing down the coast of Maine like an ecological conveyor belt, then arcing back around the northern flank of Georges Bank to form a spinning, life-sustaining gyre.
In the oceans, as on land, plants are at the base of the food web, capturing and storing the sun's energy through photosynthesis. At sea, most plants are microscopic, and they generally thrive when two things can be found at once: light, which is available only near the surface, and nutrients, which tend to fall to the dark ocean floor. The Gulf of Maine puts these things together in myriad ways.
First there are the river systems -- the Kennebec, Penobscot, St. Croix, St. John and 21 others -- that together drain a quarter-trillion gallons of fresh, nutrient-laden water into the gulf each year, further fertilizing the sea. The cold climate plays a role, helping to prevent nutrient-rich bottom water from being trapped under a thick layer of warmer, lighter surface water, as happens in warmer climates.
Then there are the tides -- the world's highest, thanks to the fortuitous interaction of coastal geography and the orbital tracks of the Earth and moon around the sun -- rising and falling 50 feet and more at the head of the gulf, the Minas Basin in Nova Scotia, and then surging in and out of the Bay of Fundy, where it collides with the north-south tides flowing in and out of the bays and estuaries of Maine. The tides mix and churn the water, keeping nutrients suspended in the lighted surface waters and even forming the Western Hemisphere's largest whirlpool, the Old Sow off Eastport at the Maine-New Brunswick border. They also create vast expanses of critical habitat: the salt marshes, clam flats, mussel banks and seagrass meadows that serve as nurseries for countless marine creatures.
The tides and currents flow across a ragged coast, especially between Cape Elizabeth and Saint John, New Brunswick, where deep bays and estuaries reach 5, 10 or 20 miles inland between long peninsulas, and thousands of islands dot the coast. The gulf is only 400 miles across from the elbow of Cape Cod to the Minas Basin, but if the coast were stretched into a straight line it would run for 7,500 miles -- 3,000 more if the island shores were added. All that coastline makes for an incredible abundance of prime ocean habitat, with large quantities of rocky, complex seafloor located near enough to the surface to be bathed in life-sustaining light.
In its pristine state, the Gulf of Maine was stupendously productive. Early European explorers were flabbergasted by its largesse. They encountered great schools of whales, landed 5-foot-long cod with virtually every drop of a hand-held hook, and waded at low tide to capture 20-pound lobsters among the rocks.
It was in the pursuit of cod that Maine was first colonized, starting with year-round fishing stations at Damariscove, Monhegan and other islands in the decade prior to the Pilgrims' landing at Plymouth. The Pilgrims avoided starvation at the end of the winter of 1621-22 only by turning to Damariscove for food, and the later Puritan experiment at Massachusetts Bay was underwritten by its own fishing stations, leading 18th-century New England leaders to put the image of the cod on their coins and buildings.
"The members of the 'codfish aristocracy,' those who traced their family fortunes to the 17th-century cod fisheries, had openly worshiped the fish as the symbol of their wealth," Mark Kurlansky wrote in "Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World." "The Boston Town Hall ... had a gilded cod hanging from the ceiling (and) ... after the American Revolution a carved wooden cod was hung in the Old State House" as if overseeing the commonwealth's proceedings.
If anything, fishing had an even greater impact on Maine, where cod remained plentiful close to shore right into the 20th century. Using logbooks, a University of New Hampshire team led by maritime historian Karen Alexander reconstructed the 1861 catch of the small sailboat fleet operating out of a handful of hamlets between Blue Hill and Winter Harbor. Using baited hooks and hand-held lines, these day fishermen caught nearly 10,000 metric tons of cod -- more than the entire modern U.S. fleet in the Gulf of Maine was able to land between 1996 and 1999 with their powerful engines, enormous bottom-trawling nets and high-tech fish finders. The researchers estimated the overall 1861 catch in the U.S. part of the gulf at 78,600 metric tons.
This year's fishing quota is just 386 metric tons because so few cod remain, the result of overfishing in the late 20th century and the failure of the stock to fully rebound -- a result, it is thought, of the temperature changes. "The warm water is absolutely not making things easy for the cod," Pershing says.
Because it has been fed regularly by frigid currents originating in the Arctic, the gulf is home to a range of northern and subarctic species that could not thrive south of Cape Cod, where the warm Gulf Stream holds sway: cod, salmon, herring, mackerel, lobsters and a protein-packed, rice-sized copepod called Calanus finmarchicus, on which many other species rely. The cold kept pathogens away, and was too hardy for annoying creatures such as green crabs and jellyfish to take hold.
All that has been changing over the past decade, starting with the incoming currents from Canada. "There's been a marked change in the deep water coming into the Northeast Channel," says John Hare, a biological oceanographer and director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northeast Fisheries Science laboratory in Narragansett, Rhode Island. "There's much less of the colder Labrador water and more of the warmer water coming in from the (continental) slope."
This is likely a result of the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and ice from the Arctic Ocean over the past two decades, which has dumped huge quantities of very cold freshwater into the Labrador Sea, changing the arrangement of ocean currents. David Townsend, a biological oceanographer at the University of Maine who studies the phenomenon, says the localized effect has been the shifting of the extremely cold Labrador Slope Current away from the Gulf of Maine, resulting in greater deep-water inflows of warmer water coming up from the Gulf Stream to the south.
Temperature variability always has been a characteristic of the Gulf of Maine, which always has experienced three or five years of warmer temperatures followed by a similar period of cooler ones. We're still seeing that today, Townsend notes, based on pulses of cold water that still come down the coast of Nova Scotia and inhibit deeper continental slope water from entering our region. The difference in recent years is that when the Scotia current lulls, the slope water that pours in is far warmer than it once was.
"For reasons that we do not understand, there is less Labrador Slope water sitting outside the entrance to the Northeast Channel than there used to be," he says, helping drive the past decade's temperature spike in the Gulf of Maine.
What happens next "upstream" from us in Canadian waters is anyone's guess. Annual reports on the state of the Atlantic Canadian marine ecosystem produced by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans indicate above-normal surface- and bottom-water temperatures for several years running and record-breaking levels in some areas in 2012, including the eastern half of the Gulf of Maine. Catherine Johnson, of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Halifax, said the reasons for the warming of the deep water were not entirely clear, nor was it well understood how these effects would work their way down the shelf.
A half-dozen other Canadian government scientists who worked on the marine ecosystem assessment and other research relevant to the warming of the Gulf of Maine either did not respond to interview requests or could not obtain permission to speak to a reporter about them, and obtaining permission to speak to Johnson about her work took two months.
Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, government scientists have long been prevented from discussing climate change-related research with journalists -- sometimes unable even to answer questions about their own scientific papers in the public domain -- prompting protests across Canada and hampering efforts to integrate information across the Gulf of Maine. But on Oct. 19, Harper's Conservative Party lost the nation's federal election to the Liberals, who have pledged to change the policy after they are sworn in Nov. 4.
Amid the 10-year warming trend, the 2012 "ocean heat wave" stood out. Researchers think they've figured out why that year was so unusual, providing some indications of how likely the conditions are to repeat themselves.
During the winter of 2011-12, an already warming gulf was subject to unusually warm air temperatures, courtesy of the unusual behavior of the jet stream, the shifting front between cold Arctic and temperate continental air masses. "What was so peculiar was that the jet stream just locked in place for weeks at a time in a pattern that had warm air up above Quebec City all winter, and people were going around in their T-shirts in January," says Glen Gawarkiewicz, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who helped unlock the puzzle. "Normally that warm air would have been south of Maryland."
As a result, the gulf never properly cooled down. In the first half of the year, water temperatures across the gulf and down to 150 feet or more were about 4 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they usually were; in some places there was an 8-degree spike. Things warmed further through the summer, sending shock waves throughout the ecosystem.
Unfortunately, Gawarkiewicz says, the jet stream is still behaving strangely, getting stuck in place for long stretches of winter instead of undulating along over Maine, providing deep chills and brief thaws. The difference is that in the past three winters the jet stream has stalled with the Northeastern United States stuck in the cold and the western United States in sustained warmth, whereas the opposite was true in 2011-12. "Fundamentally, the dynamics of the jet stream are changing, and we're not sure why," he says.
Meanwhile, climate models predict atmospheric temperatures will continue to increase in New England in the coming decades, with average surface temperatures reaching 4 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit higher in 2050 then they are today, according to Massachusetts' Climate Change Adaptation Advisory Committee. Average summer sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine region will increase by about 5.5 degrees -- a rate of just over 0.1 degree a year -- between now and 2065, according to projections averaging the results of six independent models by a team led by John Loder, an ocean modeler at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, a Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans research institute in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.
That's less than the past decade's unusually steep average rate (0.4 degrees Fahrenheit a year) but twice as fast as the 30-year warming trend in the gulf (0.054 per year). If the projections are accurate, sea temperatures comparable to 2012's could be the "new normal" by 2050.
Preliminary modeling by Canadian scientists of the ecosystem effects of a 1.8-degree Fahrenheit increase in average sea surface temperatures in our region over the next 50 years predicted a reduction in the total mass of all creatures currently living in the region of 19 percent to 29 percent. The biggest factors, says co-author Sylvie Guenette, a fisheries biologist in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, were marked declines in phytoplankton and Calanus finmarchicus, which would trigger steep declines in cod, herring, lobster and other species. "This model is a first attempt, and there's a lot of uncertainty in this," she says, not least the fact that since it was created in 2009, predictions of how much the Gulf of Maine would heat up have more than tripled.
While nobody knows for sure what all this will mean for marine life and the coastal economy, 2012 provided a sobering glimpse into a warmer future.
That May, lobster fishermen were shocked to encounter strong runs of newly shedded lobsters, six weeks ahead of their usual schedule. "Nobody knew what was happening, just that there were lobsters to catch," says Islesford lobsterman David Thomas. "It kind of rattled everybody's cage and made a big economic problem."
Maine lobstermen were pulling up mountains of soft-shell lobsters, but dealers had nowhere to send them. The Maritimes processing plants that usually purchase the lion's share were still busy with the spring harvest from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The price plummeted until it got so low the processors reconsidered, buying up the glut of cheap Maine lobsters instead of local lobsters, prompting eastern New Brunswick lobstermen to blockade trucks of Maine lobsters to prevent them from unloading. Police tactical teams responded to calls for help from lobster plants that had been surrounded by hundreds of angry lobstermen.
Meanwhile, the warmer water triggered an explosion in the population of green crabs, which proceeded to devour most of the clams in Freeport, Brunswick, Penobscot and other towns. "Green crabs were literally boiling up out of the ocean," says Freeport clammer Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association. "They ate everything, all the sea grass, tearing up the shore."
Marissa McMahan, now a doctoral student at Northeastern University, was lobstering with her father off Georgetown that summer and was surprised to find a large, stout-bodied gray-and-black fish in a trap. "I had to ask him what it was -- a black sea bass -- and he'd only seen four or five in his 40-plus years on the water," she says. By the end of the summer they'd caught nearly 20 of the warm-water bottom fish, which normally live off New Jersey and Delaware. "Fishermen up and down the coast were seeing the same thing."
On Eastern Egg Rock, puffin chicks starved because their parents were unable to find appropriate food for them; while off Grand Manan Island, northern right whales failed to find swarms of Calanus finmarchicus to eat.
Cod, which fishermen had hoped were recovering from the overfishing of the late 20th century, were found to be in bad shape across the region, with very few young fish present in either the interior of the gulf or Georges Bank. Fishing quotas in the interior gulf were cut by 80 percent that year, and as bad news continued to roll in, the fishery was essentially closed in 2014, with federal regulators estimating the stock at less than 4 percent of the level deemed sustainable.
While 2012 was the warmest year on record, the ecosystem has been responding to the rapid warming of the past decade as well.
William Balch, of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay, has documented a reduction in the growth of phytoplankton, the microscopic plants at the base of the food chain. Each month in the growing season since 1998, Balch and his colleagues have surveyed the tiny plants from the Nova Star and its predecessor ferries as they cross the gulf from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, to Portland. (When ferry service was interrupted, they used other vessels.) The readings were constant until 2007, when they saw phytoplankton concentrations fall by about three-quarters, where they've stayed ever since.
Why? Balch thinks it's because of increased precipitation, which has substantially increased river flows into the gulf. This water is laden with tea-colored dissolved organic matter that happens to absorb sunlight in the same wavelengths craved by the phytoplankton, essentially cutting off their energy supply. The reduced flow of deep, cold Labrador water into the gulf -- a key source of silicate, a nutrient needed by some types of phytoplankton -- may have compounded the problem.
"It's a double whammy when you lower a plant's light and its nutrients," he says. (Disclosure: This reporter is a Bigelow trustee.)
Maine and the region are poorly prepared for the challenges ahead, with critical scientific programs having been cut by Congress and the Canadian Parliament and climate change planning having been assigned a low priority under the administration of Maine Gov. Paul LePage.
"Changes are coming. It's inevitable," says Lou Van Guelpen, curator of fishes at the Huntsman Marine Science Center in St. Andrews, New Brunswick. "We don't really know what their effects will be, but they're happening faster and they're happening now."

Full text:   Dubois says business legit; town says farm operating without permit
A putrid stench that has permeated parts of York County since Tuesday is coming from a farm and composting business in Arundel that is operating in violation of local and state rules, officials said.
However, a company official said the business owners are merely trying to keep their hay fields healthy by covering them with a combination of compost and chicken manure.
He blamed adverse weather conditions for the smell and said the business is operating within its rights.
Dubois Livestock & Excavating Inc. at 2 Irving Road treated its hay fields with a material that created the odor, according to Mike Clark, an environmental specialist with the state Department of Environmental Protection, who visited the Dubois property Wednesday to follow up on numerous complaints.
"They refused to talk to me," Clark said. "They refused to let me on the premises."
Clark believes the material spread on the fields is mostly compost, which in itself is not a violation. However, DEP rules say compost must be sufficiently cured so it does not create a "nuisance odor."
Since Dubois refused to let him inspect the site, Clark said the DEP is determining what its next step will be toward getting the business to comply with state rules.
"We prefer voluntary compliance," he said, "but voluntary compliance starts with communication."
Sol Fedder, an officer and director of Dubois, said the compost has been cured to reduce the odor, and that easterly winds and a lack of rain are what caused the smell to spread and linger.
"We have to use something to make the grass grow," he said. "If we had something that smelled nicer, we'd use that."
Dubois also is in violation of a town ordinance for operating its composting business on an expired conditional use permit, Arundel Town Planner Tad Redway said.
The town decided not to renew the permit in 2011 after Dubois refused to comply with certain required conditions, according to documents filed in Maine Supreme Judicial Court. When Dubois did not cease its composting operations, the town sued and won in York County Superior Court.
The business appealed the decision to the supreme court, arguing that the town did not have proper jurisdiction to bar it from operating, but the court again ruled in favor of Arundel.
Still, Dubois has not stopped making compost. Its website touts the business as "Maine's largest agricultural compost facility" and promotes the fact that its compost includes shellfish. The company also raises pigs and rabbits, sells firewood and offers excavation and demolition services. Customer testimonials on the site praise the quality of Dubois' compost and topsoil.
But neighbors say the periodic stench has been getting worse in recent months, and that they have had enough. One group of nearby residents, who asked not to be named, has been distributing fliers encouraging others to file complaints with local and state officials.
"We encourage you to call these folks whenever you have had enough of the stink and make your concerns known," the fliers say. "Call, and keep calling every time you are offended by the smell until the town and state authorities take a stand and hold Dubois accountable."
Arundel Town Manager Keith Trefethen said the town is not giving up. It has filed a second lawsuit against Dubois and Randrick Trust, the legal entity that owns the business, in an effort to enforce the previous court order.
"Right now they have no permit," Trefethen said. "The remedy we have is to go back to court."
Fedder said a new amendment to the Maine Agriculture Protection Act that takes effect Monday should exempt Dubois from town ordinances, which is what the business plans to argue in court.
"There's nothing wrong with what we're doing, and it's exactly right what we're doing," he said.
He said Dubois did not allow DEP to inspect its fields Wednesday because its owners have a long-standing "personal dispute" with Clark, the environmental specialist.
"We've had a history with the DEP guy," he said.
But Clark said there is nothing personal about it, and that it is merely a case of one company refusing to comply with state rules.
"They don't like being regulated -- they've made that clear," he said.

Recalling the world of invasive periwinkles

Full text:   OUR ROUTINES DON'T take us down to the fresh ruffles of the surf very often these days, but somehow, the sea is always with me. When I was a kid I lived whole summers digging and scattering sand on beaches in Casco Bay. And more often I poked around in low-tide pools and algaes baking on damp ledges, and malingered under wharves funky with kelp and bait smells.
Down in that gloomy intertidal no-man's-land, periwinkles were everywhere. They dotted the rocks and pilings, inhabited the seaweed. To a kid they were as motionless as stones and practically inanimate, even though you knew they were alive. Six or eight of them might be arrayed in a trapezoidal shape on a flat spur of ledge, then if you wandered away and later returned, the trapezoid had turned into a U. How did they do that, and when?
Barnacles don't move at all. They cement their heads directly onto the rock and stay there, but periwinkles suction themselves to flat surfaces at their shell aperture, and shove one foot out to push around, typical of gastropods -- a class of mollusks with spiral shells. Periwinkles have soft bodies and a head inside the permanent univalve shell (as opposed to bivalves like clams, scallops and mussels). South of New England there are tremendous varieties of periwinkle kin, from whelks, cowries, conchs and murexes, to wentletraps, tritons and augers. Don't ask me to identify these creatures I've mostly only read about and have no karmic links to. That I know of.
The three main periwinkle species I had a firsthand relationship with as a kid look a lot alike: the common periwinkle (Littorina littorea); the rough periwinkle (L. saxatilis); and the smooth periwinkle (L. obtusata). The common periwinkle has a purple-brown shell, with fewer color variations than the others. The rough periwinkle has deeper ridges in its shell. And the smooth periwinkle tends to look shinier and is often banded and brighter-colored in green and yellow.
The common periwinkles, believe it or not, are an invasive species. The first report of their presence in North America was near Pictou, Nova Scotia, in the 1840s. They appear to have come from Ireland and Scotland, according to a study led by University of Maine marine biologist Susan Brawley, probably on ballast rock picked up in Britain and discharged in the Maritimes. Or possibly they were deliberately transplanted for food.
They expanded their new range rapidly, and are now found from Labrador to Delaware, in addition to their original digs on Northern Europe's coasts.
They scrape algae off rocks and seaweed with a tooth-riddled contraption called a radula, which sticks out of the same aperture as the foot. There are so many of them off our coast that they sometimes devour all the competitors of Irish moss, which takes over in places, disrupting the ecosystem. Life is hazardous in the intertidal zone, and even nastier as you cross the line into the deeper water where their larger cousins the whelks are outright carnivorous.
Periwinkles have sensory organs for feel, smell and taste, and there's a legend that humming a tune can induce it to open its operculum, or aperture cover, though I've never tried this and couldn't find a scientific website that mentions it. It seems too civilized to be true, but some of my co-workers say they've seen it happen.
In Europe and Asia, periwinkles, aka snails, are still commonly eaten, and they've been harvested for those markets by Down East "wrinklers" in considerable quantities since about the late 1980s. One year nearly 4 million pounds were taken. More recently the harvest has approached about 1 million pounds a year, according to state figures.
Unless you crush a periwinkle or bore a hole in its shell, the tight-sealed aperture is the only way into it. Years ago, a friend who studied nutritional self-sufficiency experimented with collecting periwinkles on the shore in Portland and boiling them. They're easier to gather than clams, but eating them turns out to be labor-intensive. The cooked periwinkle meat is hard to dig out without breaking the shell and getting bites full of shards. Unless you're a green crab, which crushes them in its claw and discards the pieces.

Full text:   OUR ROUTINES DON'T take us down to the fresh ruffles of the surf very often these days, but somehow, the sea is always with me. When I was a kid I lived whole summers digging and scattering sand on beaches in Casco Bay. And more often I poked around in low-tide pools and algaes baking on damp ledges, and malingered under wharves funky with kelp and bait smells.
Down in that gloomy intertidal no-man's-land, periwinkles were everywhere. They dotted the rocks and pilings, inhabited the seaweed. To a kid they were as motionless as stones and practically inanimate, even though you knew they were alive. Six or eight of them might be arrayed in a trapezoidal shape on a flat spur of ledge, then if you wandered away and later returned, the trapezoid had turned into a U. How did they do that, and when?
Barnacles don't move at all. They cement their heads directly onto the rock and stay there, but periwinkles suction themselves to flat surfaces at their shell aperture, and shove one foot out to push around, typical of gastropods -- a class of mollusks with spiral shells. Periwinkles have soft bodies and a head inside the permanent univalve shell (as opposed to bivalves like clams, scallops and mussels). South of New England there are tremendous varieties of periwinkle kin, from whelks, cowries, conchs and murexes, to wentletraps, tritons and augers. Don't ask me to identify these creatures I've mostly only read about and have no karmic links to. That I know of.
The three main periwinkle species I had a firsthand relationship with as a kid look a lot alike: the common periwinkle (Littorina littorea); the rough periwinkle (L. saxatilis); and the smooth periwinkle (L. obtusata). The common periwinkle has a purple-brown shell, with fewer color variations than the others. The rough periwinkle has deeper ridges in its shell. And the smooth periwinkle tends to look shinier and is often banded and brighter-colored in green and yellow.
The common periwinkles, believe it or not, are an invasive species. The first report of their presence in North America was near Pictou, Nova Scotia, in the 1840s. They appear to have come from Ireland and Scotland, according to a study led by University of Maine marine biologist Susan Brawley, probably on ballast rock picked up in Britain and discharged in the Maritimes. Or possibly they were deliberately transplanted for food.
They expanded their new range rapidly, and are now found from Labrador to Delaware, in addition to their original digs on Northern Europe's coasts.
They scrape algae off rocks and seaweed with a tooth-riddled contraption called a radula, which sticks out of the same aperture as the foot. There are so many of them off our coast that they sometimes devour all the competitors of Irish moss, which takes over in places, disrupting the ecosystem. Life is hazardous in the intertidal zone, and even nastier as you cross the line into the deeper water where their larger cousins the whelks are outright carnivorous.
Periwinkles have sensory organs for feel, smell and taste, and there's a legend that humming a tune can induce it to open its operculum, or aperture cover, though I've never tried this and couldn't find a scientific website that mentions it. It seems too civilized to be true, but some of my co-workers say they've seen it happen.
In Europe and Asia, periwinkles, aka snails, are still commonly eaten, and they've been harvested for those markets by Down East "wrinklers" in considerable quantities since about the late 1980s. One year nearly 4 million pounds were taken. More recently the harvest has approached about 1 million pounds a year, according to state figures.
Unless you crush a periwinkle or bore a hole in its shell, the tight-sealed aperture is the only way into it. Years ago, a friend who studied nutritional self-sufficiency experimented with collecting periwinkles on the shore in Portland and boiling them. They're easier to gather than clams, but eating them turns out to be labor-intensive. The cooked periwinkle meat is hard to dig out without breaking the shell and getting bites full of shards. Unless you're a green crab, which crushes them in its claw and discards the pieces.
I relate all this gathered-up information from one sort of distance or another. For as I say, we don't make many voyages to the shore nowadays and I don't have the same consanguinities with periwinkles that I have with, say, chickadees. So the fascination goes back to chthonic memories, bleached by time and the elements, of shell shucks under low-tide wharves, when it barely registered to me that they were even alive.

Full text:   "You can accomplish the project's goals in a smarter, cheaper way that doesn't put existing lobstering and tourism and other industries at risk."
Kim Ervin Tucker
SEARSPORT -- The BBC Amber is at the dock on an early August afternoon, unloading wind turbine tower segments bound for the Passadumkeag Mountain wind project in Grand Falls Township, 70 miles to the north.
At 14,000 tons, it is a relatively small vessel, drawing just 24 feet on arrival, and was able to transit the channel to Searsport, located at the head of Penobscot Bay, without concern for the 10-foot tides or high spots, where as much as 4 feet of silt has fallen into the channel since it was last dredged a half century ago. But on both the day before and the day that followed, two 23,000-ton oil tankers had been forced to wait for a rising tide to proceed into the port, where oil, gasoline, road salt, wood pulp and other cargo are offloaded, much of it bound for the landlocked interior.
However, an extensive dredging project proposed to improve and upgrade Maine's second-busiest port has raised alarm bells up and down Penobscot Bay, where fishermen, shellfish farmers, owners of tourism-dependent businesses, and environmentalists fear it will trigger an ecological and economic catastrophe.
"If you sat down and tried to find a way to guarantee you would contaminate the entire food web with methyl mercury, they've come up with it," said Kim Ervin Tucker, the Lincolnville attorney representing many of the opponents, including local lobstermen, businesspeople and the Sierra Club. "You can accomplish the project's goals in a smarter, cheaper way that doesn't put existing lobstering and tourism and other industries at risk."
The port, created in 1964 when ships were smaller and safety requirements laxer, is long overdue for an upgrade, said David Gelinas, president of the local pilots' association, who is thrilled that the Army Corps of Engineers has proposed to improve the approaches to the port, deepening the design depth from 35 to 40 feet and substantially widening the turning basin.
Anything less, Gelinas says, will compromise the port's long-term survival. "Economically, it's a slow strangulation," he says. "If you're stuck back in the '60s, you won't be a very competitive port very long in the future."
John Henshaw, director of the Maine Port Authority, predicts the upgrades would help attract new business to the port and the vast tracts of central and northern Maine it serves via railroad connections that run right to the bulk cargo dock. Look to the proposed wood chip plant in Prospect, he said, which would employ dozens and export its product to Europe from Searsport.
"The status quo is not a growth strategy," he said of critics' plans to reduce the scale of the dredging. "The shipping industry has changed a lot in the 50 years since the channel was designed, and we need to accommodate those changes."
Opponents of the project -- which has to obtain permits from the state Department of Environmental Protection to proceed -- question whether it needs to be as extensive as the Army Corps of Engineers has proposed, especially given the environmental risks.
At issue are the waste products: nearly a million cubic yards of material to be dredged from the port area, at least some of which is contaminated with mercury and other toxins released by polluters along the Penobscot River, the mouth of which is next to the port.
The area to be dredged is 3 miles west of the mouth of the Penobscot River, where state authorities have banned lobster and crab fishing since February 2014 after crustaceans in the area were found to have high levels of mercury in their flesh.
The lobsters and crabs had been tested as a result of a court order in a federal suit against the former owners of the HoltraChem plant in Orrington, a bleach-making facility that released large quantities of mercury directly into the river between 1967 and 1982. On Wednesday, a judge ordered the firm that owned the plant at that time, Mallinckrodt, to pay for an engineering study on how to remove the toxic heavy metal from the lower 20 miles of the river, a project estimated to cost $130 million.
Kevin Yeager, the University of Kentucky geologist who served as the court-appointed sedimentation expert in the HoltraChem case, issued a report in July 2014 taking the Corps to task for relying on faulty testing of the sediments in the Searsport dredge area. The Corps tests, he wrote, "suggest these sediments are quite contaminated" but that proper testing and analysis was "highly likely" to show an even greater degree of contamination.
According to project documents, the Corps wants to remove the most contaminated material -- surface material with high levels of heavy metals and polycyclic hydrocarbons -- and dump them into a series of deep, cone-shaped pockmarks in the bay's floor halfway between Islesboro and the Northport shore. They would then cover them with cleaner dredge material, sealing it away from the environment.
The Corps has argued that the sediments are suitable for disposal at the western Penobscot Bay site. Officials at the Corps' New England regional office said they could not respond to critics' comments at this time.
Given the contamination, many around Penobscot Bay fear the proposed disposal site is not an appropriate place for it.
Joe Kelley, of the University of Maine, a former state geologist who has mapped the bay's bottom, has said the pockmarks are geologically unstable and formed by the venting of methane gas. Scouring by ocean currents probably would resuspend any material stored in them. At a June 9 hearing, he testified that the Corps in fact knew this, and in the 1990s had rejected them as a suitable place to dump dredge spoils in the 1990s.
"I was surprised by this (new) proposal in light of the prior rejection of this area ... and the known risks of using this area for this purpose," he stated. "The possibility of resuspension of buried contaminants, including HoltraChem-contaminated material, makes the use of pockmarks in this area even more dangerous, and threatens the reputation for wholesomeness of all Penobscot Bay fishing resources."
Armindy McFadden, who manages a Lincolnville Beach restaurant and co-owns a Northport mussel farm located just 5,000 feet from the proposed disposal site, said it's an outrageous idea. "Generations of people have been dumping stuff in that harbor and now they want to put it in a 400-foot methane hole that geologists have said for 20 years is too terrible to use," she said.
"People aren't going to come here if the think the bay is polluted, and if the brand name of Maine lobster is tainted in any way, shape or form, then our entire economy in Maine as we know it is going to be affected," she added. "This is the first time the Sierra Club and the lobstermen and all these businesses have been on the same page. This is one central issue that this entire area feels strongly about."
Steve Miller, executive director of the Islesboro Islands Trust -- which is intervening against the project before the DEP -- agrees. "The science is telling us the material would probably be redistributed in the water column and carried south over lobster feeding areas and so forth," he said. "It's an experiment, and we don't want to be treated like a guinea pig up here."
Belfast lobster fisherman David Black, who fishes the area around the proposed disposal site, said area lobsterman fear the destruction of the fishery. "We understand that dredging is an important part of keeping working waterfronts open on the coast of Maine," Black said. "However, we don't like the idea of dropping a million cubic yards of dredge spoils right in the middle of upper Penobscot Bay.
"There is an alternative which is much less environmentally damaging than the one they are propoising," he added.
Black and the other opponents want the DEP to reject the plan, arguing the port's needs can be met under an alternate scheme that would dredge about one-10th as much material, reducing the danger of contamination. This proposal would deepen the berth at the Searsport dock but would not expand the turning basin or deepen the channel beyond 35 feet.
They have been urging the DEP to consider the plan -- created by Dawson & Associates, a Washington, D.C., consultancy focusing on Corps projects -- which they say would be cheaper and would allow the port to meet current traffic needs, even if some vessels have to play the tides. "We're not objecting to bringing in deeper-draft vessels; we say you can bring them in in a smarter, cheaper way without stirring up the mercury everyone knows is there," attorney Tucker said.
Port interests are unimpressed with the "Dawson alternative." Henshaw, the state's ports director, called it "a recipe for the status quo."
"Essentially, you're saying that you don't even want to accommodate the existing traffic, and we'd see declines of traffic over time," he added.
The project requires DEP permits to proceed, and outgoing DEP Commissioner Patricia Aho has said for months that she intends to hold adjudicatory hearing on the project, but has yet to announced a date. Department spokesperson David Madore said the department couldn't discuss the project because it would "compromise the integrity of the hearing process."
An official at the state Department of Marine Resources said staff members there were compiling a report for DEP on how the project would affect area fisheries, and that it would be completed in several weeks.
The Searsport project manager at the Army Corps of Engineer's New England District Office in Concord, Massachusetts, Barbara Blumeris, also said she couldn't comment, apart from describing the process. Even if the project receives DEP approval, she said, it still had a number of hurdles to cross: approval from an internal review board and the agency's chief of engineers, authorization from Congress, appropriation of congressional funds, the design of the detailed engineering plan, and sending the project out to bid.
Even in the best case scenario, she said, the project is unlikely to start earlier than November 2018. "We have lots of work to do," she noted.

Full text:   If I could see the weedy mussels Crusting the wrecked and rotting hulls
-- From "Exile" by Edna St. Vincent Millay
CASCO BAY -- The survey map in Ann Thayer's hand showed fat red splotches that wrapped around two-thirds of Bangs Island's shoreline, meaning that the intertidal zone -- the zone between the high and low water marks -- was supposed to be densely packed with mussel beds. The tide was nearly three hours past high, leaving plenty of rockweed exposed.
Thayer began systematically flipping over the weed, looking for mussels, aka Mytilus edulis, attached to the rock below.
"Nothing," she said. She said this over and over.
By the time she got back into her dinghy to row back to her Boston Whaler, she'd found only two mussels. Two where surveys from the 1970s and 1990s indicated there should be thousands, mollusks wedged into almost every nook and cranny in the rocks, the blue-hued shellfish nearly as commonplace as the barnacles living on their shells.
Thayer, who serves on the board of directors of Friends of Casco Bay, was not surprised by her findings.
They repeated what she's been seeing since 2013, when she started surveying, with the help of other volunteers, the dwindling mussel population of Casco Bay. More than half the surveyed sites have yielded no mussels where once there were plenty.
Up the coast, say in Hancock County, mussels can still be found in the intertidal zone. But another recently completed survey of 20 locations all along the state's coastline by Cascade Sorte, a former UMass Boston professor now at University of California Irvine, was equally disheartening. Sorte hasn't crunched all the numbers yet, but the problem seems to be across the board in Maine.
"It used to be that mussels were covering over half the space in the intertidal zone," Sorte said. "More than 50 percent of the space and now they are covering typically less than 10 percent. They have gone from this species that basically defined the rocky coastline to being a minor part of it."
Minor as in, nearly gone from the shores of Bangs Island. And here's the confusing bit: Maybe a 10-minute lazy breast stroke away is the Bangs Island Mussel Farm, where cultivated mussels grow on ropes stretching down into the cool sea.
They can grow on mussel farms, whether on the bottom or on ropes, but they aren't growing in the intertidal zone. There's enough seed, or spat, for farmers to grow them. But they're not ending up on shore the way they used to. The big mystery is why. Without knowing that, nothing can be reversed -- if in fact, it still can.
On this island trip -- she's taken many, and is always looking for new volunteers to help with the ongoing survey -- at least Thayer hadn't heard the noise.
"Scurrying," she said. "Last year you'd flip over the weed, and you'd hear the noise of the green crabs scuttling away."
She found three green crabs under the weed and immediately dispatched the one she managed to catch. No sense in leaving it alive; even if the crabs aren't the only culprit behind Maine's disappearing mussels, most consider them to be at least a part of the problem.
Other factors that are being considered by the sleuthing environmentalists and marine biologists working on this mystery include warming temperatures, ocean acidification, hungry eider ducks, predatory jellyfish eating the mussels in their larval stage, sea squirts, bacterial diseases, hard winters that rough up the intertidal zone, the impact of dragging on the mussel beds in past decades and changes to the substrate where mussels typically grow.
For every mussel expert you talk to, you'll hear a slightly different combination of which of these is doing the most harm.
If you look at the numbers game in that random August afternoon search on Bangs Island, you'd point to the green crabs, outnumbering mussels 3-to-2.
But Sorte, the professor who surveyed for mussels in 20 locations across the coast -- all the way to West Quoddy Head in Lubec -- between 2011 and 2014, said the groups she worked with did not see that many green crabs. "They have been seen as the culprits in a lot of locations, but we don't have early data to support that," Sorte said. (Her final data will be available in about six months.)
Thayer's volunteers occasionally do their surveying by boat or kayak, as well as on foot. Sorte's group, mostly graduate students looking for field experience, did all their surveying by foot, with a team of at least six. They would put down measuring tapes and count mussels at even intervals. Four of the sites had been surveyed before, 16 were new sites since Sorte hoped to establish a baseline where none had previously existed. In the past, when mussels were abundant and worries were scarce, no one was counting.
Still, Sorte doesn't dismiss the green crabs as a factor. Or fluctuating temperatures on either end. "There are issues with ice scour," she said. "That is where the sea water freezes, and then you have these rafts that are rubbing around the rocks."
"I don't think anyone really knows," said Carter Newell, founder of Pemaquid Mussel Farms, which has operations from Stonington to Lamoine. He also set up the original Bangs Island operation and served as a biologist for Great Eastern, the mussel producers who made the Maine mussel fashionable in the early 1980s, back when The New York Times dubbed them "the mollusk of the moment." "So everyone is going to pick their favorite theory, right?"
Or theories. Take Tollef Olson. He started Bangs Island Mussel Farm, sold that, got into kelp farming with Ocean Approved, recently sold that and is working on a new kelp-related product. He's also a surfer, and like Thayer, serves on the board of directors of Friends of Casco Bay. Warming ocean temperatures -- the Gulf of Maine is the fastest-warming body of ocean water in the world -- could be a factor. "Mussels do have a temperature range they are comfortable with."
He's unsure what role acidification may be playing but says it's less obvious than it is with soft-shell clams. "I haven't seen the pitting," he said, referring to the degradation of the clam's shell. He added that clams, sitting in the mud rather than on it, as many mussels tend to grow, are more vulnerable because they are "encapsulated in an acidic environment."
Studies have found a connection between ocean acidification, caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and the weakening of a key component to a mussel's survival, the byssal threads (fibers of protein) that the mussels use to attach to rocks, docks and even the ocean bottom.
The intense amount of dragging that happened in the 1980s is also likely to have had an impact, Olson said, both in disrupting the substrate the mussels need to develop beds and depleting the population. He's seen the evidence firsthand when he's been diving, looking for undiscovered beds. "Back then people weren't thinking that way," he said. "So I am not speaking badly about them. Sometimes you don't know the effect of overfishing until later."
Not to be forgotten, Olson says, are the green crabs and another predator that likes to feed on mussels. "I have seen a huge increase in the number of eider ducks," Olson said. "They were hunted up through the 1960s, really hard, and now they've made a comeback in the last 15 years."
"They can literally eat their weight in mussels in a day," he added.
Poet Mary Oliver wrote of gathering mussels "in barnacled fistfuls" in "Mussels" -- "I reach forward into the dampness, my hands feeling everywhere for the best, the biggest." She published that poem in 1977. That was the year after Phil Gray started reaching into the dampness, foraging and then making his living from mussel harvesting.
He'd grown up in central Maine, his dad working at a paper mill in Millinocket. The way the economy revolved around the paper industry made Gray long for something more. He was a young man, reading Euell Gibbons, and in 1976 decided to go to the coast, joking that he was "stalking the blue-eyed scallop." But the blue-shelled mussel turned out to be his main prey. "They were so plentiful," he marveled.
That was the beginning of the uptick in landings. In 1975, Maine fishermen brought in 3.59 million pounds of mussels in the shell. In 1976, that number went up to 7 million and by 1977, they harvested 12.4 million pounds. Others were dragging, but Gray liked hand harvesting. "I felt I could put out a better product."
The numbers continued to climb as Maine mussels grew in popularity until volumewise (but not valuewise) mussel landings were outpacing those of soft-shell clams.
In Gray's heyday, he'd get about 100 bushels of mussels, or 5,000 pounds in a week. These days he's lucky to get 50 pounds, which he sells at farmers markets in Brunswick.
"A couple of times I had to buy mussels," Gray said. Even that hasn't been easy. "I have actually ended up selling Prince Edward Island mussels."
He won't do that again, though; he'd prefer to harvest soft shells and increasingly quahogs, which have shells tough enough to resist the onslaught of green crabs and are still thriving. And he does have cause for optimism: he recently found a few small pockets of wild mussels in the waters off Harpswell, including "the largest set of wild mussels that I have seen in eight years."
They're larger than what he's used to seeing, and he thinks natural selection is very much at play in the shift in where the mussels live.
Gray, 68, believes himself to be the last harvester of wild mussels in southern Maine. He might be right, said Denis-Marc Nault, supervisor with the Maine Department of Marine Resources' Division of Shellfish Management. "Wild harvesters are fewer and farther in between," he said. "Maybe three or four maximum are still hand harvesting (throughout the state)."
There are between 28 and 30 licensed harvesters in the state now, the bulk Down East and draggers. Nault said it's too hard to say whether farming outpaces wild harvesting these days.
In terms of poundage, mussels are the fifth-biggest fishery in Maine; still, they represent just 4 percent of the total catch, according to 2014 Department of Marine Resources data, way behind lobster (40 percent). And Nault is quick to point out that when it comes to value, mussels are way down the chain. They rank 11th behind oysters, urchins and -- oh the ignominy -- worms.
The dwindling number of wild mussels on Maine's shores troubles environmentalists, marine biologists and fishermen. It might be even more disturbing if it weren't for those thriving mussel farms.
But the steady decline in the intertidal zone also has an impact on coastal residents and visitors who wonder why the rocks seem so naked, why wading into their old swimming spots no longer involves navigating the hazards of sharp-shelled mussels growing fat in the flats. Or why Shaw's and Hannaford supermarkets have more mussels than Mere Point or Maquoit Bay.
Blue mussels have been, for these last decades of heavily regulated ocean resources, the people's seafood, the living food you could take home from the seashore along with sea glass and a sunburn.
Unregulated by municipalities, which claim clams, but not the less desired mussel in the intertidal zone, the mollusks are literally ours for the picking (provided no red tide has shut down the coastline). Or they were.
"It's always been that you could just go out at low tide and get some mussels," said Cathy Ramsdell, executive director of Friends of Casco Bay. "But you can't do that anymore, because you can't find them."
That vanishing act is the kind of thing that gets people worried. "A lot of us are thinking, what kind of time bomb is ticking?" Ramsdell added.
And so they call Ann Thayer and ask her to come over and look at their empty rocks with them. They ask their scientist friends. They call the Department of Marine Resources, which hasn't had the funding, or the manpower, to survey the mussel population for years.
"It's 150,000 intertidal acres," Nault said. "That is a near impossible task for myself and the other mussel specialist."
Nault said he hopes to partner with mussel harvesters and others to do aerial mapping of the beds next year, maybe pulling in students from area colleges. He wants answers, as well.
"As scientists we have to rule out everything," Nault said. "We can't just say, 'Oh, the green crabs got them.'"
Sorte's research in mussel populations extends beyond the Northeast; she's also working on studies of European, New Zealand and West Coast populations of the mollusk, as fast as she can.
"It is just a foundation species of rocky intertidal habitat through the world," Sorte said. "It's important because when it is gone, it is gone. And how will that affect the rest of the ocean community?"

Full text:   If I could see the weedy mussels Crusting the wrecked and rotting hulls
-- From "Exile" by Edna St. Vincent Millay
CASCO BAY -- The survey map in Ann Thayer's hand showed fat red splotches that wrapped around two-thirds of Bangs Island's shoreline, meaning that the intertidal zone -- the zone between the high and low water marks -- was supposed to be densely packed with mussel beds. The tide was nearly three hours past high, leaving plenty of rockweed exposed.
Thayer began systematically flipping over the weed, looking for mussels, aka Mytilus edulis, attached to the rock below.
"Nothing," she said. She said this over and over.
By the time she got back into her dinghy to row back to her Boston Whaler, she'd found only two mussels. Two where surveys from the 1970s and 1990s indicated there should be thousands, mollusks wedged into almost every nook and cranny in the rocks, the blue-hued shellfish nearly as commonplace as the barnacles living on their shells.
Thayer, who serves on the board of directors of Friends of Casco Bay, was not surprised by her findings.
They repeated what she's been seeing since 2013, when she started surveying, with the help of other volunteers, the dwindling mussel population of Casco Bay. More than half the surveyed sites have yielded no mussels where once there were plenty.
Up the coast, say in Hancock County, mussels can still be found in the intertidal zone. But another recently completed survey of 20 locations all along the state's coastline by Cascade Sorte, a former UMass Boston professor now at University of California Irvine, was equally disheartening. Sorte hasn't crunched all the numbers yet, but the problem seems to be across the board in Maine.
"It used to be that mussels were covering over half the space in the intertidal zone," Sorte said. "More than 50 percent of the space and now they are covering typically less than 10 percent. They have gone from this species that basically defined the rocky coastline to being a minor part of it."
Minor as in, nearly gone from the shores of Bangs Island. And here's the confusing bit: Maybe a 10-minute lazy breast stroke away is the Bangs Island Mussel Farm, where cultivated mussels grow on ropes stretching down into the cool sea.
They can grow on mussel farms, whether on the bottom or on ropes, but they aren't growing in the intertidal zone. There's enough seed, or spat, for farmers to grow them. But they're not ending up on shore the way they used to. The big mystery is why. Without knowing that, nothing can be reversed -- if in fact, it still can.
On this island trip -- she's taken many, and is always looking for new volunteers to help with the ongoing survey -- at least Thayer hadn't heard the noise.
"Scurrying," she said. "Last year you'd flip over the weed, and you'd hear the noise of the green crabs scuttling away."
She found three green crabs under the weed and immediately dispatched the one she managed to catch. No sense in leaving it alive; even if the crabs aren't the only culprit behind Maine's disappearing mussels, most consider them to be at least a part of the problem.
Other factors that are being considered by the sleuthing environmentalists and marine biologists working on this mystery include warming temperatures, ocean acidification, hungry eider ducks, predatory jellyfish eating the mussels in their larval stage, sea squirts, bacterial diseases, hard winters that rough up the intertidal zone, the impact of dragging on the mussel beds in past decades and changes to the substrate where mussels typically grow.
For every mussel expert you talk to, you'll hear a slightly different combination of which of these is doing the most harm.
If you look at the numbers game in that random August afternoon search on Bangs Island, you'd point to the green crabs, outnumbering mussels 3-to-2.
But Sorte, the professor who surveyed for mussels in 20 locations across the coast -- all the way to West Quoddy Head in Lubec -- between 2011 and 2014, said the groups she worked with did not see that many green crabs. "They have been seen as the culprits in a lot of locations, but we don't have early data to support that," Sorte said. (Her final data will be available in about six months.)
Thayer's volunteers occasionally do their surveying by boat or kayak, as well as on foot. Sorte's group, mostly graduate students looking for field experience, did all their surveying by foot, with a team of at least six. They would put down measuring tapes and count mussels at even intervals. Four of the sites had been surveyed before, 16 were new sites since Sorte hoped to establish a baseline where none had previously existed. In the past, when mussels were abundant and worries were scarce, no one was counting.
Still, Sorte doesn't dismiss the green crabs as a factor. Or fluctuating temperatures on either end. "There are issues with ice scour," she said. "That is where the sea water freezes, and then you have these rafts that are rubbing around the rocks."
"I don't think anyone really knows," said Carter Newell, founder of Pemaquid Mussel Farms, which has operations from Stonington to Lamoine. He also set up the original Bangs Island operation and served as a biologist for Great Eastern, the mussel producers who made the Maine mussel fashionable in the early 1980s, back when The New York Times dubbed them "the mollusk of the moment." "So everyone is going to pick their favorite theory, right?"
Or theories. Take Tollef Olson. He started Bangs Island Mussel Farm, sold that, got into kelp farming with Ocean Approved, recently sold that and is working on a new kelp-related product. He's also a surfer, and like Thayer, serves on the board of directors of Friends of Casco Bay. Warming ocean temperatures -- the Gulf of Maine is the fastest-warming body of ocean water in the world -- could be a factor. "Mussels do have a temperature range they are comfortable with."
He's unsure what role acidification may be playing but says it's less obvious than it is with soft-shell clams. "I haven't seen the pitting," he said, referring to the degradation of the clam's shell. He added that clams, sitting in the mud rather than on it, as many mussels tend to grow, are more vulnerable because they are "encapsulated in an acidic environment."
Studies have found a connection between ocean acidification, caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and the weakening of a key component to a mussel's survival, the byssal threads (fibers of protein) that the mussels use to attach to rocks, docks and even the ocean bottom.
The intense amount of dragging that happened in the 1980s is also likely to have had an impact, Olson said, both in disrupting the substrate the mussels need to develop beds and depleting the population. He's seen the evidence firsthand when he's been diving, looking for undiscovered beds. "Back then people weren't thinking that way," he said. "So I am not speaking badly about them. Sometimes you don't know the effect of overfishing until later."
Not to be forgotten, Olson says, are the green crabs and another predator that likes to feed on mussels. "I have seen a huge increase in the number of eider ducks," Olson said. "They were hunted up through the 1960s, really hard, and now they've made a comeback in the last 15 years."
"They can literally eat their weight in mussels in a day," he added.
Poet Mary Oliver wrote of gathering mussels "in barnacled fistfuls" in "Mussels" -- "I reach forward into the dampness, my hands feeling everywhere for the best, the biggest." She published that poem in 1977. That was the year after Phil Gray started reaching into the dampness, foraging and then making his living from mussel harvesting.
He'd grown up in central Maine, his dad working at a paper mill in Millinocket. The way the economy revolved around the paper industry made Gray long for something more. He was a young man, reading Euell Gibbons, and in 1976 decided to go to the coast, joking that he was "stalking the blue-eyed scallop." But the blue-shelled mussel turned out to be his main prey. "They were so plentiful," he marveled.
That was the beginning of the uptick in landings. In 1975, Maine fishermen brought in 3.59 million pounds of mussels in the shell. In 1976, that number went up to 7 million and by 1977, they harvested 12.4 million pounds. Others were dragging, but Gray liked hand harvesting. "I felt I could put out a better product."
The numbers continued to climb as Maine mussels grew in popularity until volumewise (but not valuewise) mussel landings were outpacing those of soft-shell clams.
In Gray's heyday, he'd get about 100 bushels of mussels, or 5,000 pounds in a week. These days he's lucky to get 50 pounds, which he sells at farmers markets in Brunswick.
"A couple of times I had to buy mussels," Gray said. Even that hasn't been easy. "I have actually ended up selling Prince Edward Island mussels."
He won't do that again, though; he'd prefer to harvest soft shells and increasingly quahogs, which have shells tough enough to resist the onslaught of green crabs and are still thriving. And he does have cause for optimism: he recently found a few small pockets of wild mussels in the waters off Harpswell, including "the largest set of wild mussels that I have seen in eight years."
They're larger than what he's used to seeing, and he thinks natural selection is very much at play in the shift in where the mussels live.
Gray, 68, believes himself to be the last harvester of wild mussels in southern Maine. He might be right, said Denis-Marc Nault, supervisor with the Maine Department of Marine Resources' Division of Shellfish Management. "Wild harvesters are fewer and farther in between," he said. "Maybe three or four maximum are still hand harvesting (throughout the state)."
There are between 28 and 30 licensed harvesters in the state now, the bulk Down East and draggers. Nault said it's too hard to say whether farming outpaces wild harvesting these days.
In terms of poundage, mussels are the fifth-biggest fishery in Maine; still, they represent just 4 percent of the total catch, according to 2014 Department of Marine Resources data, way behind lobster (40 percent).

Full text:   Pingree in delegation touring Ukraine
KIEV, Ukraine -- U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is continuing her overseas meeting in Ukraine.
The Maine Democrat is part of a congressional delegation that met Thursday with President Petro Poroshenko, the prime minister, members of parliament and others.
A day earlier, Pingree put flowers at a memorial at Maidan Square to honor demonstrators killed during political protests leading to the Ukrainian revolution of 2014.
Pingree said it's important that the U.S. retains a strong relationship "at this critical time for national security and in light of Russia's increasing aggression."
Ukrainian security officials renewed their request for U.S. weapons while meeting with the delegation. The U.S. has provided training and non-lethal aid, but has stopped short of supplying weapons to the Ukraine for its fight against Russian-backed separatists.
Authorities search for Long Island man
LONG ISLAND -- Authorities are asking for the public's help in their search for a Long Island man who has been missing since Sunday.
Cumberland County Lt. Donald Foss said 31-year-old Dana Moy left messages for his family and friends indicating that they would not find him alive.
Moy was last seen riding his bike Sunday on Long Island. Police said his boat, a white 2005 Carolina Skiff, was missing from its marina slip.
Foss said Moy stands at five feet and ten inches, weighs 185 pounds and has brown hair and blue eyes.
The Coast Guard and the Marine Patrol are assisting Cumberland County authorities in their search.
Coastal communities getting almost $250K
AUGUSTA -- Officials are giving out close to $250,000 for projects on Maine's coast that will support shellfish harvesting, increased public access and revitalizing downtowns.
The state is awarding grants to 11 projects. The largest grant is going to the town of Brunswick, which is receiving $47,925 for an assessment of the Mare Brook watershed.
Islesboro is getting $40,000 for determining vulnerability to sea level rise and storm surge in two locations. Oqunquit will get about $28,600 to address bacteria contamination in the Oqunquit River watershed.
The grant money comes from an award by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Each grant recipient is providing at least 25 percent in matching funds or services.

Full text:   Our Earth is very old. For more than 4 billion years, it has spun around its sun halfway to the edge of our spiral galaxy, sometimes boiling hot, sometimes sheathed in ice, sometimes wobbling a little, forever remarkable.
For the last 10,000 to 12,000 years (a mere blink of an eye, geologically speaking), a "long summer" of relatively stable climate has allowed humans to disperse all over the globe. Ultimately, small groups of hunter-gatherers paused, invented agriculture and produced a population explosion with civilization as we know it.
Now, however, that period of "climatic grace" is over. We humans have grown so powerful, so clever, and there are so many of us that we affect our entire planet. With rising carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution, last year was the warmest on record. Ice is melting rapidly in the Arctic, sea levels keep rising, the Gulf of Maine is warmer and more acidic, shellfish and coral reefs are suffering, lobsters are moving north along with ticks on land, and moose can't stand the heat. In other words, climate change is upon us.
So what can a person do in the face of it? As an artist who loves the Earth and its creatures, I paint. But instead of depicting the horrific mistakes of what human greed and carelessness have done, I show the irreplaceable beauty and mystery of our one-and-only home. I'm saying, "Look at it, love it, take care of it," and hope to raise awareness.
I recommend to anyone who is interested, a book, "The End of the Long Summer," by Dianne Dumanoski. It includes the story of how we humans actually cooperated to slow the growth of a dangerous ozone hole over the South Pole. After that, some people might join Sustain Mid-Maine Coalition (www.sustainmidmaine.org) or the Citizens Climate Lobby (CCL.org).

Full text:   for sauces, garnishes, flavorings
When I was growing up, the neighborhood kid with bright, reddish-orange locks was more likely to be referred to as a "carrot top" than any leafy green in my salad bowl was.
We had plenty of carrots growing in the garden and ate them readily, sometimes right out of the ground, with only a quick wipe across our T-shirts to clean them. But no, we didn't dare eat their lacy, leafed tops; we were told they were poisonous.
Turns out that old wives' tale was slightly misguided. While it is true that carrot tops contain alkaloids and nitrates to which some people can be sensitive, they aren't inherently toxic to most of us unless we eat them by the wheelbarrow-full. The confusion about the edibility of carrot tops seems to center on the fact that domesticated carrots have wild cousins that very much resemble poison hemlock. Confuse those two while foraging and you would almost certainly have a problem.
I didn't consider eating domesticated carrot leaves until about 10 years ago, when an organic farmer from whom I was buying carrots asked if she should cut the tops off into her compost bucket or did I want to bring them home for my culinary pleasure. Really? Use them like parsley -- scattered in salads, packed in green smoothies, simmered in stocks, and sprinkled as garnish over soups, was her advice. I made a carrot coriander soup garnished with oyster crackers that had been baked a second time after I coated them with butter, and minced carrot tops. Ever since, all of my summer carrots have had tops in tow.
Chef Chris Wilcox of The Velveteen Habit says carrot tops offer a range of flavors, from sweet and lettuce-like to pleasantly bitter herb. "When you find the young and tender ones, they actually taste a little like carrots," said Wilcox. He sometimes puts young tops pulled from the restaurant's own garden into the juicer to make a delicate green jus to accompany summer vegetable dishes. When the tops get a bit bigger, Wilcox notes, they become slightly bitter and work well as a second herb to basil in pesto, or paired with oregano in a salsa verde (recipe at left). Wilcox avoids cooking with carrot tops that measure longer than 6 inches because they are too bitter.
Wilcox admits that his garden produces many more carrot tops than he can use in his kitchen. The remainder go into the compost pile to help sustain future carrot crops.

Full text:   ROCKPORT -- They say food can be art, but sometimes art can be food.
Art can be onions or carrots, or even 5-year-old broccoli.
Yes, 5-year-old broccoli stalks, which, oddly enough, look like pieces of wood. Farmer/artist Jacinda Martinez pulled out a giant plastic tub filled with them in her basement studio.
"I'm always afraid when I open these that I've created a creature that's going to come out," Martinez joked as she lifted the lid off the tub.
Last year, Martinez sewed some of these stalks together vertically to make a midriff, then added a "skirt" of amaranth that still retained some of its scarlet color. The result was a stunning (if skimpy) outfit you might not wear to run errands, but it would look at home on the runway of a New York fashion show.
Martinez, 30, has been experimenting for six years with vegetables, both dried and fresh, that she gleans from farmers' fields, transforming them into works of wearable art. She turns them into designer outfits and then she photographs women modeling them.
Martinez started showing her work only last December, at an art show at Primo restaurant in Rockland, where she worked for three years as farm manager. In April, her photographs were part of a group exhibition at the Maine Farmland Trust Gallery in Belfast. And yesterday she displayed both photos and dresses at the Maine Fare food festival in Belfast and the Farmland Trust gallery.
Martinez has hand-sewn more than 40 pieces since she began playing with her food. Her portfolio includes photographs of a naked woman lying in a green field, covered in corn leaves. Another woman wears a dress made from dozens of chard soil blocks rescued from a flat left over after transplanting. A woman covered in tatsoi looks like a big, fluffy green poodle, as if her body exploded and out came the Asian greens.
Wound around another woman's neck are ropes of small green tomatoes that look like a necklace. "The front of this dress just kind of drapes loosely," Martinez said, "and then I thought, 'Oh, pearls ...'"
And, voila, some tomatoes that never ripened were transformed into ornament that would make an oyster proud.
What's the point? There are several, Martinez says. If you look at her work as just art for art's sake, it's a visual experience of color and texture. It's also a statement about the transient nature of life and the finicky nature of fashion. Living things eventually decay. Fashion comes and goes. More important to Martinez, it's an introduction to the idea of "slow fashion." Just as slow food asks you to think about what you put in your body (How long did it take the farmer to grow that stalk of celery in your salad?), slow fashion asks you to think about what you put on.
"If it's not synthetic, our fashion is essentially from the Earth," Martinez said. "You know, cotton farming is really one of the most intensive kinds of farming ever done, and yet do you think about that when you put it on your body?"
Her work is also just plain fun.
Anna Abaldo, curator at the Maine Farmland Trust Gallery, said while she knows "the fashion piece" is important to Martinez, she herself is more interested in the way the work illustrates the intimate connection between human and plant. She cited a review by critic Britta Koneau that said "the interaction between smooth skin and limp, crunchy, or prickly organic matter is visceral, almost invasive."
"There's a beautiful tension there," Abaldo said. "This is material that otherwise would be thrown away, or would never even reach the table, yet something very beautiful is made of it. There's layers in it for me of honoring the vegetable in its entirety, and with that, honoring where our food comes from."
Abaldo said Maine artists are at the forefront of using food and farming as material in their work. The Harlow Gallery in Hallowell, Waterfall Arts in Belfast and a group in Blue Hill have all developed initiatives focused on food. She suspects artists living in other states with strong local food movements, such as Vermont and California, are pursuing similar paths.
"The sense that I have is that more and more (Maine) artists are either finding this subject matter, or revealing themselves to be working with this subject matter," Abaldo continued, "and they're getting more and more eloquent and multi-layered in how they speak about it."
Martinez grew up in Bay Ridge, a blue-collar neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, where her mother runs a craft and fabric shop. Her father, who is from the Dominican Republic, works in the garment district in Manhattan.
Martinez attended college in Pennsylvania, where she took courses in photography, as well as basket weaving and other crafts. After graduation, she studied in England and then later went back to the United Kingdom on a work visa. She participated in a program called "World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms" through which she worked with Lise Bech, a Danish basket weaver who lives in Scotland.
"I was so enamored and inspired by the fact that she grew 12 varieties of her own willow, processed them onsite and then wove these extravagant, really massive basket structures," Martinez said. "We'd work all day outside in the garden and then come inside and weave some baskets. It began this whole process of full circle for me. It came from the Earth, you're harvesting it, creating it, and then it's just going to go back. As it came, it goes."
Back in the States, Martinez apprenticed at a New Jersey farm, where she began tinkering with turning vegetable matter into clothes. There was "mythological" chard growing "like, 6 feet tall" in the greenhouse that needed to be disposed of, "but my first thought was, 'Oh, this would be so beautiful draped on someone's body.'"
Using a housemate for a model, she designed a skirt and top from chard.
This year, Martinez started her own edible garden design and consulting business called Grounded Local, but she continues to work two days a week at Dooryard Farm in Camden, which helps keep her in materials. She makes eight to 12 outfits a year. Sometimes she works in an upstairs sewing nook, where she displays a 70-year-old sewing machine her father gave her. Sometimes she is in the basement studio, where she has a mannequin and a neutral backdrop for taking photos. Remnants of old outfits hang on the studio wall like sheaths of dried herbs in a barn.
Her photographs document everything: a dress made of three kinds of cabbage -- savoy, Chinese and smooth leaf; a skirt of nicotiana leaves with habanero peppers sewed around the waist like a string of Christmas lights and a matching habanero necklace.
Other materials in her agricultural toolbox include dried broccoli raab, braided salsify leaves, sweet potato roots, bolted scallions and dried, braided onion tops.
The dresses are usually wet when they're put on the models, which makes the material easier to work with.
Over the past six years, Martinez has learned which vegetables are fashion-friendly and which are not. Probably the most difficult to work with is garlic stems. She estimates the first garlic stem dress she made took 10 hours to sew.
"No matter how long you soak them, they don't really seem to become malleable," Martinez said, showing a visitor stems she had soaked in water dyed with marigolds for 24 hours. She was trying again, for a dress she was making for Maine Fare.
A dress made of rotting red cabbage that Martinez describes as "stunning, stunning, stunning" fell apart after the model moved her arm the wrong way during a photo shoot.
"I was, like, 'the dress has spoken,'" Martinez recalled. "Give it up. This isn't going to work. I spent so much time sewing this dress, and I have to let it go."
On the other hand, an outfit made of cucumbers -- a top that looks like the upper half of a bikini and bottoms that look like boy shorts -- held together surprisingly well.
Martinez isn't sure where this work is taking her; she only knows that she's not done yet.
"For now, I still really enjoy this," she said, "so I'm going to keep doing it."
Most recently, she has embarked on a "series within the series" called, simply, Decay. She's photographing a dress made of decaying bolted lettuce, taking new photos of it on the same model every three months.
But eventually, that dress, along with all the others, will end up in the same place.
The compost bin.

Full text:   to work against climate change
AS SPRING TURNS to summer, the Kennebec River comes back to life. Families are drawn to the playgrounds near the water's edge. Boaters once again explore the river's currents. Fish swim upstream. Eagle and osprey circle overhead.
Clean air, productive land and flowing waters sustain life in Maine and show us beauty and wonder that feed our souls.
As Catholics, we have a moral responsibility to steward and protect the "creation" that God so lovingly provides for us. After all, "And God saw that it was good." We also have an obligation to care for the poorest and most vulnerable among us.
We haven't always been diligent stewards, particularly when it comes to protecting our brothers and sisters from the impacts of environmental degradation and climate change. The damage of climate change is disproportionately felt by the poorest and most vulnerable -- like children and the elderly -- here in the U.S. and throughout the world, despite their having contributed least to the problem.
The health and economic impacts of carbon pollution and climate change in Maine are clear: Mainers suffer from one of the highest asthma rates in the country in part because of pollution from Midwestern coal-burning power plants; ticks have migrated north, bringing Lyme disease to our state; warming oceans have endangered our $5 million-a-year shrimp fishing industry; and more carbon in the Gulf of Maine has produced acidic waters that threaten the shells of clams, scallops and oysters.
In 2007, Pope Benedict eloquently said, "Preservation of the environment, promotion of sustainable development and particular attention to climate change are matters of grave concern for the entire human family."
Seventeen years before Benedict's words, Pope John Paul II devoted an entire speech to our moral responsibility to protect creation and the dignity of the human person, saying in 1990, "It is necessary ... that the entire human community -- individuals, states and international bodies -- take seriously the responsibility that is theirs."
Pope Francis echoes his predecessors, saying, "Creation is a gift, it is a wonderful gift that God has given us, so that we care for it and we use it for the benefit of all, always with great respect and gratitude."
This month, Pope Francis will clarify the church's ecological teachings through an encyclical -- an authoritative church doctrine -- to Catholics in Maine and around the world. The encyclical is a major event, signaling that the Catholic Church is putting climate change at the top of the church's agenda. It will underscore the moral obligation we have to future generations to address climate change and conserve our environment, especially because it affects the poorest and most vulnerable among us.
The Catholic Church encourages leaders around the world to prudently heed the warnings of nature and calls for action to protect and care for the earth and its inhabitants. Here in Maine, we have an opportunity to call upon our leaders to do just that.
As Catholics and as Mainers, we thank Maine's U.S. senators, Susan Collins and Angus King, and Rep. Chellie Pingree for taking loving care of God's creation and for their leadership in addressing climate change.
Maine has long been fortunate to have forward-thinking leaders who have passed innovative programs such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a highly successful, market-based approach to reducing carbon pollution.
We ask Maine's entire congressional delegation to heed the moral imperative to act on climate change and support the Clean Power Plan, which under the Clean Air Act proposes new standards to limit carbon pollution from power plants across the country. This plan would reward Maine for its climate leadership and ensure that we have fresh air to breathe by cleaning up the worst pollution in the Midwest and elsewhere in the U.S.
"If you did it for one of the least of my children, you did it for me," Jesus says in the Gospel of Matthew. We celebrate the Catholic Church's commitment to care for God's creation. We all bear the responsibility to steward and to value our environment for the good of this and future generations.
The Reverend Francis P. Morin is the pastor of St. Michael Parish, serving the greater Augusta and central Maine region. Maureen Drouin is a parishioner at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Hallowell and executive director of Maine Conservation Voters and Maine Conservation Alliance.

Full text:   BENTON -- A tractor-trailer carrying 30,000 pounds of live lobsters from Nova Scotia overturned early Wednesday morning on Interstate 95 southbound during whiteout conditions, according to the driver and state police.
The driver, Horst Puff, 55, of Greenfield, Nova Scotia, and his dog, Banjo, 10, were not injured in the crash, which occurred around midnight Tuesday as Puff tried to avoid striking a vehicle that had spun out in front of him, both he and state police Trooper Joseph Chretien said at the scene later Wednesday.
"I'm OK," Puff said, as he stood on I-95, his back against the wind. "There were dry roads from Bangor down to here. Everything was OK."
He said then there was blowing snow, whiteout conditions and a car in front of him. "The car hit the brakes. I hit the brakes," he said. "I saw nothing and came too far left and tipped over and Banjo went on top of me. He was on my chest."
The car that was in front of the truck never stopped, and the driver's identity is not known, police said.
The truck came to rest in the median about two miles north of exit 133 and near the Fairfield town line. There it stayed all day Wednesday, before it was finally removed around 7 p.m. The truck had to be righted with a crane, and the difficulty as well as the strong wind that blew all day delayed the move. Both southbound lanes were briefly closed for the removal.
Puff was driving the 2007 International truck owned by Gerhardt Trucking of Nova Scotia, taking the lobsters to wholesalers in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Rhode Island.
The lobsters, in 300 crates that weighed about 100 pounds each, survived the wreck and were being taken out of state following inspection by a state agriculture official, Chretien said.
At 11:15 a.m., before the lobsters were removed from the trailer, Chretien sat in the closed lane of I-95 as 42 mph winds whipped across the area known as Benton Flats, blowing snow into the road. Employees of Boulet's Truck Service worked to clear snow from around the overturned truck.
The southbound passing lane was closed to traffic as police awaited a flatbed truck that would carry the 300 crates of lobsters to Boulet's on U.S. Route 201 in Fairfield, Chretien said.
"The gusts are incredible right now," Chretien said after calling Waterville's LaFleur Municipal Airport to ascertain the wind speed.
Chretien said he got a call about the crash at 12:05 a.m. and arrived around 12:15 a.m.
He and Puff also had trouble getting Banjo out of the truck's cab.
"We were not able to get him through the door so we had to knock the windshield out," Chretien said. "It's a nice dog -- a very nice dog. He is fine." Puff said he got Banjo, a husky-Australian shepherd mix, from the humane society.
Chretien took Puff and Banjo to the Comfort Inn in Waterville, where they spent the rest of the night. He brought Puff back to the crash scene later Wednesday morning.
Chretien said traffic was moving fairly smoothly later in the day, but motorists were stopping on I-95 to take pictures, causing a dangerous situation.
"That's what my main concern right now is," he said during the afternoon.
The southbound passing lane of I-95 was closed for most the day, according to Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
At mid-afternoon, McCausland reported Chretien deemed the cab and trailer were likely damaged beyond repair. No charges are expected to be filed against Puff, according to McCausland.
Officials with the state Department of Transportation arrived after the crash and helped close the lane off to traffic and placed a large truck in the lane to protect the area.
"The DOT has just been fabulous," Chretien said.
Meanwhile, Banjo was being cared for Wednesday at the Boulet office in Fairfield, where Chris Michaud, who runs the parts department, was feeding him and taking him outside for walks.
"He's my surrogate son for the day," Michaud said.
The friendly brown and black dog with one brown eye and one blue eye was tied to Michaud's desk leg with an orange rope, but had plenty of room to move around. As employees walked to and from the shop through Michaud's office, they patted the dog.
"When they start a truck in the shop, he whimpers," Michaud said. "He thinks that his daddy is starting his truck."
Brian and Paul Boulet, owners of the business, said they have taken dogs in before that have been in accidents.
Brian Boulet said Gerhardt's, which owns the Nova Scotia truck, brought another trailer to load the lobsters into from Boulet's.
Gerhardt Trucking officials couldn't be reached by phone Wednesday.
Before the lobsters were taken to safety, they were worried about them freezing, Brian Boulet said. "They have to be between 35 and 40 degrees to live. That's what we were told by Gerhardt's."

Portland bar serves last call after 62 years

Abstract: The closure comes 10 months after the Portland City Council recommended against renewing its state liquor license based on the number of times police had been called to the area, including for a shooting outside the bar in January 2014. "There's plenty of yuppie bars," said Howard, who sipped on a can of PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon beer) while his wife drank a white Russian.

Full text:   The bar had run out of its popular Jell-O shots an hour earlier, when doorman Emerson Boxill was sweeping up broken glass on the floor and found a small plastic medicine cup filled with blue gelatin.
The lid on top was still sealed and that was enough for Chris Buerkle to pop it open, dig in with his pinky and lay claim to taking the last Jell-O shot Sangillo's Tavern ever served.
"Desperate times call for desperate measures," said his friend, Joe Watts.
After 62 years in operation and three generations of owners, the beloved neighborhood bar rang the brass bell mounted on the wall for its final "last call" just before 1 a.m. Sunday.
The jukebox, strong drinks, friendly people - and the alcohol-laced Jell-O cups - were hailed by the wall-to-wall crowd in the tiny wood-paneled bar tucked away on Hampshire Street in Portland.
The closure comes 10 months after the Portland City Council recommended against renewing its state liquor license based on the number of times police had been called to the area, including for a shooting outside the bar in January 2014.
The state's liquor board upheld the city's decision last month and the bar's owner decided not to appeal, meaning it would have to close in 30 days.
The time came early Sunday morning.
The Hampshire Street bar had been busy all week as the end approached, and it was busy as soon as it opened for the last time Saturday morning, said third-generation owner Dana Sangillo.
They came from all corners of the bar's eclectic clientele, which includes retirement-age regulars from the neighborhood, lobstermen coming off the ocean in the morning and servers who had just finished their work shifts at trendy restaurants nearby.
Some parked themselves at bar stools, savoring the final hours. Others came in for a drink or two to commemorate the closing.
Ashlee McLaughlin, 28, of Brunswick, said Sangillo's is usually where she ends a night of drinking in the Old Port. On Saturday, it was her first stop.
"Maybe it will be the last," she said.
McLaughlin said she likes the small bar because "it lacks a lot of the pretension that other bars have."
John Howard, 65, of South Portland agreed.
He and his wife had to cut their weekend in Bethel short because of the snowstorm, but he was glad it gave him the chance to visit the bar he's enjoyed over the years one more time. They kept their coats zipped up, sitting at a small counter by the door.
"There's plenty of yuppie bars," said Howard, who sipped on a can of PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon beer) while his wife drank a white Russian.
"I can go have a martini somewhere else," he said.
One of those places might be Eventide Oyster Co., a seafood and cocktails hot spot across the street - and the workplace of some of the most devoted Sangillo's customers.
Eventide owner Arlin Smith said Sangillo's has been more than a bar where cooks and servers go after work.
It's where they have birthday parties, hatch out business plans and say goodbye to parting employees.
"We cherish this. This is our safe haven," he said. "I don't know what we're going to do."
Jeff Crane, 51, who lives in the neighborhood, has also been at a loss. He comes into Sangillo's three times a week for rum and cokes.
"It's almost the only bar in Portland that's just a bar," he said.
It's not about watching sports or eating food here - unless, he said, "you count the Hot Pockets," an offering from the sparse snack menu.
"This is part of the community," said Crane.
As the end of the night approached, there was barely room to squeeze through the crowd to get to the bathroom or the bar. Two young women found extra space by standing on a bench that had been holding coats. They danced and chanted, "One more night."
Throughout the evening, glasses were raised and cellphones captured selfies to document the end of an era. The jukebox blasted everything from high-energy pop to sentimental country songs.
The hugs and tears didn't come until after last call.
For Mark Lee, the night was all about his mother, Andrea, a Sangillo's bartender for 37 years who died in November.
"If she was alive today, it would have killed her," he said about seeing the place close. "It was basically her life."
Dana Sangillo, the third generation owner, didn't know what to say, other than to offer his thanks for the support he's gotten.
"You see how much this means to so many people. It's humbling," he said.
Bartender Janessa Emmerton handed two handfuls of beer bottles to a customer over the bar when the clock struck 1 a.m.
She looked out to the crowd and swiped her hand across her neck.
"Done and done," she said.

Full text:   You may be able to hear them howling from the Capitol today. It's Dog Day at the Maine Legislature.
No, dogs are not allowed in the Capitol building. But the place will be full of dog lovers attending a public hearing on a bill to name the Labrador retriever our state dog. The bill is sponsored Sen. David Dutremble, D-Biddeford, at the request of a constituent, Stacy Gile of Wells.
"I certainly don't blame people for thinking, 'What do we need a state dog for?' Well, why don't we have one? We have all kinds of state symbols," Gile told Samantha Edwards of WLBZ TV. "We have the ones we all know about. We have the chickadee. We have the moose. We have the Maine coon cat. The cat gets their day, why can't the dog have theirs?"
This reminds me of my all-time-favorite legislative public hearing, on a bill sponsored by Sen. Paul Davis, R-Sangerville, to make the whoopie pie our state dessert.
The queen of whoopies, Amy Bouchard of Gardiner, creator of Isomax Wicked Whoopies, came up with the idea and filled the hearing room with whoopie pies. Certainly was the tastiest hearing ever.
Just like Dutremble with his dog bill, Davis was roundly criticized for "wasting the Legislature's time." Beth Quimby's Feb. 2 story in this newspaper quoted a woman from Arundel who said the Labrador bill "is stupid. There are so many other issues."
That woman misunderstands the legislative process. There is a lot of down time at the Legislature, for one thing, so legislators have plenty of opportunity for fun bills like this one. And the public gets most engaged in issues like this. We'll never fully understand tax reform bills, but boy, we can fire up on dogs.
Whoopie pies provide an important lesson for Dutremble and Gile. Maine's blueberry industry vigorously opposed naming the whoopie pie the state dessert. Legislators managed a compromise, naming the blueberry pie our state dessert and the whoopie pie our state treat. Brilliant. Now you have a good excuse to indulge in both.
And there is an economic benefit here. I don't know how many blueberry pies have been sold, but Bouchard has sold more than 30 million of her decadent and delicious Wicked Whoopies. That's not a typo -- 30 million.
Of course, there are more dogs than desserts in the running for state designation, so Giles will draw a whole lot of opposition. Support is growing for the Irish setter, the bull terrier, the Newfoundland, and even the bowser (part basenji, an African hunting breed, and Mexican chihuahua). Quimby reported that Andrew Parker of South Portland suggested a rescue dog, to "show how kind-hearted Mainers are."
If Parker attends the public hearing on the dog bill, kind-heartedness may not be in evidence. It is sure to be a howling good debate, but in my experience, nothing stirs up people like arguments about pets.
I can help Gile with one argument being made against her bill -- that the Lab has no strong connection to the state. Well, Moxie is our state drink, and it is produced in South Carolina.
In 2011, during the wicked good whoopie debate, I wrote a column proposing other state designations including the state sport (complaining) and the state liquor store (Portsmouth). And can you believe our state shellfish is not the lobster? OK, I'm complaining.
I proposed Stephen King as our state author. I sat next to Steve in freshman creative writing class at the University of Maine. At my book talks, I like to say we both became writers, and we've sold 300 million books.
If you insist that state designations should be created here, let's go with these. State mustard: Raye's, still made with the old grindstone in Eastport. State flour: Maine Grains from the Somerset Grist Mill.
State boot: I'll bet I don't have to tell you what this is, especially if you tried to buy a pair of L.L. Bean boots for Christmas and were told you couldn't get a pair until April.
And wouldn't it be fun to launch a discussion (OK, an argument) about a state vegetable? Are goose tongue greens a vegetable? They would be my choice. I am certain the fiddlehead folks will disagree. Tomatoes, anyone?
Alabama has a state nut. Now wouldn't that debate be interesting.
Finally, let's designate our state's favorite fun activity. I am pretty sure it will not be debating issues before the Legislature. Woof! Woof! Woof!

Abstract: An exact number is hard to come by, but Trisha Cheney of the Department of Marine Resources estimated that during the heyday of the scallop fishery, which peaked in 1981 with a 3.8 million-pound catch, most of the state's 1,200 urchin divers also harvested scallops and more divers were harvesting scallops alone. Scallop diving, said Nick Branchina, director of marketing for Browne Trading Co. in Portland, is "the epitome of the absolute best practice," in terms of impact on the marine resource and quality of the product.

Full text:   A t 42, Jamie Sewell is one of the youngest of the 85 commercially licensed scallop divers left in Maine. Supposedly there's another guy who is 41, but Sewell doesn't know him. All he knows is, he counts for young in a dwindling if not dying business.
These are tough guys (and at this point, no women hold commercial licenses to scallop dive). There are a lot of ways one could explain that: the plunge into wintery waters of, say, 37 degrees, the even colder temperatures on deck, the solitary nature of this form of fishing. But Sewell? If ever there were a way to take the measure of a man's toughness it would be Sewell. He was in a snowmobile accident in 2009, and it cost him dearly.
"When I lost my arm, (diving) was one of the easier things to pick back up," Sewell said. He's been right-handed all his life, but under the water, where he is weightless and made graceful by the pressure of the sea, he always found it easier to hold his mesh collection bag in his right hand and pick up the scallops with his left. Now, without his right arm, he still does that, anchoring the bag on his prosthetic. "It came back more natural than a lot of things."
Just three decades ago, hundreds of people regularly plunged into frigid Maine waters to make a living in the hunt for scallops. An exact number is hard to come by, but Trisha Cheney of the Department of Marine Resources estimated that during the heyday of the scallop fishery, which peaked in 1981 with a 3.8 million-pound catch, most of the state's 1,200 urchin divers also harvested scallops and more divers were harvesting scallops alone.
In 2013, 85 people held commercial scallop diving licenses. Only about 33 people are thought to be actively using them. The decline reflects a loss of a Maine way of life. It also has implications for a troubled but rebounding scallop fishery.
Of all the ways one can harvest from the ocean, marine resource experts and wholesalers say that diving is the closest thing to a zero-impact fishery. The vast majority of scallop fishing in Maine is done in inland waters by boats that drag the ocean floor with weighted nets. Of the 548 commercial draggers licensed in 2013, about 400 of them were active, according to Cheney. Divers who don dry suits and carry tanks of air on their back bring in less than 10 percent of the state's harvest by handpicking scallops off the ocean bottom or plucking them out of the water at depths that range from about 50 to 100 feet.
Scallop diving, said Nick Branchina, director of marketing for Browne Trading Co. in Portland, is "the epitome of the absolute best practice," in terms of impact on the marine resource and quality of the product.
That's not to say that day boat scallops, as the product from dragging in Maine is called, aren't a very fine product as well, he said, diplomatically.
Diver scallops are cleaner, since no mud is stirred up in the process, and they command a premium. It's not unheard of for a New York restaurant to pay $35 to $50 per pound for them, he said. Browne Trading packages diver scallops in tins that bear the name of the individual who caught them, a tribute to the effort that went into the harvest.
"It's almost an art form," Branchina said.
In 2005, the scallop fishery bottomed out, with only 33,000 pounds landed. Three years later, the Legislature voted to put the brakes on new permits. Hundreds of people rushed to get a license before the cutoff took effect, Cheney said. Since then, the number of active divers has dropped steadily, as license holders die or give up their licenses, many prompted by wear on the body or dangers of the job.
"Only the best of the best are left," said Marcus Jones, a scallop diver from Steuben who is on the state Scallop Advisory Council. "We're all die-hards. I just turned 50 last weekend. Age is weeding us out. I am hoping this is my last year."
Donnie Freeman, of Phippsburg, called to answer a reporter's question from the back of a boat near Cheabeauge. His suit was leaking. "About half wet," he stood next to the heater as he talked.
There is nothing like the proximity to nature that divers like Freeman experience.
"I love seeing different things on the bottom," Freeman said. "I come across old bottles and stuff people haven't seen for 100 years."
Then, there is the taste of a prey that still quivers.
"I don't even bring a lunch," Freeman said. "I just eat a scallop right out of the shell."
But the list of pitfalls could scare off Hercules.
"I've been caught in currents and dragged," said Brian Preney, 55, a diver out of Boothbay who is a member of the Urchin Advisory Council and has been fishing with scuba gear since 1980. He learned how to dive at Colby College, in the pool, and married into a family of fishermen. Fishing for urchins, which generally don't take a diver below 30 feet, is like "picking cotton" in comparison to the more exciting pursuit of scallops, which have the power to dart away, fast. "I liken scalloping more to hunting."
With a forest far more treacherous to find one's way out of. "I ran out of air at 90 feet once," or started to, Preney remembered. The visibility was bad at that depth. Preney dropped his bag of scallops, lost air entirely at 30 feet and counted himself lucky to reach the surface, where his boat - small and entirely open to the elements - was waiting. "If you don't panic, you're going to make it," he said. Did he go back for the bag? "Definitely."
Under the regulations that began to be put in place after the scallop fishery crashed, both draggers and divers are limited to the same catch every day: 15 gallons. Divers say it is rare that they take that much. Preney's bonanza day was about 14 gallons or 120 pounds. Eight gallons is generally a good day.
Virtually every fishery in Maine, outside of lobsters, is under pressure. The shrimp season has been canceled for two seasons, intensifying the need to make money elsewhere.
With all this pressure comes "one of the biggest elephants in the room that I have had to manage," Cheney said, alluding to the dispute between draggers and divers about what is fair and who is responsible for depleted scallops. It comes down to a basic argument: Draggers blame divers for removing seed, or immature, scallops and brood stock, those ripe for reproduction; divers blame draggers for damaging the bottom, leaving dead scallops and lobsters in their wake, and tearing up the kelp. "I would never even set foot on a dragger," Freeman said. "After I see what they do to the bottom, I don't have much respect for what they do."
Dragging is the traditional form of harvesting scallops in Maine. In January 1929, the New York Times reported on "the interesting fishery" that had 35 boats dragging in Penobscot Bay. Diving for scallops didn't come along until the 1970s, when the invention of dry suits made it possible. Bob Steneck of the UMaine School of the Marine Sciences and the Darling Marine Center was there at the beginning. After research dives, he'd fill a mesh bag with scallops, a treat to follow a day under water. There were scallops everywhere then, within an arm's reach. "Back then I was not alone in thinking this resource seemed almost unlimited and as far as the eye could see," Steneck said. "Obviously I was dead wrong about that."
Steneck sees both sides of the argument. Scallops live primarily in a sedimentary bottom, where the breakdown of crustaceans and other deposits create a mat of sorts, and that's valuable because it gives the sea floor more coherence.
"That gets violated when it gets dragged," Steneck said. "That's not great for the scallops."
On the other hand, Steneck theorized that divers might threaten the biodiversity of an area, plucking all the scallops that are particular to the Sheepscot River or Muscongus Bay. Or, if they didn't care about the resource, by simply taking everything they see in an area. A dragger, he points out, can't get everything; a net doesn't have a set of eyes on it. Divers laugh at this notion. They would never imperil the resource or be able to in the time their air supply or the conditions allot, they say.
"I don't see a perfect way of going forward," Steneck said.
To the outnumbered divers, it seems unfair that the state holds them to the same standards as the more efficient draggers. Regardless of what gear they use, both groups are limited to scalloping over 70 days, spread out over four months, and are allowed to take 15 gallons a day.
Brian Preney talks about diving while a dragger worked 200 yards away, across an area "twice the size of a Shaw's supermarket."
"Just the repetitive beating he was giving that bottom, ... it's what they do," he said. "It's brutal."
Cheney finds this debate unconstructive, one that has existed since the beginning of scallop diving in Maine. She said she recently picked up a 1980 copy of National Fisherman and found a dragger-versus-diver story in it. "It's been the narrative for 35 years," she said.
Yet the fishery is rebounding. She expects a catch of a half-million pounds this year. And the conservation efforts of draggers, including switching to less closely knit nets that allow smaller scallops to slip through and mature, have helped.
"The fishery has been rebuilt on the back of draggers," she said.
Cheney hopes the Department of Marine Resources one day will be able to re-open the licensing program.
"We do have to come up with some type of re-entry plan for people," she said. "We have a whole generation that has missed access to the fishery."
A new plan wouldn't necessarily favor divers, however. The divers' work is important and low-impact, Cheney said. "But to expect the whole coastline to be harvested by divers is just not a reality."
Diving for scallops is a slower, harder way of doing things. If it has less impact on the ocean floor, some say, that should count for something.
"What I'm doing is better," Sewell said. "So why aren't they treating me better? I just wish they'd be more lenient with us. ... It's hard enough as it is."

Full text:   David Anthony peered over the side of his boat toward the engine and saw the flames.
At that point, he knew there wasn't much of a choice to make.
"I knew we had to go over," he said.
What was supposed to be a routine day of pulling up lobster traps for the season turned into a harrowing few hours Tuesday for the 47-year-old Vinalhaven lobsterman and his son and sternman, Blake, 21.
The two escaped the fire by jumping into the icy water and then swam an estimated 300 to 400 feet to the nearest shore, Cedar Island, just west of Vinalhaven, a Knox County island of about 1,100 year-round residents.
Both father and son were treated late Tuesday afternoon at a medical center on Vinalhaven but were sent home by dinnertime.
"I didn't eat a whole lot," David said Wednesday by phone from his home. "But I guess we were pretty lucky."
The Anthonys set out Tuesday morning from Vinalhaven in a 25-foot lobster boat they called Midnight Rider. They had planned to pull up as many lobster traps as they could to store for the winter.
Just minutes after leaving the island, the fuel pump failed. Luckily, Anthony had a spare.
"So I changed the pump, but there was a leak," he said. "So we shut everything down, fixed the leak and went on our way."
They hauled for about an hour or so. Then Anthony began to smell gas -- strongly.
He looked toward the engine and saw flames shooting out.
"We didn't even have time to get our survival suits," he said.
Anthony instructed his son to jump into the water, and then he did the same. But before he left the boat, Anthony cut free a lobster buoy that was mounted on the interior of his boat. That quick thinking might have saved their lives.
"If we didn't have that one buoy to hang on to, I don't think we would have made it," he said.
The two men swam toward the closest shore, Cedar Island, pausing regularly to hold their heads above water with the buoy's help.
"The water was calm, thank God," Anthony said. "It wasn't warm by any means, but it wasn't as bad as I expected."
They reached land and huddled together on an outcrop of rocks. David was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt. Blake had shed his pants and was wearing only underwear and a long-sleeve T-shirt. They had been in the 47-degree water for about 45 minutes.
Neither man had time to radio for help, but the flames from the boat's engine spread to the 44 traps that were on board, and soon other fisherman could see the fire.
A Maine Marine Patrol boat out of Rockland responded and was met by another boat that carried fire and rescue personnel from Vinalhaven.
The Anthonys were shivering but otherwise OK.
"That's a really dangerous situation, even though they were relatively close to shore," said Jeff Nichols, spokesman for the Marine Patrol. "Even a short stint in water can be dangerous this time of year."
Anthony, who has been lobstering his whole life, said his boat "burned to the water line," and the 44 traps were "incinerated."
He has another boat, a 32-footer that he said needs some work before its sea-ready, and he has another 250 or so traps still buoyed off Vinalhaven.
"I want to fish next year, but I may get a later start," Anthony said, pausing to reflect once more on the fact that he and his son are fortunate enough to have the chance to fish again. "Our lives were definitely in jeopardy, no question about it."

Full text:   Hong Kong police dismantle protest site

HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's leader Monday declared the end of pro- democracy protests that blocked the city's roads for more than 11 weeks, as police cleared the last demonstration site.
Cars and trams returned to areas of the popular Causeway Bay shopping district that had been taken over by protesters, after police officers dismantled barricades and took down tents. More than 10 demonstrators, including lawmaker Kenneth Chan, were taken away by police as they refused to leave and staged a sit-in.
The street protests were kick-started on Sept. 26 when student leaders stormed the premises of the government headquarters and drew as many as 100,000 people after the police used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the demonstrators on Sept. 28. It became the biggest challenge to China's rule over Hong Kong since it resumed sovereignty over the former British colony in 1997.
Demonstrators had demanded China reverse its decision to vet chief executive candidates for city's first leadership election in 2017 through a nominating committee, a mechanism the pro-democracy camp said will only select prospective leaders favored by Beijing.
Ebola debt forgiveness sought by UN panel
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia -- A U.N. commission is asking for more debt cancellations for the three West African nations hardest hit by the Ebola virus.
The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa said Monday that it is crucial that the current Ebola health crisis not be a catalyst for financial distress in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.
A new report on the socio-economic impact of Ebola said the overall impact on Africa should be minimal because the three countries account for only 0.68 percent of Africa's GDP. The report estimates that Ebola's impact on the continent's GDP levels in 2014 and 2015 will be only -0.19 percent and -0.15 percent.
Shark kills Australian on Great Barrier Reef
BRISBANE, Australia -- An 18-year-old man was killed by a shark on Monday while spearfishing on the Great Barrier Reef off the eastern Australian tourist town of Port Douglas, police said.
It was the first fatal shark attack in Australia since September, when a 50-year-old swimmer was killed at popular Byron Bay, 1,000 miles to the south.
In the latest attack, the man from the nearby town of Mossman was mauled while fishing with friends off Rudder Reef, police said in a statement. He was pronounced dead after his friends brought him to shore by boat.
He sustained massive injuries to his right upper leg, right groin and right upper arm, Queensland state Ambulance Service spokesman Greg Thiedecke said.
Herpes virus wiping out oysters worldwide
MELBOURNE, Australia -- Herpes has devastated 26 percent of France's oyster production since the summer of 2008. Halfway around the world in Australia, the virus killed 10 million oysters in three days.
Researchers suspect climate change risks compounding the losses.
The $4.1 billion global industry is grappling with a herpes virus that can have a 100 percent mortality rate. In Europe, the virus starts killing oysters when water temperatures reach about 61 degrees Fahrenheit.
Combined land and ocean surface temperatures have warmed 0.85 of a degree Celsius since 1880, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all parts of the climate system, it said in a 2014 report.
Temperatures this year are on course for their highest globally since records began, with oceans bearing the brunt of the heat and the United States and Canada spared the worst, says the World Meteorological Organization.
US Marine charged in transgender slaying
MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine government prosecutors charged a U.S. Marine with murder Monday in the killing of a Filipino, saying the suspect acknowledged attacking the victim after he found out she was a transgender woman.
Prosecutor Emilie de los Santos said there was "probable cause" that Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton, who has been detained since shortly after the October incident, killed Jennifer Laude, whose former name was Jeffrey, in the motel room where the victim's body was found in Olongapo city, northwest of Manila. She had apparently been strangled and drowned in a toilet bowl.

Islamic fighters capture 2 bases in Syria
BEIRUT -- Al-Qaida-linked and other Islamic fighters captured two key Syrian army bases on Monday in the northwestern province of Idlib after two days of intense battles with government troops that killed dozens on both sides, activists said.
The fall of the two bases -- Wadi Deif and Hamidiyeh, both located near the town of Maaret al-Numan -- is a significant blow to the Syrian army, which had managed to hold on to them for more than two years, repelling repeated attacks by an array of opposition groups.
The battles for "these two bases were exhausting the rebel factions," said Hussam Abu Bakr, a spokesman for the ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham group, one of the strongest rebel factions in northern Syria. He said his group captured Hamidiyeh base.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and an Idlib-based activist who goes by the name of Mohammed al-Sayid said members of the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front and other rebel factions captured the Wadi Deif base Monday morning and the nearby Hamidiyeh base in the early afternoon.
Abu Bakr told The Associated Press via Skype that government forces first withdrew from Wadi Deif to Hamidiyeh and then from Hamidiyeh to the nearby village of Bsida.
Then, the rebels captured Bsida, forcing government forces to gather in the village of Maar Hattat, which is now being besieged, said Abu Bakr. "There are more deaths and more prisoners every hour," he added.
State-run Syrian TV said Syrian armed forces were engaged in fierce battles in Hamidiyeh after "carrying out a redeployment" in the Wadi Deif region Monday morning. It did not elaborate.
The Observatory said that at least 31 government soldiers and 12 opposition fighters have been killed in the clashes since Sunday. The group, which tracks the fighting in Syria through a network of activists on the ground, said that rebel factions also captured about 15 government troops.
Government forces have suffered enormous losses at the hands of Islamic extremists in northern Syria. Earlier this year, members of the Islamic State group took over a string of government air bases in the northern province of Raqqa, slaughtering scores of Syrian soldiers after seizing them.
A Twitter account run by the Nusra Front in Idlib province said fighters are now removing mines from the area after the "Wadi Deif camp was liberated."
Rebels and the Nusra Front control much of the countryside of Idlib province while government forces dominate the provincial capital - also called Idlib.
The capture of the bases came a day after rebels and Nusra Front fighters took over seven government checkpoints around Wadi Deif and Hamidiyeh.
Idlib-based activist Asaad Kanjo said the government still holds the town of Ariha in Idlib as well as the Qarmid base near the provincial capital.
The Nusra Front has become one of the most powerful factions in Idlib province after it last month defeated the moderate Syria Revolutionaries Front headed by Jamal Maarouf, who has since fled the area.
The latest round of fighting came as European Union foreign ministers met in Brussels on Monday to discuss ways to help implement a U.N. plan for a localized cease-fire in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. They pledged their assistance to help rebuild basic services and local government in the city if a plan proposed by U.N. special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, to halt the fighting there can be implemented.
The U.N. has been trying to bring about a strategic de-escalation of violence in Syria to permit the delivery of humanitarian aid and set the stage for peace talks.
In what was described as a policy change, Federica Mogherini, the bloc's foreign policy chief, said later Monday that the ministers went on record in a statement as being `'ready to engage with all regional and international actors with influence over the Syrian parties."
She told reporters later that specifically meant Saudi Arabia and Iran, as well as Russia - one of Assad's closest allies.
"There could be a good chance for Russia to play a positive role in the region," stressed Mogherini.
Associated Press writer John-Thor Dahlburg contributed to this report from Brussels.

Full text:   Five US ambulances sent to aid Ebola fight
FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- The United States donated five ambulances Wednesday to help Sierra Leone's fight against Ebola as the West African government acknowledged it can take up to 24 hours to pick up bodies in the spiraling crisis.
More than 2,200 deaths throughout West Africa have been attributed to Ebola amid the worst outbreak of the disease in history. The sick have been using motorcycle taxis and other public transport to get to hospitals, further increasing the risk of transmitting the disease that kills about half its victims.
The U.S. has spent more than $100 million responding to the outbreak.
Also on Wednesday, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced it will spend $50 million -- on top of $10 million already committed -- to support emergency response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. It is the group's largest donation to a humanitarian effort.
The Seattle-based foundation said the money will go to the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other international organizations.
Flooding river surges toward Pakistan city
JHANG, Pakistan -- Raging monsoon floods across India and Pakistan that have killed more than 450 people poured into the plains of eastern Punjab province on Wednesday, sending a major river over its banks and threatening to force hundreds of thousands from their homes.
The Chenab River overflowed early Wednesday, threatening the nearby Pakistani district of Jhang in the worst flooding in the region in years.
The flooding began earlier this month in Kashmir, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan. It caused landslides and submerged much of the city of Srinagar on the Indian-administered side. The water is now rushing out of the mountains of the Himalayan region, affecting communities downstream and threatening to force nearly 700,000 people from their homes.
Ozone layer returning, UN scientists say
WASHINGTON -- Earth's protective but fragile ozone layer is beginning to recover, largely because of the phase-out since the 1980s of certain chemicals used in refrigerants and aerosol cans, a U.N. scientific panel reported Wednesday in a rare piece of good news about the health of the planet.
Scientists said the development demonstrates that when the world comes together, it can counteract a brewing ecological crisis.
For the first time in 35 years, scientists were able to confirm a statistically significant and sustained increase in stratospheric ozone, which shields us from solar radiation that causes skin cancer, crop damage and other problems. From 2000 to 2013, ozone levels went up 4 percent in the key mid-northern latitudes at about 30 miles high.
Carbon dioxide growth fastest in 30 years
Carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere reached a record high last year and grew at the fastest rate in 30 years, the United Nations' climate agency reported Tuesday.
The World Meteorological Organization's latest Greenhouse Gas Bulletin "injected even greater urgency into the need for concerted international action against accelerating and potentially devastating climate change," the U.N. agency said.
The concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide increased last year by 2.9 ppm, or parts per million, to 396 ppm, the biggest annual increase since 1984, WMO said. Some climate scientists believe concentrations below 350 ppm to be relatively safe, but that is a level not seen since 1987.
The oceans take up about 8.8 pounds of carbon dioxide per person per day, the report said. Increased acidification alters "calcifying organisms" like coral and mollusks, and reduces the survival and growth rates of other aquatic species.
Subway shooter Goetz has pot case dismissed

NEW YORK -- A low-level marijuana case against 1980s subway shooter Bernie Goetz has been dismissed after a judge concluded the clock ran out for trying it.
Goetz, 65, was busted in December on charges he sold $30 worth of marijuana to an undercover officer in Union Square park. He was offered a plea deal involving 10 days of community service. Goetz rejected it, saying he felt coerced into taking the money.
In 1984, Goetz was branded the "subway vigilante" when he shot four black teens with an illegal handgun on a No. 2 train in Manhattan. At least one had a screwdriver, and they were asking him for $5. He was cleared of attempted murder charges and spent 250 days in jail in 1987 for a weapons conviction in the case.
Compiled from wire reports
Goetz said it was self-defense and the youths intended to mug him. One of the teens was paralyzed.
The bulletin compiles assessments of annual concentration of the three most enduring greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- which are blamed for 88 percent of the increase in global temperature, WMO said.
A report last month in the journal Global Change Biology said that ocean acidification due to increased carbon dioxide is interfering with the sense of smell in some species of sharks, inhibiting their ability to find and attack prey.
Witness describes shooting at Iowa courthouse

DES MOINES, Iowa -- An Iowa man who was killed during a public meeting shot at a county official despite numerous pleas from a group to put the gun down, a witness said Wednesday.
Francis Glaser pulled a handgun from a briefcase Tuesday as a group prepared to leave a recently adjourned county supervisors meeting at the Jackson County Courthouse in Maquoketa. Glaser demanded the meeting resume so officials could discuss his rising property taxes, said county Supervisor Jack Willey.
"All of us said, `Gus, no, this isn't the way to deal with this. Put the gun down. Put the gun down,"' he said while referencing Glaser's nickname.
Glaser, 71, had become agitated during the meeting.
"We noticed as the meeting was going on that the coloring that Gus had, usually when people get mad, they turn red. But he didn't turn red. It was like the blood was draining from him. He was just turning white as a ghost," he said.
Despite the pleas, Glaser shot once at County Assessor Deb Lane and missed. Larry Koos, another county supervisor, tackled Glaser to the floor. Others helped keep him down.
During the scuffle, a second shot was fired, hitting Glaser. Authorities arrived and pronounced him dead at the scene.
Willey said he keeps reliving the scene.
"Deb was obviously his target," he said. "When you think back, if he had got her on the first shot, he wasn't happy with us either. Who knows where the gun would have been pointed next."

Full text:   There's a great big target on the backs of predator green crabs now, thanks to rule changes by the Maine Department of Marine Resources that went into effect this week.
As of Aug. 10, commercial fishermen no longer will need a special license to harvest and sell green crabs, and they won't have to report their green crab harvests to the DMR. Lobstermen will be allowed to take them as bycatch. And when the Sheepscot, Damariscotta and Medomak rivers are closed for fishing other species of crabs between Dec. 1 and April 30, fishermen still will be able to harvest green crabs from those waters.
The efforts to increase the harvest of green crabs are part of a raft of public and private efforts underway to rid Maine's coastal waters of the invasive species, which prey on the state's valuable shellfish population and wreak havoc on eel grass. Although the critters, which can be anywhere from two-and-a-half to 5 inches long, have been reported in Maine for more than a century, scientists speculate that warming ocean temperatures have allowed the crabs to multiply.
The crabs feast on bivalves such as softshell clams, which are Maine's third-most-lucrative fishery. In 2013, 10.6 million pounds of softshell clams were valued at $16.9 million. But that was down from 11.1 million landed in 2012, according to the DMR, a decline partly attributable to damage from green crabs.
In December, hundreds of researchers gathered at the University of Maine in Orono to discuss the issue at a Green Crab Summit. In February, Gov. Paul LePage ordered the creation of a task force to study their effect and potential solutions. A a result, Brunswick, Freeport, West Bath and Harpswell are studying the most effective ways to trap green crabs.
As awareness about the problem has grown, so has the effort to harvest crabs. In 2013, there were 52 licenses to fish green crabs, and 10,596 pounds were harvested, according to preliminary data from the DMR. The year before, 36 licenses were issued and 3,762 pounds landed.
Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are exploring opportunities to turn the predators into profits by marketing green crabs for everything from fish food to gourmet meals.
"The rule changes certainly makes things easier," said Dan Devereaux, a Marine Resources Officer in Brunswick.
Since 2012, he's seen a decline in softshell clams that he directly attributes to the increase in green crabs. As a result, he reduced the town's number of commercial shellfish licenses from 57 to 50, and anticipates more reductions going forward. He told state officials during public hearings about the rule changes that Brunswick has scrambled to purchase traps to harvest green crabs, describing their predation as "a serious threat to the shellfish resource, marine ecosystem and economic environment not only for Brunswick but for all other coastal communities."
In the last year, researchers have been working at monitoring the green crab population with an eye toward managing it.
Marine biologist Darcie Couture, who is studying the green crabs in Brunswick and Harspwell, said that her team saw the population of green crabs peak in July. The catch now is starting to taper off closer to shore, but in deep waters off of Harpswell, the harvests are still large.
"We're still pulling out hundreds of pounds each week," said Couture, a signal to her that there's a sustainable population in deep water. Last year they didn't see green crab catch numbers fall until winter.
The hope is that the pattern that's emerging this year will repeat itself next year so researchers can identify a distinct "green crab season." That would allow fishermen and towns to prepare for it by putting traps in strategic places to protect their shellfish resources in the spring, and keep traps there until the end of the season.
"Once we identify a pattern, towns can make this an ingrained part of their management strategy," she said. "We don't have a complete understanding of what the season is yet. We're just starting to build that data set."
Brian Beal, a marine ecology researcher at the University of Maine at Machias, has been doing a series of studies in Freeport, tracking crabs and assessing how they're affecting clams in the area.
In Freeport, the green crab catch is below levels they saw last year, and the weight of the average catch per trap is less than 1 pound.
Couture said the attention has spawned a stream of calls from entrepreneurs who are looking at potential new markets for the pesky creatures. Some are looking for new ways to process the crabs to capture their meat and others are looking at new uses for their shells and other components.
"We haven't seen any leaps in progress, but that's a path that remains open," Couture said. "We'll continue to work with anyone who is interested in trying to find a commercial use."
Margaret Harrington, manager of Harrington Bait in Woolwich, hopes that one of those commercial uses will be bait. Her store sells bloodworms and sandworms, and she sees a steady demand from fishermen who want green crab as bait. If there's a viable market, she said, she would consider building a processing operation.
"We're always interested in expanding what we're able to sell," she said.

Full text:   The regional head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said New England's market-based approach to reducing carbon dioxide emissions shows that states can fight climate change while still improving the economy.
Curt Spalding, EPA administrator for New England, suggested that Maine and most other Northeastern states already had compiled a "toolbox of tools" to meet proposed EPA rules for slashing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants nationwide. The goal now, Spalding said, is to put in place a national framework flexible enough to work in all states.
"What this rule tries to do ... is to take advantage of the building blocks that have been put in place in places like New England," Spalding told several dozen people in a University of Southern Maine lecture hall.
Spalding spoke about the EPA's proposed carbon standards for power plants during an unofficial "listening session" in Portland organized by the Natural Resources Council of Maine, the Island Institute and the Voter Education Brigade. "The first goal is to get the framework in place so that the kinds of continuous improvement experience we've had here in New England can happen everywhere," Spalding said.
Spalding noted that New England's gross domestic product has increased 22 percent since 1999, while carbon emissions have declined 20 percent.
In June, the EPA unveiled proposed rules that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 as part of the Obama administration's effort to reduce greenhouse gas pollution linked to climate change. Each state was given a different target, with Maine expected to reduce emissions by 13.5 percent by 2030.
The EPA is still discussing technical details of how New England's existing carbon emission reduction system -- the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI -- will mesh with the proposed state-by-state emissions reductions slated to take effect in 2020. However, Spalding said the proposed rules were designed to be flexible and should enhance existing programs such as RGGI.
Spalding was in Maine days after a dozen other states filed a lawsuit challenging the EPA proposal and roughly one week after several thousand people attended public hearings held in four cities around the country. Speakers at those public hearings were deeply divided with the strongest opposition coming from coal country and areas where coal is the dominant source of fuel for power plants.
The crowd at Portland's unofficial "listening session" was decidedly friendly. Speakers warned that a warming climate was already affecting Maine's commercial fisheries and could have dramatic effects on lobsters, clams and other shellfish as higher carbon levels lead to more acidic oceans.
"If we do not cut carbon emissions now, particularly from power plants, it becomes much more difficult if not impossible to protect ourselves from the worst ravages of climate change," said Tom Tietenberg, a professor emeritus of economics at Colby College who has researched climate policies. "The window of opportunity is closing. The time to act is now."
Dr. Tony Owens, an emergency physician at Maine Medical Center, said he admitted three people Tuesday who attributed their breathing problems to poorer air quality. "I see the effects everyday," Owens said.
The EPA's carbon reduction plans have been noncontroversial so far in Maine, largely because the six major power plants in the state already have been operating under a carbon-reduction plan for five years. Additionally, there are no coal-fired power plants in the state.
RGGI is a nine-state program that imposes a cap on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-burning power plants and then requires those facilities to buy credits for each ton they emit.
Credits are traded on a carbon market like other commodities, generating revenue for energy conservation or home weatherization in Maine while giving regulated facilities a financial incentive to reduce emissions below their caps.
Emissions from power plants in the nine states have fallen 40 percent, although market trends toward cleaner-burning natural gas and away from coal and oil are also major factors.
Spalding said it was too early to tell whether Maine and other RGGI states would be required to go beyond their current emissions reductions under the EPA proposal. The EPA and participating states must reconcile the different methods that the two systems use to calculate emissions.
"The thought around the rule is that these kinds of market-based approaches, under RGGI or other types around the country, are good things, and we hope this rule will encourage their success in time," Spalding said after the meeting.
Marc Cone, director of the air quality program at the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, said the states and the EPA are "working our way through" what he described as one of the most complicated air regulations ever proposed. Cone said his department wants more data on how the EPA calculated its baseline emissions levels and goals to ensure that the state is given credit for its high reliance on renewable energy and successful carbon reduction to date.
Cone said the DEP is "certainly hopeful" that Maine will get credit for its progress under RGGI.
"But sometimes the details need to be fleshed out ... and some of the details are still fuzzy," Cone said.
The EPA is accepting public comment on the carbon dioxide reduction proposal through Oct. 16.

Full text:   Democratic lawmaker dies unexpectedly
YORK -- A Democrat who represented parts of southern Maine in the Legislature has died. Democratic legislative leaders said Rep. Paul McGowan of York died unexpectedly at his home on Sunday. He was 67.
McGowan served in the House of Representatives since 2012 and represented Ogunquit, as well as parts of Kittery, Wells and York. He founded the Leadership and Learning Center, a leadership development group for people in education, nonprofits and other businesses.
McGowan withdrew his re-election bid earlier this summer, citing health issues. The Portsmouth Herald reported McGowan said he was having mobility problems and was undergoing blood tests.
3 teenagers arrested in outhouse arsons
ROCKLAND -- Police said three teenagers have been charged with setting fire to multiple outhouses at a public beach in Rockland this month.
Police said the waterfront fires happened near the Scott Street Beach on July 16 and 25. They said they've charged 19-year-old Daniel Spear of South Thomaston, 18-year-old Philip Seekins of South Thomaston and a 16-year-old Thomaston boy whose name is not being released because of his age. Spear and Seekins were charged with four counts of arson while the boy faces two charges. The first fire destroyed two outhouses and the second fire destroyed their replacements. Spear and Seekins were taken to Knox County Jail following their arrest.
Man pleads guilty to wife smuggle try
JACKMAN -- A Quebec resident pleaded guilty to charges he illegally smuggled his wife into the United States earlier this month.
Court records said 40-year-old Pierre Poulin of St. Martin, Quebec, used an all-terrain vehicle to drive his wife to a wooded area near the Canada-United States border and then drove his vehicle to the Jackman entry point, intending to pick her up. Poulin's wife is a Brazilian citizen.
Border officers became suspicious of Poulin because he claimed to be traveling alone but had his wife's passport with him. Border patrol agents located Poulin's wife near the border.
Poulin's attorney, David Bate of Bangor, said despite the plea he believes the charges against his client are too harsh. Poulin faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Sea acidification group to meet for first time
AUGUSTA -- The Maine Ocean Acidification Committee will hold its first meeting on Aug. 1. The committee is studying the impacts of ocean acidification on the state's environment and its economy. It is slated to meet in Walpole.
The Maine state Legislature passed a law this spring establishing the commission to study and address the effects of ocean acidification on ecosystems and shellfisheries. State officials said the commission is the first of its kind in the eastern United States.

Full text:   The act of composting occurs when humans intervene in and enhance Nature's process of decomposing organic matter such as trees, plants, and animal waste.
Compost, formally called sterile and valuable soil amendment, is created when we mix specific kitchen food residue in a pile or a container with leaf and yard residue at home or at a commercial composting operation. All animal and plant waste will decompose or rot, and composting is a method in which we can control that breakdown to keep odors and greenhouse gases to a minimum and provide a valuable end product.
At least 30 percent of our municipal waste stream, what we humans produce from our daily activities, is organic matter. Ideally, finding a way to divert this organic part of the waste stream to better uses, such as composting, is not only a significant municipal cost-saving measure, it's a vital part of ensuring a healthier planet for the future.
Let's start with the relatively simple process of taking care of our own residential organics.
The easiest disposal for leaves and grass clippings if we have the space is to simply rake it in a pile and let nature decompose it over time.
One method to compost kitchen food scraps, such as vegetable peelings, fruit, coffee grounds, egg shells and dairy products, is to bury to scraps in a hole dug at least 12 inches deep, covering them with at least 8 inches of dirt. Within a year, these kitchen food scraps will break down into the soil.
Another simple method is to take the kitchen scraps and bury them in the middle of the pile of leaf and grass clippings, if the pile is at least a cubic yard -- 3-by-3-by-3 feet -- which is large enough to heat naturally as the material breaks down.
Small tree branches can be cut them into smaller pieces and piled in the woods to break down over time. Many cities and towns have pickup programs for branches, leaves and grass clippings. Many municipalities also have areas at the transfer station where these same materials can be dropped off, shredded or composted. Homeowners can pick up some good compost after the decomposition.
The best method to compost at home is with an enclosed four-sided bin, either with concrete blocks or wooden pallets, or by setting stakes in a circle and enclosing it with chicken wire.
These methods can be found online or by contacting the Maine Department of Environmental Protection or a local University of Maine Cooperative Extension Office.
We at Sustain Mid Maine Coalition recommend using recycled plastic compost bins, which are animal-resistant and often are easier to turn the compost.
They come as stationary bins, tumblers or "compost balls" that can be rolled to turn the material. They range in price from the Earth Machine, which is available at Kennebec Valley Council of Governments for $45 up to $500 for the most expensive compost tumblers. Many enclosed recycled plastic compost bins can be found online for $100-$200, many come with free shipping.
There are two basic types of materials: "browns" or carbon materials and "green" or nitrogen materials.
Browns include dead leaves, shredded branches, sawdust from untreated weed, wood chips, and hay or straw. Greens includes kitchen food scraps, fresh grass clippings and green plants or flowers from the garden.
"How to Compost" brochures provide ideal ratios of browns to greens in compost piles or bins. We like to keep it simple and just say about 3 to 1 browns to greens.
That is, a cubic foot of food scraps from the kitchen requires three cubic feet of leaves mixed with it.
For beginners, the best kitchen food scraps to add to the compost bin are vegetable peelings, fruit scraps, egg shells, coffee grounds and tea bags. Beginners should try to keep out meat, bones, shellfish, fish and heavy fats. Many compost brochures say keep out the dairy products, too, but I find that dairy products compost just as well if they are mixed with the browns.
For more advanced composters, fats, shellfish, meat and fish products are fine to include with a pile of between one and two cubic yards of materials, and will add good nitrogen to the compost.
Maine is well known for its fishing industry, lobsters, shellfish, blueberries, apple orchards and dairy industry, which all produce organic residuals that must be managed.
Fortunately, many commercial compost operations handle these organics.
One of the closest commercial compost operations is the Rainbow Valley Bragg Family Farm in Sidney, which composts manure, food residuals and some shellfish and sells it on a commercial scale.
Living Acres in New Sharon composts farm products and shellfish. A growing operation, Coast of Maine Organics, composts Maine wild blueberry residuals, salmon waste, ground mussels and peat into a wonderful soil amendment that is bagged and sold at local nurseries.
Knox Ridge Farm in Knox composts both farm and shellfish waste and sells the finished product commercially.
Several facilities Downeast compost ground crab waste with sawdust and lobster shells with barn dressing.
Maine is also known for its many summer fairs from Fort Kent to Kittery. Of course, these fairs include a lot of food vendors since eating is one of our favorite pastimes.
Sadly, most of these food residuals end up in the landfill or at the incinerator.
The Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce's Taste of Waterville, however, collects food scraps and paper plates. The event is on Aug. 6, and, for the fourth year, Sustain Mid-Maine Coalition volunteers will collect much of the food and paper products at disposal and recycling stations set up around the event.
Once collected, volunteers will take the separated food and paper residuals to the Bragg Farm, where we sort through it again to remove any contaminants before it is sent to the farm's composting facility.
For more information about composting or composting facilities in Maine, go online and search for "Composting in Maine" or contact Maine DEP or local Cooperative Extension Office.
Geoffrey Hill and Ross Nason are master composters, have worked on commercial composting projects and volunteer for Sustain Mid Maine Coalition's Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle Team, of which Nason is the chairman.

Full text:   SANFORD -- The three tents set up at Our Farm on Hanson Ridge Road came in handy when the clouds burst Sunday afternoon during Maine Open Farm Day.
Within seconds after the thunder started, a crowd that included seven Montreal nuns converged under their cover while farm owner Aron Gonsalves rushed to move cages of baby turkeys and chicks out of the way and bring in hay bales to sit on. Farming is all about improvisation, his wife, Laura Young, said.
"It was a great turnout," said Young.
Our Farm was one of the stops on a four-mile, 11-farm trail in the Springvale section of Sanford organized by Sanford Trails with help from Three Rivers Land Trust and Forest Works! to coincide with the 25th annual statewide event.
Some of the state's richest soil lies along Hanson Ridge, where a cluster of farms has sprung up over the decades. Local landowners opened up their land for a day to allow visitors to walk between the farms.
Lee Burnett, project director of Forest Works! -- a Springvale organization -- hatched the trail idea. He said the event involved diverse groups that do not normally work together.
"This is a way we can all help each other," he said.
Hanson Ridge is farmed by old- and new-timers. McDougal Orchards has been in the same family for 235 years.
Gonsalves and Young, Connecticut transplants via Hawaii, bought their farm a year ago.
Michele and Philip Desautels bought 37 acres of farmland and orchards on the ridge last year and dubbed it Ferment Farm. During the week they live in Waltham, Massachusetts, where she works at the U.S. Coast Guard and he works in high tech. On weekends they are back in Sanford gearing up to sell the hard cider they produce from the orchard.
"The goal is fermented food education," said Michele Desautels.
Robert Sharood started his Mousam Valley Mushrooms in 2011 while still a student at Saint Joseph's College in Standish. He harvested his first crop in 2013. A year later his pink, pearl and Italian oyster mushrooms, grown from wood chips from nearby woods, are now sold at Hannaford and Whole Foods supermarkets.
"We are ramping up to 600 pounds a week," said Sharood.
On Sunday he served visitors medicinal tea, brewed from the chaga mushrooms he collects from the birches in nearby woods.
"It's pretty good," said Alyssa Roy, who lives down the road and was visiting the farm for the first time.
Maine Open Farm Day comes just as many vegetable growers are shifting into high gear, harvesting corn, tomatoes and other high summer crops. About 90 farms across the state took part this year.
After decades of decline, Maine farms have rebounded in the past decade. Since 2007 the value of agricultural products produced by Maine farms has increased 24 percent to more than $763 million annually.
In Sanford the self-guided trail drew flocks of walkers who caught glimpses of private land that is normally off-limits. Then the rain washed down and a tractor-pulled wagon drove them back to their cars.
But Marisa Tobias of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said the rain didn't stop her from having fun.
"This is what I chose to do on my birthday," Tobias said.

Full text:   Don Gellers and his supporters believed he was being framed in a conspiracy involving the police, the courts, the Attorney General's Office and the Indian whose estranged wife he had become involved with, all with the aim of retiring the Passamaquoddy's hated and effective defender.
The evidence suggests they were correct.
A prominent Boston trial lawyer, Harvey Silverglate, soon came forward with a remarkable story: On April 18, 1968 -- just a month after Gellers' arrest -- he had had cocktails in a Bangor restaurant with Assistant Attorney General John Kelly, who bragged to him that "the powers that be in this state" were going to take down Gellers with the marijuana charge because he was a "troublemaker" who was "stirring up the Indians" and they "wanted to get him off the Indian suit." They were using Danny Bassett, an Indian whose wife was romantically involved with the young attorney, to help them get their man.
Silverglate later testified that Kelly had told him the AG's office had been working with Danny so that he "would have his revenge" and that "ultimately, if they could convict Gellers of a marijuana charge or any drug charge, they would proceed to disbar him and get him out of the case."
"(Kelly) said Danny was going to be the instrumentality in getting to Gellers," Silverglate told the court. "I took it to mean it was a setup."
Silverglate, who became a prominent and highly respected civil liberties lawyer, still recalls the scene 46 years later. "The prosecutor was talking about getting Gellers, and it was obvious to me they were looking to win the Indian suit by disabling the lawyer," says Silverglate, who came to Maine to give testimony in Gellers' hearing for a new trial. "It's not unprecedented that prosecutors would go after the lawyer who was giving them aggravation."
Silverglate himself felt vulnerable coming to Maine to testify against the authorities. "I don't think they were very happy about having me testify, and I was sure Gellers wouldn't be the last to be retaliated against for taking on an unpopular cause," says Silverglate, whose clients have included Leona Helmsley, Michael Milken and the Church of Scientology. "That's why, as soon as I testified, I got the hell out of town."
A federal prisoner in Ohio, Scott Workman, later sent Gellers' former intern, Tom Tureen, a signed affidavit, saying he had been released from the Hancock County Jail in September 1967 after agreeing with a state trooper to play the role of the Patriarca gangster in the forthcoming sting.
"Sgt. Joe McCarthy came down into the basement and called me to the side and told me that an attorney by the name of Gellers was a troublemaker who was stirring up the Indians down there, and that they were going to get him," Workman wrote. If Workman would "pose as a runaway gunman" from the Patriarca family and help state police Detective W. Lawrence Hall "in planting marijuana in Gellers' home," then the charges against him would be dismissed with the help of Assistant Attorney General Kelly.
Workman said he agreed and his charges were dropped. He claimed he later received word that "the deal is off," the implication being that the authorities had allegedly decided to have one of their own detectives play the role instead.

Kelly testifed in court that he remembered having cocktails with Silverglate in April 1968, but had no recollection of discussing the Gellers case with him. Today, Kelly says he has no memory of being involved in either the restaurant conversation or the alleged deal with Workman, but he admits the Attorney General's Office behavior should raise eyebrows. "I was a freshman attorney and more of a gofer man, so they weren't bringing me into any high-level conversations," says Kelly, who now practices law in Portland. "I do recall being taken aback at the police action and the prosecution level and their attitude toward marijuana, which when you look back from the perspective of today was laughable."
"Obviously they were very motivated (to get Gellers)," he adds. "The facts speak for themselves."
Further, in 1968, Ed Hinckley was sacked as commissioner of the state's new Indian Affairs Department for refusing to cut his expenditures. Gov. Kenneth Curtis -- an important ally of the Indians -- appointed former Passamaquoddy tribal Gov. John Stevens to replace him. Before starting work, Stevens recalls Curtis asking him if there was anything he wanted to know. "I said, 'Yes, I want to know: Did you plant that stuff on Don Gellers?'" Stevens recalls. "If they planted it, I can't trust the state police."
Thereafter, Stevens says, he was invited to the governor's office. There, Hall, the police detective who'd posed as the Mafioso, reluctantly admitted to having "put all those cigarettes all over the house and inside Don Gellers' suit pockets." Curtis, Stevens said, was apologetic. Hall was not. "They didn't want to be exposed how they operate."
Reached at his Florida home, former Gov. Curtis said he couldn't recall the meeting but didn't deny it might have occurred.
Hall also didn't recall the meeting, but said it could have happened, as he had known Curtis, who was a fellow Maine Maritime Academy alumnus. Hall said he would never have planted evidence himself, but couldn't vouch for Danny Bassett and other Indians who had unsupervised access to Gellers' home for several days during the operation.
Years later, Bangor Daily News reporter John Day wrote that in the months before the sting "there were persistent rumors in law enforcement circles about a state police investigation of Gellers." On returning from a meeting in Augusta in February 1968, Old Town Police Chief Otis N. LaBree told Day that "the boys in the Attorney General's Office were busting their tails to nail a lawyer up in Eastport on drug charges because he was 'stirring up the Indians,'" according to one of Day's published accounts, which appeared in 1980.
"I felt at the time they were really gunning for (Gellers) because he was an unpopular guy," says retired attorney Cushman Anthony, one of the only lawyers in Maine who was willing to represent Gellers on appeal. "They were trying to get rid of a grain of sand in the oyster."
[bullet] [bullet] [bullet]
Gellers believes the conspiracy extended all the way to Curtis' office, because he says he overheard Assistant Attorney General Richard Cohen placing a phone call there immediately after Gellers' conviction. This seems unlikely, however, as the governor and Attorney General James Erwin were political rivals. Indeed Erwin, a conservative "law and order" Republican, ran against Curtis in the next election.
"It was very questionable as to whether or not Gellers was guilty," former Gov. Curtis recalls, adding his own relationship with the Attorney General's Office was "basically uncooperative."
"I think Gellers was so controversial to certain segments of the population that they tried to entrap him," Curtis says.
In another strange incident a few days after the sting, Gellers' friend and co-defendant Al Cox -- free on bail -- stepped out of Gellers' house to allegedly discover Danny Bassett and his nephew Anthony "Pluto" Stanley slashing the upholstery in the attorney's car and pouring sugar into the gas tank. When Gellers tried to press charges, he says the Attorney General's Office sent Detective Hall -- who was based in York County -- to act as a "special investigator" on the complaint. Stanley admitted he and Bassett were guilty -- Gellers says -- but Hall refused to believe his signed affidavit and the court in Calais refused to issue a complaint. (Hall today says he doesn't recall the incident.)
That law enforcement was working to get rid of an unpopular attorney seemed clear. The events that followed would also put the courts in an unfavorable light.

Full text:   hundreds to Boothbay
Where can one visit a world-class botanical garden in the morning and get up close and personal with a sand shark in the afternoon? Why, the Boothbay Peninsula, of course!
One of the more recent additions to the peninsula, and a must-see location, found just off Barters Island Road in Boothbay, are the stunning 250-acre Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens.
This natural wonder has been years in the making, and work never stops as employees and volunteers toil to make sure the gardens, buildings and grounds are picture perfect. A delight for the senses, the garden combines sculpture and stone, flora and fauna for adults.
The children's gardens are welcoming and whimsical, with gorgeous playhouses right out of a storybook, a windmill, Peter Rabbit recreations, henhouse, tree house, bear cave, story time building and so much more. On Fairy Fridays, children come dressed in costumes and have special activities.
A visitor could walk the grounds all day and still find so much more to see, do and learn about, so expect to make a return visit soon. The center also offers a gift shop, cafe and other amenities, and classes and special programs are offered throughout the year.
It was voted number one in last year's TripAdvisor list of Top Ten Gardens; for more, visit the website at www.mainegardens.org.
Another vision to see when in the area is the Maine State Aquarium at McKown Point in West Boothbay Harbor, where expansive views, sea breezes and picnic tables will welcome families outside. Inside, a variety of interesting local sea creatures await, including a couple of monster-sized lobsters -- as large as 23 pounds -- along with rays, seahorses and sand sharks that are willing to be petted by human hands.
Run by the Department of Marine Services and located next to the Coast Guard Station, the aquarium is small but entertaining for children with its large touch tank. They can pick up sea stars, sea urchins, crabs and other marine life under the supervision of DMR employees. Staff are available to answer questions and offer presentations on topics such as the history of lobster fishing and other subjects.
Several computerized exhibits allow children to create their own cartoon lobster and see how lobster traps, buoys, boats and fishermen work together to capture lobster. Small art projects are available, along with a few other hands-on activities. An admission fee is charged, and some stuffed animals and other small toys and gifts are available for purchase For hours and more information, visit www.maine.gov/dmr.
Visitors to the Boothbay Region would be remiss if they didn't attend the annual Windjammer Days celebration.
This year marks the 52nd annual Windjammer Days, from June 22-28, with golf, art, boat racing, music, food, parades, family fun and, of course, windjammers.
The festivities begin June 22 with a golf tournament at the Boothbay Harbor Country Club and boat racing best viewed from the aforementioned DMR aquarium at McKown Point.
As the week gets rolling, there are arts and children's events, Coast Guard Station tours, crafts, games and storytelling, food booths, live music and shuttle services.
Among the highlights is the Cod Fish Race, in which contestants wearing slickers run a course carrying two slippery cod fish, passing them on to teammates as part of a relay. Pirates invade the dock and area tents, creating mayhem wherever they go, and the windjammer fleet will arrive off Ocean Point, reminding participants of the real reason for the celebration.
At least seven historic windjammers will remain at anchor in Linekin Bay until the windjammer parade at 1 p.m. Wednesday, June 25. The popular street parade is at 4 p.m. Fireworks are scheduled for 9:15 that night. The windjammers leave the next morning.
Other activities are clambakes, oyster shucking competitions, antique boat parade, road race and much more.
The Town of Boothbay will celebrate its 250th anniversary in August with a slate of special events for locals and visitors alike. From Aug. 22-24, activities will include a seafood festival on the Town Common, live music, a kid's tent, parade, bean hole beans supper and fireworks.
The last major festival before summer ends is Harbor Fest from Aug. 29-Sept. 7. It features a Chili Chowder Challenge and Live Music Marathon, road race, barbeque, fashion show, golf tournament, yard sale and special events, along with special offers at local merchants and restaurants. For more about any of these local festivals, visit www.boothbayharbor.com or www.boothbayharborfest.com.
Back by popular demand, the Boothbay Region Garden Club will host its third annual Home and Garden Tour on July 25.
With the theme "The Sea Around Us," the tour will take place from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and include properties that showcase the history of the region. The homes and gardens are located across the peninsula. Proceeds benefit the organization's scholarship fund, youth programs and civic development projects. For more information, visit www.boothbayregiongardenclub.org.
Another popular summer attraction is the arrival of Thomas the Tank Engine at the Boothbay Railway Village on Route 27. This year's "Day Out With Thomas" is dubbed "The Thrill of the Ride Tour 2014." The visit is scheduled for Aug. 8-10 and Aug. 15-17.
Tickets include a ride on Thomas the Tank Engine, along with other family fun events and activities. Sir Topham Hatt, a human character from the popular children's TV program, will be on hand for hand-shaking and photographs. Advance ticket purchase is recommended due to the popularity of this annual event.
The railway museum also offers exhibits of antique autos, buildings and other collections of days gone by, as well as a few friendly farm animals and other things to see and do. For tickets or more information, visit www.railwayvillage.org.
In East Boothbay, the Shipyard Cup Regatta is sure to attract crowds Aug. 7-10, when yachts race for the 12th year in a row. This year, Hodgdon Shipbuilding's popular regatta includes cocktail parties, sailing, camaraderie and, of course, lots of Maine lobster. For more, visit www.shipyardcup.com.
For a complete calendar of events from the Boothbay Region, visit the Chamber of Commerce Website at www.boothbayharbor.com.

Full text:   Every day, we hear more evidence that changes in the global climate are real and threatening: New examples of extreme weather, the alarming rate of species extinction, and the melting of the West Arctic Ice Sheet that could result in a sea level rise of 12 feet by 2100.
Some changes feel more immediate and close to home: Ocean acidification that threatens our shellfish industry (studies by the University of Maine suggest that the juvenile lobster population has fallen by more than half since 2007), an increase in ticks that suck the life blood from the state's moose and temperature spikes that increase the risk of asthma and stroke.
One has to be willfully blind to deny the evidence shown us by thousands of scientist across the globe, but we do not have to passively shrug our shoulders and let the worst happen.
There are two main culprits in the United States that emit the greenhouse gases driving these changes in our oceans and atmosphere: automobiles and power plants.
Fortunately, the Obama administration is more enlightened about environmental issues than is ours here in Maine. Obama already has issued orders to reduce auto emissions and has announced a major initiative to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants.
The rules are flexible regarding how the reduction can be achieved, such as reducing consumer demand, investing in carbon-free generation, and developing carbon capture and storage techniques. Even one of the worst polluters in the country admits that it can install equipment that will enable it to comply with environmental regulations without passing the cost on to consumers (newspaper, "Polluter survives coal war," May 29).
I urge others to join with me in urging Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King to support these carbon dioxide emission standards for existing power plants.

Full text:   MS obit with photo for Robert E. Parlin to run 6/6/14
1925-2014
Robert E. "Lefty" Parlin, 89, passed away peacefullly at his Farmington home, surrounded by his loved ones, on Thursday, June 5. Bob was born May 17, 1925, the son of Millard and Alverna Wells Parlin, of New Vineyard.
After graduating from Farmington High School, Bob was drafted into the Navy in September 1943, serving aboard a landing craft as a gunners' mate first class in the Pacific Theater. Discharged in March 1946, Lefty returned to his hometown, where he was employed by the Maine Department of Transportation, eventually becoming a highway supervisor before retiring in 1987.
On Oct. 4, 1946, he married the love of his life, Alice Hagerstrom. They lived in Fairbanks for 67 years, where they raised their three children, Janis, Vicki and Gary. Later in life, he became affectionately known as "Buppa" to his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
One of Bob's greatest passions was baseball. On Aug. 17, 2008, he was elected to the Maine Baseball Hall of Fame to celebrate his legacy as a hard-hitting first baseman and legendary Little League coach. He started all four years at Farmington High School, and after returning from the Navy, he became a small town legend, playing for both the New Vineyard and Temple town teams. In 1960, after retiring from playing, he formed the Fairbanks Little League team, which he coached for the next 23 years, amassing a record of 270 wins and 62 losses. His teams won 18 league championships during his reign. One of his great memories was how his Red Sox brought together the entire village of Fairbanks. The oyster stew suppers, trips to Fenway Park, and of course the many games and practices inspired so many. Bob Parlin was a legend in Fairbanks. One of the local townsfolk was quoted as saying, "No one will ever know how many kids' lives he has touched. He is truly loved in Fairbanks for making a difference."
Bob was predeceased by his wife, Alice; his brothers, Millard "Sonny" Parlin and Roger Parlin; and grandson Shawn Haggan. He is survived by his three children, Janis Haggan, and her husband, Barry, of Lewiston, Vicki Hardy and her husband, Tim, of Farmington, and Gary Parlin and his wife, Sharon, of Farmington; grandchildren Barry "Rocky" Haggan, of Lewiston, Tammy Cowans and her husband, Rob, of Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, Tim "TD" Hardy and his wife, Bett, of Farmington, Kaitlyn Bruder and her husband, Charlie, of Falmouth, and Cole Parlin and his wife, Hillary, of Kittery; and great-grandchildren Kyle and Shania Haggan, Colby and Chase Bruder, Dylan and Keira Cowan, and Jackson and Benjamin Hardy. Bob is also survived by his cat and companion Lefty.
The family would like to thank Beacon Hospice and all the loving caregivers who made it possible for Bob to spend his final days at home.
Visitation will be from 2 to 3 p.m. Sunday, June 8, at Adams-McFarlane Funeral & Cremation Services, 108 Court St., Farmington. A funeral service will be held immediately following at 3 p.m., with Stan Wheeler officiating. A private interment will take place at Fairview Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Fairbanks Red Sox, c/o Mike Bolduc, 124 New Vineyard Road, Farmington, ME 04938.
Condolences may be sent for the family at www.adamsmcfarlane.com.

Full text:   A trial in federal court in Bangor beginning Tuesday will decide whether a chemical company responsible for dumping mercury from a now-closed plant in Orrington will be required to clean up the contamination that still remains decades later along the banks of the Penobscot River and the mouth of the Penobscot Bay.
The trial, expected to last four weeks in U.S. District Court, comes just a month after state officials issued an order banning lobster and crab harvesting for at least the next two years and two months after the state's high court ruled that the company, Mallinckrodt US, had to carry out an estimated $130 million cleanup on the site of the former HoltraChem Manufacturing Co.
While the state case focused on the contaminated land where the plant once stood, the federal lawsuit that was first brought against Mallinckrodt in 2000 by the citizens group Maine People's Alliance and the environmental action group Natural Resources Defense Council focuses on cleaning up the contamination.
Though the HoltraChem plant has been closed since 2000, a scientific study ordered by the federal court found last year that enough mercury contamination remains in the soil along the banks of the river and in fish and plants north of Fort Point in the bay that the state ordered the two-year ban on lobster and crab harvesting.
The contamination spread far enough into the estuaries along the river that scientists working for the federal court sought special permission to notify state officials in 2011 about dangerously high mercury levels found in black ducks, according to court records. The state responded by issuing a consumer warning and posting signs in Mendall Marsh telling women and children to avoid eating waterfowl from the area altogether and for all others to limit how much they eat.
The Natural Resources Defense Council said in a pre-trial brief submitted in federal court last week that scientific studies show that although the plant dumped the vast majority of the mercury when it first opened in 1967 and into the 1970s, it could still take another 60 or more years for the contamination to dissipate without intervention.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said in a pre-trial brief submitted in federal court last week that scientific studies show that although the plant dumped the vast majority of the mercury when it first opened in 1967 and into the 1970s, it could still take another 60 or more years for the contamination to dissipate without intervention.
"Prior to the closure, unsuspecting commercial fishermen caught lobsters and crabs from the Upper Estuary and sold them to unwitting consumers every day of the fishing season. Some, like Kenneth Wyman, a 26-year veteran of Maine's lobster trade, fed their families -- including pregnant women and young children -- regular meals of tainted shellfish," the NRDC's lead attorney, Mitchell Bernard, argued in the 28-page pre-trial brief.
The NRDC is asking the judge to rule that the level of contamination is too harmful to remain untreated and order Mallinckrodt to pay for ongoing mercury studies, testing and future remediation that could include dredging, capping or introducing oxygen or nutrients to prevent harmful effects of mercury.
Tuesday's trial is the second in the federal case. A different judge, who is now retired, found in the first trial in 2002 that Mallinckrodt is liable for the mercury contamination and ordered a study panel of scientists to be formed to oversee an investigation from 2005 to 2013. Mallinckrodt was also ordered to pay for that investigation.
Mallinckrodt, a St. Louis-based pharmaceutical company that inherited responsibility for HoltraChem after HoltraChem went bankrupt and dissolved in 2001, contends that it will show at trial that the Penobscot River system is less contaminated and is recovering faster than the team of scientists suggest in their final 2013 report.
The company also argued in its pre-trial court filing that some remediation options could cause "more harm than good."
"Mercury in the river is not posing an unacceptable risk to human health, nor is it causing significantly adverse effects on populations of organisms. In the absence of any actual harm, elaborate further studies and pilot tests on speculative remedies are unnecessary," Mallinckrodt's attorney, Jeffrey Talbert, wrote in his 27-page pre-trial brief.
Mallinckrodt is a subsidiary of global healthcare products company Covidien, which also said it believes smaller-scale remediation efforts may be more appropriate.
"It is premature to speculate on the outcome of the trial," Covidien's spokeswoman, Lisa Clemence, said in an email Friday. "The court will hear the evidence and make a ruling based on that evidence and the law governing this matter. Mallinckrodt does not believe large scale remediation is necessary; however, the company has developed a proposal for certain limited studies and a proposal for monitoring some wildlife species, including but not limited to, certain fish and birds."
The Maine People's Alliance, which has allowed the NRDC to take the lead role in litigating the case against Mallinckrodt, said on Friday that it plans to hold a rally on the steps of the federal courthouse in Bangor at 8 a.m. before the trial starts on Tuesday.
The MPA's executive director, Jesse Graham, said it "wants Mallinckrodt to make it right."
"We want the mercury contamination removed, we want our river restored and we want to once again feel safe fishing for and eating the lobster and other seafood in that region," Graham said. "And that means we need the corporation that has been found responsible for the pollution to be held accountable for cleaning it up. This shouldn't be the taxpayers' burden."
Bernard, the NRDC's lead attorney, declined to comment on the case beyond what he said in his pre-trial legal filings. But Nancy Marks, another member of the litigation team, issued a statement on the group's behalf.
"This case is about two things. On the most immediate level, it's about securing an effective and environmentally sound cleanup for this iconic River, which is saturated with toxic mercury. The cleanup is for the people who look to the River for healthy food, for their livelihood, for recreation, and for spiritual sustenance. The cleanup is also for the imperiled birds, fish, and wildlife that populate the River's shores and waters," Marks said in the written statement. "On another level, this case is about corporate responsibility. Mallinckrodt made a profit while poisoning the Penobscot with mercury, endangering public health and the environment. For over forty years, the burdens of that contamination have been borne by Maine communities. Both federal law and principles of fairness demand that Mallinckrodt shoulder the burden now for cleaning up its pollution."
Between 25 and 30 witnesses are expected to be called during the trial, and much of the evidence will likely focus on the eight-year investigation overseen by the panel of scientists.

Full text:   MY DAD WOULD absolutely kill me if he knew about this.
Unless you're my father, you're probably not reading this on the edge of your seat wondering what I'm about to confess -- in a newspaper, no less -- to doing last weekend.
It was Saturday night of Memorial Day weekend, and I was perched at a high-top table on the balcony of a bar/restaurant in Bar Harbor.
My buddy Todd and I had just been brought our food, which was intended less for nutritional value and more to provide something of a sturdy foundation onto which we could pour one or two (or five) more beers.
Todd, an Arizona native I've known for a few years, looked at me over the top of his plate quizzically.
"What would he kill you for?"
I gestured to my own meal.
"This. I've got Maine lobster on top of a burger, barely visible under a pile of American cheese. And I'm about to put ketchup on it. Dad would be disgusted."
Now don't get me wrong. It's not that my old man doesn't like a burger, or a beer. But he'd be drafting the papers to disown me if he knew I was treating lobster with such reckless abandon.
When I was growing up in Australia, in a middle-class family, seafood was definitely a rare luxury. December falls in the first month of our summer, so at the Crawford family Christmas lunch there was more likely to be a great big bowl of cold cooked prawns on ice, and an equally sized bowl for the shells and heads.
It took me until I was probably in my early teens to acquire the taste for seafood, but once I was there, I was hooked (no pun intended.) But despite that, prawns, oysters, scallops and bug -- what we call flathead lobster -- were reserved for special occasions.
Even on vacations over the last few years, my intake of the red crustacean has been restricted to the first weekend in September, when I help two buddies run a seafood festival down in Providence, R.I., where I get paid for three days of backbreaking labor with all the Narragansett I can drink, and lobster rolls.
But here I am now, living in a corner of the world whose number one export by value in 2013 was lobster (there's so much of it, y'all are sending it away!), and suddenly what was an extremely rare and expensive treat is something I can go out and get for lunch every day, if I felt the urge.
Not only that, I'm slapping a couple of slices of cheese on the stuff and eating it on a burger. I could literally have had it on anything I wanted that night: It said right there on the menu that you could add lobster to any dish for $9. Sounds like a challenge to me.
The variety of food from region to region in the United States has always been one of the things I've loved about this country, and certainly one of my thinly veiled excuses for coming back so many times on vacation, and wanting to travel to so many places.
I'm a bottomless pit when it comes to Mexican food, so California and even places in southern Colorado hold a place in my heart -- and stomach. The South and the Midwest each accommodate my beer-drinker's palate for deep-fried goodness, I can see the beauty in both New York- and Chicago-style pizza, and I've had barbecue in more different places than I can count.
Since food is such a universal thing, but also differs so greatly, one thing people inevitably ask me about when they're getting to know me is, "What's the food like Down Under? Is it different? Was it hard to get used to American food?" Amusingly, in 2008, the mother of a girl I ended up dating for a couple of years asked me whether we "have pizza in Australia." Her daughter, who had studied abroad in my country the year before, was absolutely mortified.
In case you were wondering, yes we do have pizza back home, and the cuisine isn't altogether that different. We have more Asian and English influences, through geographical location and heritage, respectively, but all in all it's reasonably similar. In my humble opinion, anyway.
I recently joined a Facebook group called "Australians in America," more out of sheer morbid curiosity than to connect with fellow expatriates. And while there are some interesting topics of conversation (and a considerable amount of complaining about how the U.S. isn't like Australia -- go figure), a lot of it seems to be about "foods you miss from home," and it's like an echo chamber. Beer brands, Cherry Ripe and Picnic ("Deliciously Ugly") candy bars, meat pies and sausage rolls.
Every few weeks I'll get a text from my mother or sister, asking whether there's anything I want in a care package from home. The latter relative sent me a huge box right around Christmas that was brimming with Tim Tams -- Australia's most desired hybrid cookie/candy bar ... thing -- as well as chips and other odds and ends. But when I've received subsequent deliveries of Tim Tams, I squirrel away a couple for myself and take the rest to the office for my coworkers, under the premise that they're low in calories because of the metric system, or something. I'd wager, though, that if I brought in a jar of Vegemite, it would be consumed with a lot less fervor.
I don't know whether it's because I haven't been away from Australia for long -- I celebrated six months as an American permanent resident last Sunday, as a matter of fact -- but there's just not all that many consumables I miss that can't be replicated here.
There's a great Maine soda company that makes a non-alcoholic ginger beer very similar to an excellent one made in my home state of Queensland, and if I can get chips flavored like chicken and waffles, do I really yearn for a variety I can only get back home?
I know there'll come a time -- probably in the height of summer -- when I'll crave a cold beer and a sausage roll one Sunday afternoon. But until then, I'm perfectly content to make do with lobstah.

Full text:   Consumers aim to support local economy, know history of food from farm stand to fish market
CAPE ELIZABETH -- Mainers have a hearty appetite for local food, but a new survey has found many barriers still prevent them from tossing Maine-grown items into their shopping baskets.
In a survey of food-buying habits, nearly 80 percent of Maine consumers said they prefer purchasing their produce, meat and fish locally, primarily because they want to support their farmers, fishermen and community businesses.
Despite a strong affinity for eating local, the survey found the local food movement still has plenty of room to grow -- and there are things producers can do to make it easier for shoppers to choose Maine foods, particularly when it comes to buying fish.
Marketing strategies such as labeling foods clearly as Maine-grown or -raised, telling the stories behind the products, and providing information on preparation and cooking would make local food more accessible to the public, according to Maine Food Strategy steering committee members who released the survey Monday in front of the Jordan's Farm produce stand.
"The primary reason people buy local foods is to help the local economy," said Mark Dvorozniak of Marketing Strategy Decisions, who is a member of the committee. "But it's the direct communication with farmers and fishermen that's really important."
Maine Food Strategy is a nonprofit organization that is trying to strengthen the food network in Maine. Their statewide telephone survey of nearly 600 households, conducted by the University of Southern Maine Muskie School of Public Service, found that 58 percent of Mainers spend more than $50 on local food in a typical month. Overall, Mainers cited freshness, flavor and nutrition as top concerns when considering what goes on their shopping lists. Those were followed by cost and whether the animals providing meat for their tables were raised humanely. Consumers also showed a preference for food that is antibiotic and hormone-free.
Mainers overwhelmingly reported doing most of their shopping at chain grocery stores, but more than 56 percent said they also buy food at a farmers market or farm stand.
In a first for Maine, the survey asked people about their gardening, hunting, fishing and foraging habits.
"We found that a little more than a third of households produce some of their own food," said Tanya Swain, co-director of Maine Food Strategy, "and of the ones that are doing this, about 70 percent plan to do the same or more this year."
While two-thirds of the consumers surveyed said they had bought fish, seafood or shellfish in the last month, only 47 percent bought fish from Maine waters, said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association and a member of the Maine Food Strategy steering committee.
"Fishermen historically have been left out of this conversation, and it's time we start talking about seafood and putting it back on the table for our local consumers," he said. "While many consumers don't think about seafood when they're looking to buy local, the state of Maine has a fantastic fleet of boats that sustainably target a wide variety of fish and shellfish that are landed up and down the coast."
One of the reasons people gave for not buying more Maine fish is because it's not clear where the fish in the seafood case comes from, suggesting that labeling would be a good idea, Martens said.
"We need to do a better job of highlighting and labeling our products," he said. "We've not done a good enough job in answering the questions as to what to buy, where to get it and even how to cook it."
Overall, Dvorozniak said, the report "confirms the demand for local foods and provides insight for businesses to grow."
He said producers and retailers need to broaden the variety and availability of local food, offer quality at a reasonable price and educate consumers with recipes and serving suggestions. Businesses should emphasize the specific geographic source of foods and the environmental conditions in which they were raised, to reinforce the freshness factor.
"People in Maine and all across the globe want to know the source, and more importantly, the story behind their food," Dvorozniak said. "And boy, do we have stories here in Maine -- authentic stories, both old and new."
Hanne Tierney, who raises vegetables and pastured pork at Cornerstone Farm in Palmyra, said she often shares such stories with her customers.
"All through the farmers market, people come up to me and say, 'Tell me about your sausage,'" she said. "They aren't asking what types of sausage I have. They want to hear that the pig was bred, born and raised right on my farm and that I didn't use any antibiotics or growth hormones or animal byproducts or any of those things."
While she welcomes such interaction, she thinks they may be the equivalent of preaching to the choir.
"I'm not sure we're reaching the part of the population that isn't as concerned where their food comes from," she said.
John Bott, spokesman for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, said the results of the survey are "consistent with what we've found" when it comes to the need for building stronger connections between consumers and producers.
Working toward that goal, the state's getrealmaine.com website developed the first searchable database of farmers markets online.
Most recently, the department came up with a way for consumers to connect with farmers right in the grocery store. The project, now being developed further by the Maine Farm Bureau, allows consumers to scan the product code on a bunch of carrots and then see a brief description of the place the carrots were grown and hear their story straight from the farmer in a minutelong video.
"We're clearly optimistic that there's even more that can be done in Maine to link consumers with local Maine food and products," he said.
The Maine Food Strategy group will be sharing key findings of the survey in briefings held around the state throughout the summer.
The meetings will be held June 26 at the St. Mary's Nutrition Center in Lewiston and the Good Food Council of Lewiston-Auburn; July 8 on at Coastal Enterprises, Inc. in Portland; and July 16 at Aroostook Partnership for Progress in Caribou.
Registration details will be posted at mainefoodstrategy.org.

Full text:   Maine farmers are diversifying their crops to meet the demands of customers who are passionate about eating locally and increasingly savvy in the kitchen. That's what the 2012 census data released Friday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture seem to show, according to state agriculture leaders.
Maine farmers are growing more trendy foods, sometimes responding to the menu requirement at farm-to-table restaurants and sometimes driving them. When the last census was completed, in 2007, kale was grown over a total of just 2 acres in Maine, on 10 farms, though the greens are well-suited to the Maine climate. Five years and a green smoothie craze later, 53 farms grew kale over 16 acres.
The number of pigs and hogs being raised in Maine more than doubled to 8,923, despite high grain prices.
"You get bragging rights in Portland if you can source your foods locally," said agriculture Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. "So the value of those animals has gone up. There's an incentive now, and we certainly look to that to continue to grow."
Maine has bucked the broader trend in farming. The number of farms in the United States declined by 4 percent between 2007 and 2012. In Maine, the number increase slightly to 8,174. The market value of Maine's agricultural products increased 24 percent to more than $763 million in 2013.
The local-food movement has helped, Whitcomb said.
"I think it is kind of a push-pull with the exponential growth in farmers markets and the growth in the number of farms that participate in" community-supported agriculture programs, in which customers typically buy a share of the harvest directly from the farm.
In 2007, Maine had about 63 farmers markets. By 2012, that number was up to approximately 100. Today there are about 135 markets, although that number includes winter markets that might be considered duplicative.
For farmers like Stacy Brenner who has been farming for 13 years, eight of them at Broadturn Farm in Scarborough, diversification has always been key. She and her husband grow flowers and about 120 varieties of vegetables. "Anything we can get to grow in Maine," she said. "And people seem to be more open to leafy greens, more open generally to a variety of vegetables."
Her typical customer has a Vitamix blender at home and is looking for kale and spinach for the health-conscious smoothie. Broadturn has a farmstand in Scarborough, another at Aurora Provisions in Portland and runs a farm share program. She pushes her customers to try new things, but she also learns from their restaurant experiences.
"Brussel sprouts are all the rage now," she said.
Broadturn Farm also grows potatoes, another crop that has seen an interesting transition since the 2007 census, when there were 464 farms growing potatoes in Maine. In 2012, there were 741, but the total acreage didn't go up all that much. That's because competition with Western growers has cut into the Maine potato's marketability, Whitcomb said. As a result, some potato fields have been turned over to hayland, primarily for feeding horses. But more growers are adding parcels of potatoes here and there for sale on the fresh market. And not just at farmers market stands.
"A lot of these mid-sized Maine growers are supplying the Hannafords and the Market Baskets and the Walmarts," Whitcomb said.
The census data marks other significant shifts on Maine farms. Farmers added irrigation systems on nearly 10,000 acres of farmland, an increase of 47 percent. In 2012, 386 farmers were growing greenhouses, up from 125 in 2007.
Whitcomb said he'll be mining the Farm Census for months to come as he makes his way from one speaking engagement to another. The positive trends he sees in the report include a big boost in aquaculture, with the value of sales increasing by 185 percent, up to $75 million, much of it in farmed oysters and mussels.
There are more maple producers in Maine now than in 2007, up 10 percent to 517, and 27 percent more trees are being tapped.
"It's kind of a fun thing to do of course, but there is also a growing level of sophistication to these operations," Whitcomb said. "It's not just putting out four buckets on the trees in the yard. It's 80,000 taps in one of the operations near the Canadian border."
Another area of growth, with still-untapped potential, Whitcomb said, is agri-tourism. That's a wide ranging category of farm activities, including apple picking, cheese tastings, hay rides and corn mazes. Income to Maine farms from agri-tourism was up 78 percent in the five year period, with $1.8 million in agri-tourism sales in 2012.
"We see positive trends around the state and it's nice when the numbers help us verify that it is true," Whitcomb said.

Full text:   The Sustain Mid Maine Coalition held its fifth annual meeting on Jan. 25, celebrating five years of work by volunteers trying to reduce consumption of fossil fuels and prevent the worst effects of global climate change because too much carbon dioxide is being put into the air.
We already have exceeded 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the air, which was the target that many scientists told us to try to avoid.
Many have been aware of global climate change for many years. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol, sponsored by the United Nations, recommended that all nations greatly reduce generation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In 2005, many of us viewed or read "An Inconvenient Truth," Al Gore's movie and book.
The ice caps and glaciers are melting, which will increase the level of the ocean several feet, flood the world's coastlines and make many structures unusable.
The ocean is also turning more acidic. As this continues, many kinds of fish, shellfish and underwater vegetation will no longer be able to survive.
Weather is changing, as evidenced by such vicious storms as Hurricane Katrina and superstorm Sandy that hit New York City and New Jersey last year. Rainstorms put more stormwater into our road drainage systems, causing severe damage to our public road systems, as happened recently in Vermont.
Much less rain is falling in the southwestern United States, where limits are set about how much water can be used in urban areas and to irrigate agricultural fields.
These changes are being observed in many parts of the world, although parts of the world farther from the equator should continue to have enough rain.
To open the Sustain Mid Maine annual meeting, I recited the following invocation.
"Let us pray for fairness.
"Let us remember that the most basic human instinct is for survival, as it is for other forms of life. For survival, we need to be able to breathe clean air, drink clean water, eat healthy food and live in a climate that is not too cold or too hot. All creatures need this. We need this not only for today, next week, next month and next year, but for ever and a day. Our children and our grandchildren need this.
"The world will be more fair if all people everywhere and forever are able to have this. Help us contribute to making the world a fair and healthy place for all people.
"Help us plan ahead for a strong economy in which all people have an opportunity to have clean air, drink clean water, eat healthy food and live in a climate that is not too cold or too hot.
"Help us plan together, and implement plans together, to avert the most terrible effects of global climate change before it is too late. It is already too late to prevent some of the effects of climate change from happening. Help us plan and adjust to the changes in our way of life that will be needed to survive.
"Help us find ways to obtain the energy we need without consumption of the fossil fuels that are causing global climate change. Help us to understand that the true cost of fossil fuel, when including the cost of the damage that fossil fuel does to our actual economy, including the environment, is really more expensive than alternative sources of energy.
"Please, help us to define and implement the best, most fair, ways to achieve a sustainable future for all people around the world."
We all need to work together, aggressively, in order to survive.
On April 22, we will observe Earth Day 2014, a day when we all should take time to consider and celebrate the good things about the environment in which we live.
We do have cleaner water and air than we had at the time of the first Earth Day in 1970. At that time, most people supported the need for laws to provide us with a more healthy environment. This year, let us all think about the things that still are needed to ensure that we and our children will have a healthy place to live here on Earth.

Full text:   "It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change."
-- Charles Darwin
This has to be an enormously frustrating time for scientists, particularly for those who work in climate, vaccinations and evolution. Despite hundreds of millions of hours of research and testing, large segments of the public continue to ignore their voices, encouraged by those who seem to gleefully embrace the virtues of ignorance over "elitist" science.
Scientists have been warning us about climate change since the 1970s, with articles, seminars and research papers signed by hundreds of top scientists. They have been as clear as scientific integrity allows: Without significant changes in our reliance on dirty fuels, we and our children will face incomprehensible consequences to our environment, weather, food, health and security.
Last week, 772 of the world's most accomplished climate scientists issued an SOS to the world, through the United Nations, warning about the spread of disease, extreme weather, sea level rise, property losses, threats to the food chain and increasing political instability.
The response to decades of these warnings has been multi-faceted. Industry-funded "movements" have sprung up to undermine science. Vest-pocket scientists have been hired to turn every small unknown into an indictment. Conservative activists and politicians, eager to embrace any argument against government, have been actively enlisted and duly rewarded. Meaningful action has ground to a halt.
But climate change doesn't care much about politics, and it is accelerating now at a rate that is faster than scientists projected a decade ago.
Today, public attitudes about climate change are shifting as more people see unusual events, around the world and here. USA Today and Stanford polling in December showed that 71 percent say that can see the effects of global warming.
Gallup this week reported that 57 percent of Americans now believe that climate change is caused by human behavior.
Meanwhile, an analysis of climate polling shows majority support in every state -- red or blue -- for offering incentives for solar, wind and water power and limiting greenhouse gases from businesses and power plants.
What is happening with public attitudes about climate change follows a familiar arc that other transformative debates have taken. First comes a long period of discussion, learning, reflection and resistance. Support grows slowly and then accelerates to a tipping point.
Examples abound, ranging from the end of apartheid in South Africa to the fall of the Soviet Union and in the sudden overthrow of dictatorships across the globe. We've seen that same progression in America with shifts in public attitudes about race, women, gays and the environment.
Each of those changes simmered quietly over a long period, then heated up and finally and suddenly boiled over. In the end, the rapidity of change after a tipping point was reached has invariably surprised people.
Who in the 20th century, for instance, anticipated a black president? Who imagined that the leading candidate for president today would be a woman? Who foresaw the sudden acceptance of gay marriage? All seemed impossible until they weren't.
When I was growing up along the banks of the Kennebec River in Waterville, some things were thought to be forever unchanging. Among them were a stinking, Technicolor river, ashtrays in every home, high rates of cancer in almost every family and roadsides littered with trash.
We had a big conversation about all of those things, not unlike the one we're having now about climate. People offered dire warnings, both for and against change. Groups formed to protect industry or the rest of us. Then change happened.
Today, people fish and swim in the river, returnable bottles are in our garages rather than on the roadsides and ashtrays are more common in antique stores than living rooms.
The tipping point on climate is approaching, not because scientists are becoming better communicators, but because people are seeing climate change both in their backyards and the daily news.
Growing seasons are changing. New birds and animals are at the feeders or in the garden. Cod and lobsters are migrating offshore and northward to cooler waters.
Increasing acidity and warming water are weakening shellfish and expanding the range of invasive species such as green crabs.
The climate change conversation is broadening from the educated elites to the people who work with their hands every day. And that, more than anything else, tells us that a tipping point is fast approaching.

Full text:   kj.sustainability.0302: Covering some of the Maine Water and Sustainability Conference, Mitchell Center-sponsored conference at the civic center today, focusing on water (fresh and salt) quality and sustainability issues/info. sessions.
AUGUSTA -- Sable, an 8-year-old shepherd mix adopted from an animal shelter, has a nose for sniffing out trouble.
Sable's nose that knows has taken the dog and its handler, Scott Reynolds, co-owner of Environmental Canine Services, across the country, sniffing out human sewage in water where it doesn't belong. The dog is more efficient and effective than traditional, human-dependent methods, helping communities clean up their lakes, rivers and beaches.
On Tuesday, the pair were at the Maine Water and Sustainability Conference at the Augusta Civic Center. Reynolds explained the dog's sniffing skills and how they are used. Several hundred people who work with or are interested in water resources and environmental sustainability attended the conference.
"He's a human-sewage-detecting dog," said Reynolds, of Michigan, who is starting a branch of his business in the Portsmouth, N.H., area to serve the Northeast. "He's a lot faster than traditional methods."
When he's not working, Sable enjoys snuggling on the couch, howling with coyotes, sleeping and barking at cats, but he's always ready and excited to work. Reynolds said Sable loves sniffing out human waste so much he is disappointed when, as was the case Tuesday, his green work vest is placed on him but they go to a speaking engagement, not a sniffing assignment. Reynolds believes Environmental Canine Services is the only such service in the country.
Sable and his co-worker, Logan, a collie mix, track down human waste, which is helpful when human sources of bacteria are hurting water quality, but it's not known where the human waste is coming from. They search out human waste specifically and signal when they find it. Sable barks; Logan sits.
They help sniff out leaks from sewer systems into stormwater systems and from septic systems into water bodies.
Reynolds said more traditional methods of finding bacteria sources rely on sending potentially contaminated soils to a laboratory, which takes at least 24 hours to test the samples and even then can't always tell whether the waste that was the source of the bacteria was human or animal.
Reynolds said Sable has been working as a sniffer for five or six years. He said training him took about a year using methods similar to those used to train bomb- or drug-sniffing dogs.
In Maine, the dogs and Reynolds have worked in Portland and Kittery working with FB Environmental, which has offices in Portland and Portsmouth.
Reynolds and Sable were among the more popular vendors at Tuesday's conference, which organizers said has grown to become one of the largest environment-related conferences in Maine.
This year the conference, founded in 1994 by the Senator George J. Mitchell Center at the University of Maine as the Maine Water Conference, added "Sustainability" to its name and focus, reflecting its broader mission.
"Water problems are never just water problems," Mitchell Center Director David Hart said in explaining why sustainability was added to the conference title and focus. "If we hope to solve these problems, you have to look at water and many other things."
Conference session topics included the effect of water withdrawals on water supply and quality, lake management strategies, Maine's energy future, climate-related trends, safe beaches and shellfish beds, and management approaches for sustainable urban streams.
Robert Kates, a senior research associate at Harvard University and professor of sustainability science at the University of Maine, described how the science of sustainability can lead to action that is good for both the environment and society. Kates, a winner of the National Medal of Science, said knowledge can result in action when those involved take four steps: identify a problem, create knowledge about the problem, find a solution and take action.
Kates, who is studying climate change and the vulnerability of culverts not designed to handle the amount of water flow from major storms testing them now, said a recent survey of town managers indicated culverts were at the top of the list of things they thought their towns would need help adapting to climate change.
He said large storms that historically occurred once every 100 years, the yardstick used between 1950 and 1979, now occur more often, at an interval of once every 60 years.
Kates said tools including rain mapping and other scientific data can be used to plan what size culverts could be needed in a spot for the next 50 years.
Mark Borsuk, associate professor in the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, spoke on "Gambling with the Globe: The Role of Risk in Decision-Making for Sustainability."
Borsuk said scientists should include the risks associated with climate change as they report on the issue, so people, most of whom are naturally risk-averse, understand what's at stake if they decide to do nothing about a problem.
He said most people recognize the risks of climate change, yet policymakers are reluctant to take action to address climate change because of its complexity and uncertainty.
He said protecting against severe consequences is a basic principle of sustainability, and if there is a risk of such consequences, if people are aware of those risks, they will be more likely to take action or precautionary measures -- even in the face of uncertainty about those consequences. Borsuk noted there will always be some level of uncertainty in models trying to predict the future of the climate.
Borsuk used a Yogi Berra quote to help explain: "It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."

Full text:   Invasive species increasingly devours native shellfish, interferes with lobster fishing
Gov. Paul LePage on Friday ordered the creation of a task force to study and combat the invasive European green crab, which fishermen along the coast have said is decimating shellfish populations.
Although the species has been reported in Maine since 1904, recent weather patterns and warming ocean temperatures appear to have allowed the tiny creatures to multiply and move north, devouring blue mussels, soft- and hard-shell clams and coastal grasses.
The crabs have contributed to wetland erosion as well as depleted populations of spat, the tiny juvenile clams that are easy targets for the voracious species.
"Green crabs are threatening our state's $25 million bivalve shellfish industry, which is Maine's third most lucrative fishery," LePage said. "It's critical that we protect the fishery and the good jobs the industry supports."
The 12-member panel will include representatives from the state departments of Marine Resources, Environmental Protection, and Economic and Community Development, as well as towns with shellfish ordinances, representatives of the bivalve fishery and marine resource industry, and three researchers.
The task force will be charged with identifying the direct economic impact of the crabs on the shellfish industry, develop long-term eradication and control plans, and identify the cost of the crab-control strategies. A report is due by Sept. 30.
Brian Beal, a marine ecologist at the University of Maine who specializes in shellfish, struck a balance between optimism for the governor's recognition of the problem and the challenge that lies ahead for the task force members.
"It's going to be a lot of work to complete," said Beal, who was present during the governor's announcement at the annual Maine Fishermen's Forum in Rockport.
Beal said the regulatory environment is ripe for changes, and that a group of focused, creative professionals could come up with a creative solution that until now has been prevented by state-imposed limits on green crab fishing.
"How do you get rid of an invasive species? You fish 'em to death," Beal said. "We did an awful good job of reducing population of sea urchins without even trying."
Beal said reducing or eliminating catch and size limits imposed in 2000 would be a logical first step to reducing the green crab population.
Creating a viable economic market for the crabs would be next, he said, either as fodder for compost and fertilizer, chicken feed or pet food; or as a source for a medically valuable substance contained in the crabs' shells.
"I think if there's a price that fishermen will get for their effort that's economically doable, then I think the sky's the limit," he said.
Even so, the challenge ahead is daunting, said Sara Randall, a spokeswoman for the Maine Clammers Association.
Randall said about 90 percent of the clam flats in Casco Bay are devoid of legally harvestable shellfish. Only the areas nearest the shoreline have remained impenetrable to the crabs, which come toward shore from deeper waters.
Also unknown, Randall said, is the effect of the crabs on the state's lobster fishery. Lobstermen are reporting more green crabs in their traps, forcing the fishermen to plumb deeper water farther from the coast to find lobsters.
In laboratory settings, green crabs outcompete lobsters, especially when lobsters are still young, she said.
"The devastation is so profound at this point," Randall said.
Both Beal and LePage reiterated that on top of concerns about the environment and the economic threat to clammers' jobs, the state's tourism industry also could take a hit, posing a gustatory dilemma in a state known for its seafood.
"How do you have a clambake without any clams?" Beal said.

Mercury scare shows environmental rules' value

Publication info: Morning Sentinel ; Waterville, Me. [Waterville, Me]25 Feb 2014: 1.A.

Abstract: On Feb. 18, the state Department of Marine Resources ordered a two-year shutdown of lobster and crab harvesting in a 7-square-mile region at the mouth of the Penobscot River.

Full text:   The lobster fishery has been the one bright spot in Maine's seafood industry for years -- at least until last week.
On Feb. 18, the state Department of Marine Resources ordered a two-year shutdown of lobster and crab harvesting in a 7-square-mile region at the mouth of the Penobscot River. Mercury contamination from decades-old industrial pollution has reached high levels in the shellfish, and it should not be consumed, regulators say.
It's still unclear who knew about these high levels and for how long, and how many pounds of lobster and crab were harvested and consumed in the meantime.
What should be obvious to everyone, however, is how devastating an event like this could be to one of the state's most important industries and how even a small event could have huge impact on a valuable resource.
Too often, environmental regulation is cast as an impediment to economic growth, and businesspeople and their supporters in government insist that regulators can do the most good by simply getting out of the way.
That is not what was needed here.
Maine's economy is based on its natural resources, which are not limited to seafood such as lobster and crab or produce such as blueberries and potatoes. Maine sells its environment when it attracts tourists and other visitors who employ tens of thousands of Mainers all around the state, all year long.
The notion that Maine's lobsters could be unsafe to eat, or that Maine air and water might not be clean, could be devastating to those industries.
Far from being bad for business, environmental regulation is essential for business to succeed, especially the kinds of businesses that Maine depends on.
Unfortunately, ensuring that justice is done is a slow process. Mallinckrodt LLC, the company responsible for the mercury spilled by HoltraChem Manufacturing, is fighting in court to limit its role in the watershed's cleanup. The court should make sure that the company is held responsible, but prevention would have been better.
The next time we hear a politician complain about too much regulation, we should all remember this situation and reflect about how much trouble good regulation can avoid.

Full text:   Scientists who claimed that Maine officials knew for years about high levels of mercury in lobsters near the mouth of the Penobscot River reversed their account on Friday, saying they never notified the state about the hazardous mercury levels.
The scientists told two news outlets in separate interviews Thursday that they had shared those findings with state officials in reports issued in 2008 and 2009 and in a meeting in 2010, as they continued to work on a court-ordered study of mercury in the river.
But on Friday, after talking among themselves, the researchers said they had misremembered what information had been made available to the state and when it was made available. They said they realized that while state officials did have some information about above-normal mercury levels in lobsters by 2010, none of the data released to that point showed levels high enough to require immediate action.
Although the scientists had test results from 2008 at a site in South Verona that showed for the first time that lobsters had mercury contamination at more than twice the federal warning threshold for consumption, they did not share that information in either of their written reports or at their meeting with state officials in 2010.
"The information available to the state folks back in 2010 was not something that should have prompted firm action. It's the more recent data that's interesting," said Chris Whipple, a member of the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel and an environmental consultant for Environ International Corp. who specializes in radioactive waste, hazardous air pollutants and environmental mercury.
Without that 2008 data -- which only the study panel and its hired researchers had access to - state officials would not have known to act, he said.
John Rudd, chairman of the study panel, also scaled back a statement he made Thursday to the Portland Press Herald, that information about mercury contamination in lobsters had been "available now for a number of years" to state officials.
"They didn't have our more recent data until 2013," said Rudd, a scientist who specializes in freshwater fisheries and oceans and is president of Rudd and Kelly Research Inc. in Canada.
Whipple said his comments Friday differed from those he made Thursday to The Associated Press because another member of the research team contacted him to correct his recollection. He said he had not been contacted by any Maine state official.
The scientists spoke in response to a decision announced Tuesday by the state Department of Marine Resources, which ordered a two-year shutdown of lobster and crab harvesting in a seven-square-mile area where the river meets Penobscot Bay, effective today. The area is only a small fraction of the more than 14,000 square miles in the Gulf of Maine where lobsters are harvested.
The Department of Marine Resources decided to order the closure after receiving the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel's final, 1,800-page report in November and seeking a review of the findings by State Toxicologist Andrew Smith and a team of state analysts, which took three months.
The panel was formed under a judge's order in a federal lawsuit against the former HoltraChem Manufacturing Co., which is accused of dumping mercury waste into the river starting in 1967 and later into landfills at its plant in Orrington, which closed in 2000. Though the panel had completed the report and filed it in U.S. District Court in Bangor by April 19, 2013, state officials said they didn't receive it until the fall, after the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the Maine People's Alliance and the Natural Resources Defense Council, shared it with them.
The federal court case began in 2000, when the two groups sued HoltraChem Manufacturing and its inheritor, St. Louis-based Mallinckrodt LLC, over mercury contamination. The 2013 report is central to an upcoming trial in the case that will start on May 7.
Whipple said the members of the study panel held a workshop in September 2010 to explain the scope of what they had been commissioned to investigate. Representatives from the state Department of Environmental Protection, the attorney general's office, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the Department of Marine Resources, the University of Maine, several federal agencies, lawyers and those involved in the lawsuit attended the workshop.
"One of the reasons we held the workshop is, we knew the state agencies were interested in what we were doing because we were doing it in their backyard, and our work was somewhat mysterious to them," Whipple said.
Whipple said he thought initially, when he spoke to the media on Thursday, that detailed lobster studies had been presented at that workshop. He said he realized on Friday that all of the data shared at the meeting had been collected before 2007.
"At the time of that meeting, we had not done any lobster samples north of Fort Point Cove," Whipple said.
"Data from South Verona and Odom Ledge were not made available until April of 2013," Whipple said, referring to areas near the mouth of the river where the researchers found high mercury levels in lobsters in tests from 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012. "The farther north you get, the higher the mercury contamination."
Rudd said he now agrees with Whipple that state officials did not have the data from studies north of Fort Point Cove until 2013. But he said that data presented before 2010 indicated that lobster samples had mercury readings above 200 nanograms per gram of tissue, roughly the amount of mercury found in a can of white tuna.
Findings released in April 2013 show that lobsters taken from the South Verona sample site in 2008, 2009 and 2010 showed mercury levels ranging from just less than 400 nanograms per gram of meat to as much as 475.
Readings from lobsters taken during the same period at Odom Ledge ranged from less than 200 to more than 250 nanograms per gram of lobster meat, according to the panel's final report.
Smith, the state toxicologist, said 200 nanograms per gram of tissue is "the starting point at which we begin to consider recommending limits on fish/shellfish consumption," not the point at which consumption should be banned.
"We have a policy that if you cannot eat at least an eight-ounce meal of fish or shellfish per week without reaching the toxicity level, then we will begin to consider issuing an advisory," Smith said Friday. "We also have a policy that if you cannot eat at least a meal a month, then we say don't eat any at all."
Lobsters harvested elsewhere along the coast of Maine have an average mercury reading of about 50 nanograms per gram of lobster meat, he said earlier this week. Two average-size lobsters yield about eight ounces of meat.
"By way of example, if an average level of mercury in fish tissue was around 400 ng/g, we would recommend consumption limits of no more than four ounces per week," Smith said in an email Friday.
Smith, who was out of the office for part of this week, returned to work Friday to reassess what information the state received from the Penobscot River Mercury Study Panel before last fall and whether the state should have acted differently in light of that data.
"We would have found they could eat about a meal, an eight-ounce meal, per week and we would not have issued an advisory," Smith said.
The Press Herald sent a letter Thursday to Judge John Woodcock Jr., who is presiding over the federal case, asking him whether anyone involved in the court case had disclosed the discovery of hazardous levels of mercury to the public and, if not, why not.
Eric Storms, chief deputy clerk for U.S. District Court in Maine, said Friday that Woodcock cannot respond to that letter while the case is pending, for ethical reasons. Storms answered some of those questions in the judge's place.
"The court couldn't disseminate the report itself," Storms said. "The court has to be careful not to act as an advocate. This report itself is still in dispute."
Storms also said that information given to the Press Herald that a gag order had been imposed on parties in the case was inaccurate. The parties to the lawsuit and the panel of scientists, not the court itself, could have disseminated the report.
"The court has expressly allowed the study panel to have contact with other agencies to facilitate their work. It's just that they have to inform the court about that," Storms said.
Whipple, reached Friday afternoon to answer follow-up questions from the morning, said he had since been asked to limit his comments about the panel's work and refer anyone with questions to the published reports of its finding.

Full text:   As many new parents can attest, a new baby brings with it many mysteries. Considering children do not come with instruction manuals, it's up to Mom and Dad to learn the ropes through trial and error and with some advice from pediatricians, friends and relatives.
One error new parents commonly make is introducing solid foods to their infants before the tots are ready. The American Academy of Pediatrics and Health Canada now recommend infants should not start solid foods until age six months. Breast milk or infant formula should be the food of choice for infants younger than six months.
A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity and Obesity surveyed 1,334 women before they gave birth, and nearly every month during the first year of the child's life. Mothers were asked to report feeding habits. Forty percent of mothers gave their babies solid foods prior to age four months. The most common reason for giving the food was the mothers believed the baby was old enough to begin eating solid foods. Mothers also said that the baby seemed hungry a lot and was not satiated by breast milk or formula alone. More than 50 percent of mothers in the study responded that a doctor told them the baby could start solid food before four months old.
Children who are introduced to solid foods too early may not be developmentally ready to accept these foods. Studies also have linked the early introduction of solid foods with an increased risk of chronic diseases, such as obesity and eczema, later in life. Babies also may not be physically able to move their tongues and swallow properly to handle solid foods. Here are some guidelines for knowing when and how to introduce solid foods to a baby's diet.
[bullet] Recognize readiness signs. Signs that your child is ready for solid foods include the ability to sit up and lean forward, good head control, the ability to pick up food and try to put it in his or her mouth and the ability to turn his or her head away to indicate fullness. If the baby watches you while eat and seems interested in your food, this may also indicate a readiness for solid food.
[bullet] Adhere to the recommended guidelines. Breast milk and formula are nutritionally sound food sources for growing babies. Introducing complementary foods too early can lead to nutrient deficiency.
[bullet] Begin with one food at a time. Most pediatricians recommend starting out with iron-fortified cereals as the first solid foods because they're least likely to cause an allergic reaction. These cereals can be diluted with milk or formula to make them more palatable. Others prefer to start with an iron-rich vegetable. Good starter vegetables include sweet potatoes, squash and peas. Before adding any more solid foods, stick with the initial food for at least one week or more to determine if the child can tolerate the food.
[bullet] Pay attention for signs of allergies. Rashes, wheezing, gas, fussiness, vomiting, and diarrhea could be indicative of a food allergy. If your child exhibits such symptoms, stop giving him or her the food and consult your pediatrician. Wait until your baby is at least one year of age before introducing foods that commonly cause allergies, including citrus foods, shellfish, nuts, and egg whites.
[bullet] Avoid honey. Honey can contain life-threatening botulism. It should be kept off the menu until your child reaches his or her first birthday. Many parents wait until a child becomes a toddler before introducing honey.
Introducing solid foods to infants should only be done when the child is developmentally ready.

Full text:   Shell of an idea: Make 'em cash cow
A Canadian businessman says he has a solution to the population explosion of green crabs, which are ravaging Maine's valuable shellfish industry: Put the crabs on menus around the world.
"We are going to take that invasive species and turn it into gold," said Ron Howse, president and CEO of the Tidalwater Seafood Co., based in Fredericton, New Brunswick.
Howse, who has no background in the seafood industry, plans to process green crabs in Maine and market the meat and live crabs to customers in Japan, Korea, China, Spain and Portugal. He said Asian and European consumers will pay good money for green crabs, which are pests in Maine because they eat clams and mussels, steal bait from lobster traps, destroy eelgrass beds and damage salt marshes.
Howse, 65, said he's looking at opening a processing plant in the Brunswick or Bangor area to pick the meat from green crabs, and he may set up holding facilities along the Maine coast. He said there's also a significant market for live crabs, which could be shipped to Asia and Europe on flights from Bangor International Airport.
Howse said there's enough money to finance the business plan if he gets some financial support from community development groups in the state. He said he has significant private funds available, but he wouldn't provide details about the amount of money he has or the amount he would need to raise.
Clam diggers and marine resource managers are cautiously optimistic that Howse has come up with a workable business solution, something that would be remarkable because all other attempts have failed.
The crabs have no commercial value now, in part because their bodies are so small that the meat can't be removed efficiently. Some composting companies will take the crabs, but they won't pay for them. Recent attempts to create a market for them as bait or cat food have gone nowhere.
Clam diggers hope Howse's plan will work but still have a "wait-and-see" attitude, said Daniel Devereaux, who manages the clam flats in Brunswick as the town's marine warden.
"I have eaten them," he said. "They are great-tasting. You've just got to eat 300 of them."
If nothing is done to reduce the green crab population, clam diggers will be out of business in two years, said Steve Follette, 67, a clam digger who co-chairs the Frenchman Bay Regional Shellfish Conservation Committee in Down East Maine.
"It's going to give everyone an incentive to trap them," he said of Howse's plan. "If you make your living out of the sea, you would be stupid not to."
An adult European green crab is typically about 2½ inches long. It is distinguished from other crabs by five pointed spines on the outside of each eye and three small, rounded spines between the eyes.
The crabs arrived in Maine waters nearly 100 years ago, and their population goes through boom-and-bust cycles, said Denis Nault, supervisor of the shellfish management program at the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
He said the population is now at the highest level the state has ever seen, and Casco Bay is being hit the hardest.
Clam diggers Down East expect the population boom will move up the coast and strike their mud flats next year, Follette said.
"It's a wave that is unbelievable. It's like a science fiction movie," he said.
In preparation for the dredging of Portland Harbor, crews have been trapping and moving lobsters this winter. Over a one-month period that ended Jan. 27, they captured 28,219 green crabs in the process.
They have been killing the crabs and dumping their bodies at sea. Howse said he plans to buy 80 pounds from the crews on Thursday. He has been paying harvesters 50 cents a pound.
Nault said attempts to create a commercial fishery for green crabs and use them for cat food or bait have failed because the prices are too low to justify the cost of harvesting, processing and transportation. Marketing the crabs as food for people has a better chance of success because it would increase the value.
He said the state issues permits to towns for crab eradication efforts, and the state would be able to issue more permits if there were a viable commercial fishery. One issue is that the traps must be designed so that fishermen catch crabs, and not juvenile lobsters.
With green crabs, Nault said, overharvesting won't be a problem.
"You are not going to eliminate this critter," he said.

Full text:   I am writing in response to the article on Jan. 23 regarding the worming and clamming industry.
I dug worms for 40-plus years. I am now retired, but I have seen this animosity between the two groups happen for years.
Did anyone ever check to see how many clam diggers also have worm digger licenses so they can dig worms during red tide shutdowns when the clam flats are closed?
It didn't used to be this way until the state gave towns the right to control licensing. By doing this, the towns took away the livelihood of a lot of diggers who used to dig both clams and worms.
This has caused the animosity between the two groups because wormers can no longer dig clams, but there is no restriction against clammers digging worms.
I believe that nothing happens when worm diggers complain to the state about circumstances that threaten their livelihood.
When clam diggers complain about circumstances that threaten their livelihood, however, the state seems to consistently support their concerns over the concerns of worm diggers.

Full text:   15 INTERESTING HISTORIC SITES TO VISIT
ALONG THE COAST AND RIVERS OF MAINE
By David B. MacNab
Maine Authors Publishing, 2013
86 pages, $17.95
ISBN 978-1-938883-61-3

A wise British politician once said: "A country losing touch with its own history is like an old man losing his glasses, a distressing sight, at once vulnerable, unsure and easily distracted."
For that reason, it is important for Mainers to know their own state history, and David MacNab's first book is a clever travel guide featuring 15 historic sites along the Maine coast and its rivers -- from far Down East at an early French settlement on St. Croix Island near Calais, south to Fort McClary (c.1808) at Kittery Point.
This slim volume is a handy reference for finding such interesting places as the Whaleback Shell Midden near Damariscotta, where ancient people 2,000 years ago gathered to harvest shellfish, and the Percy and Small Shipyard at the Maine Maritime Museum in Bath where the great schooners were built from 1897 to 1920. Nine of the sites highlight forts and blockhouses reflecting Maine's military history from colonial times to the Civil War.
The book is well-organized, providing detailed information on directions, access, admission, contact data and unique details such as parking availability and whether the sites are open seasonally or all year. MacNab also wisely includes descriptions and histories of the sites.
Learn how and why forts and blockhouses were built, why a Civil War vice president of the United States also served as the company cook in a Maine militia unit, what it was like to be imprisoned in the Old York Gaol in 1656 and about the American traitor who rested at Fort Western in Augusta in 1775.
For more interesting reading about Maine history, see "Rivers of Fortune: Where Tides and Money Flowed" by Bill Caldwell (Downeast Books, 1983) and "Eminent Mainers" by Arthur Douglas Stover (Tilbury House, 2006).

FINAL SETTLEMENT:
A DARBY FARR MYSTERY
By Vicki Doudera
Midnight Ink, 2013
325 pages, $14.99
ISBN 978-0-7387-3428-6
Lorraine Delvecchio is a neat, mousy woman with hyperthymesia -- the uncanny ability to remember everything. Otherwise an unremarkable woman, maybe it is her memory that gets her killed. But dead she is, and most folks in Hurricane Harbor, Maine, can't figure out why. Five people know, and they're not talking.
"Final Settlement" is Camden author Vicki Doudera's fourth book in her mystery series (after "Deadly Offer") featuring real estate agent and amateur sleuth Darby Farr. Doudera is herself a mid-coast realtor as well as a mystery writer.
Despite several unconvincing scenes and detail inconsistencies, this is an entertaining mystery -- fun to read and easy to follow, with just enough suspense and action to keep everyone guessing.
Darby is back in her hometown to attend the February wedding of her best friend, Tina. Lorraine's death, however, puzzles the local police chief who asks for Darby's help in discovering the truth. The investigating detective concludes Lorraine's death was accidental, but Darby and the chief don't believe it.
Wedding preparations during a bitterly cold Maine blizzard are no fun, but the tragic result of a deadly cop shooting convinces Darby that her hunch is right -- Lorraine was murdered, but why?
As she follows some cryptic clues, she learns that lots of people are happy to see Lorraine dead for a wide variety of reasons, and everyone is lying. A coded journal leads her to an unusual list of suspects with seemingly nothing in common.
A curious and lethal side plot -- unrelated to Lorraine's murder -- surfaces that puts Darby's life in jeopardy. But Lorraine's killer has murdered again, and Darby may be the next victim. Nobody here gets killed over a real estate deal gone bad. The real motive for murder is much more basic, insidious and dangerous.
Bill Bushnell lives and writes in Harpswell.

LL Bean's grandson donates 'precious resource'

Full text:   The island near Yarmouth harbor where L.L. Bean hunted for ducks in the 1930s and where rare birds still nest each year will be preserved in perpetuity for the public to enjoy, a statewide conservation group said Monday.
The family of Leon Gorman, grandson of Leon L. Bean, donated the 28-acre Lanes Island, adding to the growing list of more than 300 islands preserved by Maine Coast Heritage Trust.
The trust's president, Tim Glidden, called the island a "precious resource" in a statement announcing the preservation.
"With more people realizing what a unique quality of life and place there is in this region, it is essential that we continue the important work of maintaining and expanding public access to the land," Glidden said. "We are grateful to Leon and Lisa Gorman for their vision and generosity in making this gift."
The Gorman family began purchasing portions of the island in 1968 before acquiring the final segment in 2010.
The trust will work in the coming months to form a management plan to balance the preservation of habitat with the new opportunities for public boating, hiking and camping. Clammers also harvest shellfish each year from the mudflats surrounding Lanes Island, but their activity will not be affected by the donation, said Nat Tupper, Yarmouth town manager. The island had generated about $8,800 in tax revenue per year for the town before preservation, Tupper said.
The island was originally named after James Lane, of Malden, Mass., who acquired it and another parcel on the mainland during the period when Massachusetts Bay Colony residents were offered land grants in what is now Maine.
In 1658, Lane settled in what was called North Yarmouth -- in present-day Yarmouth -- until he was killed by Native Americans and his family fled back to Massachusetts, according to a 1902 book of Lane family genealogy, which is preserved by the Yarmouth Historical Society.
According to the same historical account, the island was known as a headquarters for local Native American fishermen and served as a meeting place and burial ground, said Michael Chaney, director of the Yarmouth Historical Society.
"Tradition marks the island as the place where the Indians planted corn, held councils, tortured their captives and buried their dead," Chaney said, reading from the historical document.
Research by the society backs up the claim that the island was a burial ground, Chaney said. As early as 1833, settlers recorded finding bones buried in the sand.
Along with continued human use, the state has also recognized the island as ecologically significant because of the waterfowl and shorebirds that nest there, including bald eagles.
The Maine Coast Heritage Trust is working toward preserving two other islands. Across the bay in Harpswell, the trust is working to acquire the Goslings, two small islands with a history of public access under private ownership. If successful, acquiring Goslings would complement the trust's recent conservation of a portion of neighboring Lower Goose Island.
A separate fundraising effort is under way to buy and preserve roughly half of Clapboard Island in Falmouth, which had been under private ownership since 1898 and remains closed to public use.
The Maine Coast Heritage Trust has placed the Clapboard Island land under contract for about $1.4 million, but needs to raise the money to complete the project. On Monday, a representative from the trust presented a funding pitch to Falmouth town councilors.
The purchase plan calls for the town to pitch in between $300,000 and $500,000, depending on the success of fundraising and how much is netted from the sale of a cottage that stands on Clapboard Island, said Keith Fletcher, a project manager at Maine Coast Heritage Trust.
Along with the town and private donors, the Pew Foundantion has pledged to match a portion of funds raised to purchase Clapboard.

Full text:   handyman would be handy
I can get my house painted inside and out, new windows put in, a complete roof remake. I can get my lawn mowed, raked and seeded. I can have a new boiler put in, the basement redone, floors polished and my dog groomed. But I can't find anyone to fix a drawer.
The drawer is in the upstairs bathroom. It's part of an oversized vanity, much like my own. It has two big drawers, hers and mine. Wouldn't you know that it's mine that's broken? It appears that the sliding fixtures have detached somewhere in the back,and the drawer sort of hangs there like Quasimodo, who has forgotten where the bells are.
I tried fixing it myself and for a piece of time, it worked; then, like everything else I've fixed in life, such as my daughter's tricycle, it came undone and it's hanging there.
The problem is the once-ubiquitous handyman has faded from the American scene.
There was a time when I was younger, back around the time Franklin Roosevelt defeated Wendell Willkie, that the landscape was sprinkled with handymen. It was an honorable profession, almost like being a bus driver or school janitor. Every American neighborhood from St. Louis to New Orleans to Waterville had one or two.
When not working fixing porches, banisters, window sashes and cellar doors, one could be found up on a ladder somewhere or sitting in a corner table at the local diner, sipping soup or munching on the daily blue plate special. He had a universal costume - old blue jeans or work khaki pants carried over from the last parts of his First or Second World War uniform.
Maybe he had a worn leather fading bomber jacket worn over a denim shirt, and he looked like an older Tommy Lee Jones, wearing that stained old fedora, slumped over a bowl of soup or standing on the corner, trying to light a Camel cigarette in the wind.
In my childhood, I knew such a man. His name was Barney, and he lived with his mother on the top floor of a two-family flat across the street from the Catholic church.
Barney walked with a slight limp favoring his right side. One of the firemen at the firehouse said it was because that's where he carried his tool box. Mr. Schneider at the drug store said that he had lost the lower part of his right leg at Pearl Harbor, and that was sad, he said, because he had been a great baseball player in high school.
In the late '30s, when I was old enough to start being aware of things like that, there were men and boys everywhere to fix things. But then my father died without saying goodbye, and Pearl Harbor was bombed and suddenly the family handymen were gone. Then somewhere around 1944, Barney was there, limping down Soper Street with his tool box, and all the widows and blue and gold star mothers were hiring him to patch up their neglected homes.
It worked like this. If my mother got tired of stepping over the broken board on the back porch, she would send me up the street to Barney's house. I would knock on the door, and his mother, who worked for Father Keating across the street, would come to the door wiping her hands on her apron that had pictures of autumn leaves on it. You remember things like that when you're a strange, lonely little boy with no brothers around.
I would ask her then, "Is Barney home?" He never was. She would tell me where he was working in the neighborhood, or that he was having chili for lunch at Auel's cafe on the corner. Then I would go there and find him and tell him that my mother needed him.
He would listen to me and nod, and say he'd be over.
Sometimes he would give me the extra oyster crackers that came with his chili.
So here I am, some hundred years later, with a broken drawer and no Barney; and my brothers, who were always good at fixing things, are all gone to the other side.
I asked around today, and everyone said they were all busy plowing snow or painting a house or building one. If you have a Barney in your neighborhood, let me know. I'll walk over and see if he's home.

Full text:   In general, people tend to denote the passing of time by the four seasons. Hunters, on the other hand, recognize it is often the transitions between the seasons that are of greatest importance. And as we turn the calendar page from November to December we enter a significant transition period between fall and winter.
For many (but not all) deer hunters, the season is over. Firearms hunters represent the bulk of the group and their season ends the Saturday after Thanksgiving. There are far fewer of them, but the deer are still out there and so will be a small contingent of hardy souls who brave the bitter cold armed with muzzleloaders, or bows in the expanded archery zones.
It's a different game now. Wary whitetails have been chased around for more than a month and their numbers thinned considerably, making them harder to find. Locating concentrated food sources becomes a priority for both hunter and hunted, and a stationary hunter would do well to set up among the oaks or near a well-managed food plot. More restless hunters might do well to pair up and ease through the brush, possibly putting a hiding buck on its feet.
Meanwhile mobile hunters should also have the advantage of snow. Fresh snow means every track is new and at the other end is the animal that made it. The contest becomes following it to the source without being detected.
Regardless of whether tags are filled, a third, smaller faction of deer hunters will switch to lighter caliber weapons and try to match wits with wily predators like coyotes and bobcats. Some will call, others sit over bait stations and some will run hounds. For the latter it is the chase that matters most. But for all, a successful conclusion to the hunt also means there may be a few more deer around next season.
With most of the deer hunters out of the woods, upland bird hunters and their dogs get a chance for some late-season action. Unable to probe their bills into the frozen soil in search of worms, the woodcock have flown south. But grouse remain in their native haunts and the leafless trees afford open shooting.
Upland gunners may find a few remnant pheasants in stocked areas as well. Few of these non-native birds will last the winter, those not falling to the gun will succumb to predators and the elements, so there's little harm to the population in thinning them now.
Waterfowl and waterfowlers alike are transitioning toward the coast. As smaller ponds and streams ice over, birds move first toward larger inland water bodies and waterways. When those freeze some birds head south while others move to the coast, where blacks and mallards will raft up along rocky shores and tidal marshes.
Meanwhile, the cold weather has also pushed down divers -- buffleheads and goldeneyes -- along with increasingly larger numbers of eiders and old squaw. Some of the frailer sea ducks -- such as scoters -- have moved on, but the eiders and diminutive distant cousins will remain in coastal waters through the winter, fattening up on shellfish and crustaceans.
This is not a sport for the faint of heart or ill-prepared wildfowler. Hunters and dogs must be equipped to handle often harsh conditions, but sometimes the coldest temperatures provide the hottest shooting action.
As the month winds on and the calendar marks the official change of seasons, we'll experience another transition. A few hardy souls will continue to gun the icy ocean waters and predator hunters will ramp up their activity. But a good many sportsmen will hang up the guns and haul out the ice traps and snowmobiles.

Full text:   I can get my house painted inside and out, new windows put in, a complete roof remake. I can get my lawn mowed, raked and seeded. I can have a new boiler put in, the basement redone, floors polished and my dog groomed. But I can't find anyone to fix a drawer.
The drawer is in the upstairs bathroom. It's part of an oversized vanity, much like my own. It has two big drawers, hers and mine. Wouldn't you know that it's mine that's broken? It appears that the sliding fixtures have detached somewhere in the back,and the drawer sort of hangs there like Quasimodo, who has forgotten where the bells are.
I tried fixing it myself and for a piece of time, it worked; then, like everything else I've fixed in life, such as my daughter's tricycle, it came undone and it's hanging there.
The problem is the once-ubiquitous handyman has faded from the American scene.
There was a time when I was younger, back around the time Franklin Roosevelt defeated Wendell Willkie, that the landscape was sprinkled with handymen. It was an honorable profession, almost like being a bus driver or school janitor. Every American neighborhood from St. Louis to New Orleans to Waterville had one or two.
When not working fixing porches, banisters, window sashes and cellar doors, one could be found up on a ladder somewhere or sitting in a corner table at the local diner, sipping soup or munching on the daily blue plate special. He had a universal costume - old blue jeans or work khaki pants carried over from the last parts of his First or Second World War uniform.
Maybe he had a worn leather fading bomber jacket worn over a denim shirt, and he looked like an older Tommy Lee Jones, wearing that stained old fedora, slumped over a bowl of soup or standing on the corner, trying to light a Camel cigarette in the wind.
In my childhood, I knew such a man. His name was Barney, and he lived with his mother on the top floor of a two-family flat across the street from the Catholic church.
Barney walked with a slight limp favoring his right side. One of the firemen at the firehouse said it was because that's where he carried his tool box. Mr. Schneider at the drug store said that he had lost the lower part of his right leg at Pearl Harbor, and that was sad, he said, because he had been a great baseball player in high school.
In the late '30s, when I was old enough to start being aware of things like that, there were men and boys everywhere to fix things. But then my father died without saying goodbye, and Pearl Harbor was bombed and suddenly the family handymen were gone. Then somewhere around 1944, Barney was there, limping down Soper Street with his tool box, and all the widows and blue and gold star mothers were hiring him to patch up their neglected homes.
It worked like this. If my mother got tired of stepping over the broken board on the back porch, she would send me up the street to Barney's house. I would knock on the door, and his mother, who worked for Father Keating across the street, would come to the door wiping her hands on her apron that had pictures of autumn leaves on it. You remember things like that when you're a strange, lonely little boy with no brothers around.
I would ask her then, "Is Barney home?" He never was. She would tell me where he was working in the neighborhood, or that he was having chili for lunch at Auel's cafe on the corner. Then I would go there and find him and tell him that my mother needed him.
He would listen to me and nod, and say he'd be over.
Sometimes he would give me the extra oyster crackers that came with his chili.
So here I am, some hundred years later, with a broken drawer and no Barney; and my brothers, who were always good at fixing things, are all gone to the other side.
I asked around today, and everyone said they were all busy plowing snow or painting a house or building one. If you have a Barney in your neighborhood, let me know. I'll walk over and see if he's home.

Full text:   An early morning fire at Boone's Fish House and Oyster Room on Portland's waterfront on Wednesday has closed the restaurant temporarily.
The seafood restaurant, located on Custom House Wharf at 86 Commercial St., is expected to reopen on Saturday after some quick repairs, said Boone's manager Andre Gennitti.
The fire started around 4 a.m. in a wood frame around the restaurant's central fireplace, damaging the flooring around the fireplace and the floorboards on the second floor, Gennitti said.
"Our fireplace kind of went overboard," he said. "The smoke damage was so minor, and there was no actual fire damage. We will be able to get rolling soon."
Gennitti said the Portland Fire Department did a great job removing the floor, causing minimal damage. He said the flooring will have to be reinstalled and the restaurant will have to be cleaned and inspected before it can reopen.
"It could have been a lot worse," he said.
Boone's, owned by chef Harding Lee Smith, is Smith's fourth and newest restaurant in Portland. It opened in August.
Portland Fire Capt. Phil McGouldrick said his department has yet to complete a final report. He described the damage as "minor to moderate."
The department was notified by a built-in fire alarm system at 4:03 a.m., and the first crews to respond reported back that there was smoke in the building, prompting a second "all hands" call for a working fire, McGouldrick said.
"The early notification of the built-in fire alarm system really helped us out."
There's no downplaying the value of a working fire alarm system," he said, adding that firefighters put out the fire and left the restaurant by 7:44 a.m.

Abstract: An emailed version of that picture made its way to the headmaster's office and then the Maine Attorney General's Office, which determined that the 16-year-old driver of the car, which advertised a brand of e-cigarettes being imported and distributed by her family's business, was not breaking any laws by parking it on campus. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, between 2011 and 2012 the percentage of children in grades 6- through 12 who said they'd used the battery-operated cigarettes increased from 3.3 percent to 6.8 percent.

Full text:   Toby Simon had just dropped off her daughter at Thornton Academy in Saco when she noticed a white Kia Optima wrapped in an advertising banner for SmokeEnds e-cigarettes with the slogan "Your HABIT ... Made BETTER." A tobacco policy specialist, Simon was perturbed by the car's presence on campus. "I just kind of sat there for a while," she said. "Then I got out and took a picture."
An emailed version of that picture made its way to the headmaster's office and then the Maine Attorney General's Office, which determined that the 16-year-old driver of the car, which advertised a brand of e-cigarettes being imported and distributed by her family's business, was not breaking any laws by parking it on campus.
Some boundary had been crossed, though, of both school policy and social protocol. The girl's mother, Carrie Gorham, the founder of SmokeEnds, agreed that her daughter would park it off campus from now on. But the scenario typifies the gray area around e-cigarettes. In this tale of two mothers, Gorham sees them as the wave of the future and the lesser of two evils. Simon worries they represent another way for the tobacco industry to make a buck on nicotine addicts and find new, younger customers.
E-cigarettes have been available in the American marketplace for about five years and are, as Amber Desrosiers, the tobacco policy coordinator for Maine's attorney general, puts it, undeniably "up and coming." Movie star Leonardo DiCaprio has been photographed with one for years. Reported usage doubled between 2010 and 2011, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Annual sales are expected to top $1 billion this year.
However, the level of confusion around the battery-operated devices hasn't dissipated as they've moved beyond novelty, in no small part because the Federal Drug Administration has yet to issue regulations for e-cigarettes.
The long-term health effects are not yet clear, and neither are the societal aspects of using them. They look like cigarettes and they deliver a hit of nicotine, an alkaloid that raises blood pressure, but should the smoker duck outside a restaurant to use them, or push back from the table and have an e-cigarette with his coffee? In a television ad for Blu, the e-cigarette made by the tobacco company Lorillard, the actor Stephen Dorff promises you can light up a Blu "virtually everywhere." What he can't promise, legally, is that they will get you to quit nicotine; but the fact that he can espouse the virtues of e-cigarettes on television, where tobacco ads have been banned for decades, is yet another signifier of that gray area.
All this ambiguity is deeply frustrating to Ed Miller, spokesman for the American Lung Association's Maine chapter. "It's the wild, wild West out there," he said.
The lung association's stance is that smoke-free laws should be applied to e-cigarettes, even if what comes out of them is vapor rather than secondhand smoke. Miller cites a German study that found trace amounts of formaldehyde and benzine in the vapor emissions. But while no one seems to be able to locate any definitive research, more people are discovering the products.
One of the key statistics that fuels Miller and Simon's concern and the nationwide debate about e-cigarettes is the increase in the number of middle and high school students who say they have tried them. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, between 2011 and 2012 the percentage of children in grades 6- through 12 who said they'd used the battery-operated cigarettes increased from 3.3 percent to 6.8 percent. And e-cigarettes come in such flavors as chocolate, orange, caramel and even, if you hunt for it online, something called Cap'n Crunch Berries.
"The e-cigarette industry is really taking its tactics from the cigarette industry on how it is marketing to the kids," Miller said. "It's ripped from big tobacco's playbook."
When it comes to that SmokeEnds car on the Thornton Academy campus, Carrie Gorham would disagree vehemently. Her reasons for letting her daughter drive the car to school had everything to do with convenience, not marketing.
"Are there are companies out there doing that?" she said. "Oh, my God, yes, and we combat them every single day."
If she were selling regular cigarettes and driving a car wrapped in, say, Marlboro advertisements, she never would have let her child drive it to school. But she feels so good about the business she started three years ago, shortly after throwing her last seven traditional cigarettes into a mud puddle, that she sometimes forgets that others might not feel the same way.
"We are trying to save people," Gorham said. "I feel that we are making a difference in this world." She tiptoes around the word "healthy," careful not to make promises she knows are false. "All I know is this is a far better alternative."
A former dog groomer, she was spurred to start the Kennebunk-based business by the death of her former mother-in-law. "She died of a massive heart attack at 62 with a cigarette in her mouth," Gorham said. During that time, when Gorham was heartbroken and disgusted with her own "horrible" habit, her husband, Steve, introduced her to e-cigarettes. She liked one brand but found them hard to find and decided that she wanted to go into the distribution business herself.
Eventually that led to trademarking her own brand and working with a factory in China, where the first e-cigarettes were produced. Now they have several employees, including Carrie's brother John Graham, and seven cars in the SmokeEnds fleet. Most of them, Gorham points out, are hybrids. She worries about the environment. She cares about cancer victims. She said she raised $500 for a breast cancer patient who needed wigs by selling e-cigarettes with a pink cartridge. Her customers are grateful. "People are so excited," she said. "It's like a breath of fresh air to still smoke but without all the bad crap."
While it's true that e-cigarettes don't contain tar, they do contain nicotine -- otherwise they'd do nothing for the person with the chemical addiction to the tobacco product. A battery in an e-cigarette fires a heating coil, which warms a liquid containing nicotine. When the user inhales, it produces a nicotine vapor.
Demonstrating, Gorham exhales out her nose like a practiced cigarette smoker, but there's more of a sense of something light passing through the air than an actual smell. She calls it smoking -- old habits --but the industry name for what you do with an e-cigarette is "vaping."
The FDA's proposed regulations on e-cigarettes were expected in October, but the government shutdown slowed that process, and an FDA representative said the agency can't speculate on timing. In September, Maine Attorney General Janet T. Mills joined with 39 other state and territorial attorneys general in calling for the FDA to place restrictions on them by classifying them as "tobacco products" under the Tobacco Control Act. This would limit the advertising and marketing of e-cigarettes to youth.
As the CDC noted in its report on the use of e-cigarettes by people under 18, there are other components in the e-cigarettes, including a component to produce the aerosol, which could be propylene glycol or glycerol. In addition, the CDC report said "potentially harmful constituents also have been documented in some e-cigarette cartridges, including irritants, genotoxins, and animal carcinogens." These ingredients are untested and vary from one product to another.
"The consumer has no idea what's in there," Miller said. The flavorings are another factor. For Miller, they are a clear indication that the industry, which produces 200 to 250 brands, is catering to a youthful market.
Carrie Gorham doesn't see it that way. As she vaped from an orange-flavored cartridge at a Scarborough restaurant, she said she favors a flavored e-cigarette because her taste buds, damaged from years of smoking regular cigarettes, crave a flavor agent.
Her vaping went unnoticed by a waitress and the rest of the staff, which local restaurateurs say is common.
At Foreplay in Portland, bar manager Jeff Nappi said he'd hardly seen anyone using e-cigarettes in the bar in recent years. There's one regular who used them for a while, he said, but that person went outside to do so. At J's Oyster, a waitress who vapes also goes outside. E-cigarettes have not been a factor at DiMillo's restaurant, except for one server who uses them in public areas.
"It raises some eyebrows, but in my opinion doesn't ruffle too many feathers," owner Johnny DiMillo wrote in an email. "I wouldn't deter any of our diners from using these devices any more than the occasional obnoxious kid with a beeping and buzzing cell phone or iPad totally disengaged from the rest of their dining group."
But the lack of direction from the FDA leaves business owners unclear on how to proceed.
"I was wondering what I would say if someone pulled one out at Becky's," said Becky Rand, whose Becky's Diner is a popular waterfront destination. "Don't they produce a vapor? For people who haven't heard of them, there are going to be some questions." Her inclination is to ask e-cigarette users to step outside, but she has sympathy for smokers "because they are addicted, and it is just the way the cigarette companies want them to be," she said.
She struggled to keep both her smoking customers and her nonsmoking customers happy in the days before Portland eliminated indoor smoking, she said. Being banished outside wasn't popular with the smokers, but "they are used to being second-class citizens on this issue," she said.
Gorham would agree with this. "We haven't been citizens of the United States for 10 years," she said.
And then, once more, over pizza and in public, she vaped.

"I wouldn't deter any of our diners from using these devices any more than the occasional obnoxious kid with a beeping and buzzing cell phone or iPad totally disengaged from the rest of their dining group."
But the lack of direction from the FDA leaves business owners unclear on how to proceed.
"I was wondering what I would say if someone pulled one out at Becky's," said Becky Rand, whose Becky's Diner is a popular waterfront destination. "Don't they produce a vapor? For people who haven't heard of them, there are going to be some questions." Her inclination is to ask e-cigarette users to step outside, but she has sympathy for smokers "because they are addicted, and it is just the way the cigarette companies want them to be," she said.
She struggled to keep both her smoking customers and her nonsmoking customers happy in the days before Portland eliminated indoor smoking, she said. Being banished outside wasn't popular with the smokers, but "they are used to being second-class citizens on this issue," she said.
Gorham would agree with this. "We haven't been citizens of the United States for 10 years," she said.
And then, once more, over pizza and in public, she vaped.

Food safety inspections at Maine's seafood processing plants are delayed by a few weeks because of the federal government shutdown, state officials said. They also said if the shuttering persists, it could cause more severe problems with the annual seafood inspection program.
"It has so far had a minimal impact on us. If it went on for too long, we would have to analyze what we could do," said Ron Dyer, director of quality assurance and regulations at the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
As part of the sweeping Food and Drug Administration food safety program, the FDA contracts with Maine, and the state performs 32 unannounced safety inspections per year at Maine's approximately 40 seafood processing plants. Maine receives about $800 for each inspection, or nearly $26,000 per year from the FDA. The U.S. Department of Agriculture inspects meat, poultry and egg products, while the FDA inspects seafood and all other food products.
The FDA works with Maine to schedule eight inspections per quarter. Because 2013's fourth quarter started Oct. 1, the same day that the federal government shutdown began, the fall and winter schedule has not been set.
Dyer said he's not sure if the state would be permitted to temporarily pick up the cost of the program if the shutdown continues. He said once the federal government reopens, the seafood inspections could begin late this year or simply be shifted to 2014.
Dyer said the state may do abbreviated inspections of the seafood processing plants in the interim.
, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.
While seafood inspections have been delayed a few weeks, meat and poultry inspections continue unabated, Dyer said, because they fall under the USDA program. Meat inspectors were considered essential employees under the shutdown and continued working, Dyer said.
Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate failed to agree to a deal by Tuesday evening, according to news reports, although speculation that a bipartisan Senate-led deal would break the impasse seemed to indicate the end of the partisan wrangling was near. If a deal is not brokered by Thursday, when the debt ceiling is reached, it could damage credibility in financial markets, raising doubt that the U.S. pays its bills, according to numerous news reports.
Among the myriad problems caused by the shutown are furloughs of employees related to food safety that could haunt the U.S. if allowed to continue, said Amanda Hitt, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Food Integrity Campaign, a nonprofit watchdog group.
Hitt said that while the meat, poultry and egg inspectors so far have been considered essential employees, furloughing back-office USDA employees eventually could snarl operations, such as the ability to deliver labels, including recall labels for contaminated food.
Hitt said so far the food supply is not being jeopardized to a substantial degree, but if the shutdown continues, the U.S. could be heading into dangerous territory.
"We do not want to roll the dice with the safety of the U.S. food supply," Hitt said. "One little hiccup could lead to quite a disaster. You could have the possibility for massive illnesses."
While the USDA retained its meat inspectors during the shutdown, the FDA furloughed 45 percent of its employees, some of whom are involved in food safety, according to government documents.
According to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services memo, "routine establishment" inspections of food industry facilities are suspended during the shutdown.
"The FDA will be unable to support the majority of its food safety, nutrition, and cosmetics activities. FDA will also have to cease safety activities such as routine establishment inspections, some compliance and enforcement activities, monitoring of imports, notification programs (e.g., food contact substances, infant formula), and the majority of the laboratory research necessary to inform public health decision-making," according to the memo.
The memo noted, however, that nearly 700 FDA employees related to food safety inspections would remain on the job during the shutdown.
In one example of how inspections can affect the seafood industry, the FDA temporarily shut down Portland Shellfish Co. in 2011 and 2012 for safety violations, and required the company to improve sanitary conditions.

Chefs Jon Gaboric and Chris Long work side by side at Natalie's, the restaurant at the Camden Harbour Inn, so they've always had a little friendly competition.
In October, they will go head-to-head in the Maine Lobster Chef of the Year contest at Harvest on the Harbor, Portland's annual food and wine festival.
This time, the competition might not be so friendly.
"He's been threatening to take the rubber bands off my lobsters before I can get to them," Long said Thursday at the news conference announcing details of this year's festival.
Nearly 5,000 people came to Portland last year to sample local food and sip wine at Harvest on the Harbor, which will be held Oct. 23 to 26 this year. Ticket sales so far show that visitors will be coming from five foreign countries and 29 states.
The Portland Convention and Visitors' Bureau estimates that the festival pumps more than $2 million into the local economy.
"It's important that we do this event after the busy summer tourist season, and after our fall foliage season, so we can encourage visitors to continue to come into our state and to visit our restaurants, to shop in our stores and to attend the many wonderful galleries and attractions that we have," said Barbara Whitten, president of the bureau.
The Maine Lobster Chef of the Year competition is one of the festival's most popular events. This year, for the first time, it sold out even before the competitors were announced.
This is also the first time two chefs from the same restaurant have competed against each other.
"He did his dish, and I was like, 'I can do that better,' and here we both are," said Long, a line chef at Natalie's.
Gaboric, the executive chef at Natalie's, said he'll make butter-poached lobster with pickled radishes, corn miso puree and geoduck dressing. (A geoduck is a large saltwater clam.)
Long's dish will be butter-poached lobster with a parsnip and squash ragout.
In addition to Gaboric and Long, chef Shanna O'Hea of the restaurant Academe at the Kennebunk Inn will compete, with her take on lobster lo mein -- with a seared piece of pork belly on top.
"I think competition is always fun," O'Hea said. "It's great to get outside of your comfort zone. I'm always in the kitchen and on the line, so it's nice to get out in the public. And the title itself is kind of insane, so why not try to go for something like that?"
Chef Brandon Blethen of Robert's Maine Grill in Kittery said he wanted to keep his dish secret, but all of the recipes were posted Thursday at harvestonthehar bor.com.
According to the website, Blethen's dish will be Maine lobster fried in a light Allagash beer batter with smoked orange tomato and lobster reduction over Maine mashed potatoes, Swiss chard and micro-greens.
"We source things really super local, from farms that are less than a mile and a half away from the restaurant and from local fishermen that are close," Blethen said.
The event will be emceed by chef Michele Ragussis, a Food Network Star finalist who cooks seasonally at the Pearl Seafood Restaurant and Raw Bar in Rockland.
The festival will have some new events this year.
"International Maine: Taste the World" will focus on tastings and demonstrations of ethnic cuisine in Maine, including food and drink from restaurants such as El Camino Cantina, in Brunswick; and Tandoor, an Indian restaurant in Portland.
Wine lovers will be able to make their own wine in a wine-blending seminar with the vintners of Lyeth Winery in Sonoma County, Calif.
Fans of craft brews will be able to attend a tasting featuring Oxbow Brewery beers paired with oysters and cheese, Whitten said, and "learn about their unconventional approach to crafting contemporary American farmhouse ales which they tout as loud beers from a quiet place."
That event is almost sold out already.
The competitors for another returning event, Top of the Crop: Maine's Best Farm to Table Restaurant, also were announced Thursday.
The finalists will be chefs Chad Conley, of Gather, in Yarmouth; Kerry Altiero, of Café Miranda, in Rockland; Richard Hanson, of Cleonice Mediterranean Bistro, in Ellsworth; and David Levi, who will open a restaurant called Vinland in Portland in November.
Chef Sam Hayward, of Portland's Fore Street restaurant, a longtime advocate of farm-to-table fare, will be the emcee.
Chefs for the Top of the Crop and the Maine Lobster Chef of the Year competitions were chosen by a committee of four local chefs who reviewed competitors' biographical sketches, read about their farm-to-table philosophy and reviewed their submitted recipes.
Altiero, who won Maine Lobster Chef of the Year last year, said today's farm-to-table movement is actually just a return to Maine's culinary roots.
"My Italian grandmother would say, 'Kerry, this is nothing new. It's just the way it used to be,'" he said.

SKOWHEGAN -- It's not your regular fair offering. But there it is anyway, tucked between an Italian sausage vendor and a fried dough concession on the midway of the Skowhegan State Fair.
Johanna Franz is selling German schnitzel.
Schnitzel on a stick with grilled onions. Schnitzel tacos. Schnitzel burgers and German potato pancakes.
For Franz, 52, of Trescott, which is near Lubec in Washington County, this year was her first try at selling her schnitzel at the Skowhegan fair.
She said Monday the reception has been good so far.
"It's absolutely fantastic," Franz said, with a hint of a German accent in her voice. "The people who come to the fair really seem to take the step here to experiment with food. I am very impressed."
Schnitzel is pork loin that has been trimmed of fat and pounded flat with a kitchen meat hammer to tenderize it. Veal also can be used for the more familiar wiener schnitzel. The meat is marinated for a minimum of two days in her own concoction of red wine, garlic, onions, herbs and spices.
The meat is then coated in flour and beaten eggs, rubbed with spices and grilled for three to four minutes.
Also on the menu at her homemade food trailer she calls Sunny Waters Grille is a lobster burger and made-from-scratch, deep-fried cheesecake rolls with blueberry sauce. Both are her own creations. She also makes cold teas from blueberries, pomegranate and elder flowers from her own elder tree.
Chad Henderson and his mother, Janice, of Malborough, Conn., stopped by the schnitzel stand Monday, mainly out of curiosity.
"I didn't really know exactly what it was, but I wanted to try it," Chad Henderson said. "It sounded interesting and it sounds like it has a neat flavor and I like stuff from other countries. It's taking a couple minutes; that usually means it's going to be really good."
With his first taste of schnitzel on a stick, Chad Henderson said the taste of the meat and the spices was just what he expected.
"It's wonderful -- a lot of taste -- the first bite was really flavorful," he said. "I could taste the seasoning, whatever the rub is on it. That's really good. Very soft and tender."
Franz was born in Chicago to German-Yugoslavian parents. Her father left before she was a year old and she and her mother returned to Germany where Franz said she started cooking about age 10. She later attended a culinary school in Germany.
Franz came back to the United States in 1988, settled in Massachusetts where she learned to speak English. She and her husband and three sons moved to Maine in 1993, where she opened the Cutler General Store and Restaurant, which served German and American cuisine.
It was in coastal Cutler that she got the idea for her lobster burgers, Franz said. Local fishermen would bring in scallops for her to cook and one day she chopped up the mollusks with onions and spices and the scallop burger was born and became an immediate hit with the locals.
She adopted that recipe using lobster.
"There is at least 3 or 4 ounces of lobster in each burger, chopped up and held together with egg and a seafood stock -- I want to imitate the taste of baked stuffed lobster," she said.
Franz said she has set up shop at smaller festivals and fairs Down East, where she lives, and at the Bangor State Fair, also for the first time this year.
The jump to Skowhegan this year was a gamble.
"I'm glad I came to Skowhegan -- it's a beautiful fair -- the fairgrounds, rest rooms, everything is well maintained; clean, absolutely wonderful," she said. "I think by yesterday I already have made the rent money."

Leaders: Reducing carbon emission would aid lobsters

PORTLAND -- Drastically reducing carbon emissions would likely slow the effects of climate change and its negative impact on the Gulf of Maine lobster industry, leaders of the Maine environmental, scientific and business communities said Tuesday.
The negative effects, which include rising water temperature and increased acidification in the Gulf of Maine, and disease and life-cycle changes in lobsters and other shellfish, have raised concerns about the state's most lucrative fishery, environmental advocates said.
Officials the Natural Resources Council of Maine and marine scientist Rick Wahle, a University of Maine zoologist in the School of Marine Sciences, and representatives of the Maine Lobster Council, Ready Seafood Co. and the Maine Restaurant Association, launched a campaign Tuesday to raise awareness about the economic value of the state's lobster fishery and the challenges it faces.
"There is a problem. We are beginning to see the effects of climate change in the Gulf of Maine," said Emmie Theberge, clean-energy outreach coordinator for the resources council. "And the oceans are more sensitive to climate change."
So far, one of the biggest problems for the Maine lobster industry has been its own success. While lobster fisheries in southern New England are languishing, those in the Gulf of Maine are thriving as lobsters abandon warmer water as far south as Long Island Sound and move north, marine biologists have documented.
The surge in lobster numbers in the Gulf of Maine has led to an oversupply, which last year caused the per-pound price at the pier to dip as low as $2.50 in some areas. Partly in response to that, an aggressive new marketing campaign, funded by $2 million a year in state money, is attempting to open untapped global markets for Maine lobsters. Tuesday's news conference was part of that campaign.
But the lobster glut in the Gulf of Maine is no reason for complacence, marine biologists have warned.
Lobsters here have shown negative reaction to warming water temperatures and ocean acidification, particularly through early shedding in recent years and migrating north to colder water, said Wahle. Disease and parasites could become a problem, if climate changed is not slowed by reductions in carbon-dioxide emissions. In southern waters, lobsters have developed a disease that causes their shells to slowly disintegrate.
"I don't want to paint too rosy a picture," he said.
Because the problems facing the industry appear to be primarily related to climate change stemming from human activity, the group underscored the need for Mainers and legislative leaders to lobby for passage of President Barack Obama's carbon reduction plan. The plan, released last week, calls for drastic reductions in carbon emissions nationally. Carbon pollution from burning coal, oil and gas in power plants accounts for roughly 40 percent of all U.S. carbon emissions.
"Maine can't solve this problem alone," Theberge said.
The public information campaign was launched in anticipation of the Fourth of July holiday, and was designed to demonstrate how important the lobster is to Maine's identity, history, economy and seacoast communities. The lobster industry contributed $338 million to the state's economy in 2012 and employs 3,000 full-time and 2,500 part-time lobstermen.
The group held the news conference at Portland Lobster Co. restaurant on the Portland waterfront.
"We love and depend on lobsters," said Theberge. "Lobster is tied to Maine's very identity."

Portland restaurateur going gangbusters

Full text:   Portland Press Herald
PORTLAND -- Harding Lee Smith was on the phone in his black Chevy SUV, chatting with a chef he wanted to hire for one of his restaurants while he drove toward a copy shop on Fore Street.
The 44-year-old chef was talking to Dylan Boepple, "a kid from Vermont" who would be taking over for Brandon Tenney, chef de cuisine at The Grill Room & Bar. Tenney was being promoted to a new position -- executive sous-chef for all of Smith's popular "Rooms" restaurants.
In his baritone voice, Smith told Boepple that he expects a year's commitment: "That's what I expect from someone like you -- that you're not going to walk down the street for 50 cents more an hour, or something like that."
Smith, whose phone is constantly glued to his ear, drove around a while until he had finished the call and realized, a little sheepishly, that he was still blocks away from the copy shop.
This has been Smith's life the past few months, as he juggles managing his three Portland restaurants while trying to open a fourth: Boone's Fish House & Oyster Room, a new seafood place on Custom House Wharf.
In a year with an unusually large number of restaurant openings in the works in Portland, Boone's is one of the most anticipated. It's a project that will give Smith an unprecedented fourth restaurant within the city limits, and revitalize the late-19th-century waterfront building where it's said Alexander Boone first served baked stuffed lobster.
While other Portland chefs are developing third and fourth restaurants of their own, some of them may be in other locations or financed by outside investors. Smith's restaurants are all in Portland, and they have been successful enough that he says he did not need an infusion of outside cash for Boone's.
The new Boone's, whose target opening date is June 15, will provide jobs for 55 to 60 people, bringing the total number of employees working for Smith, at the height of summer, to 160 to 170. In a first for Smith, he's just hired Bryan Dame, formerly of the Tides Beach Club in Kennebunkport and The Edge in Lincolnville, to be executive chef at the new establishment.
"It's the first time I've hired an executive chef, so this is a big step for me," Smith said. "I'm not turning it over to him. Obviously, we'll be working very closely together, but I'll be the expediter overseeing it, and he'll be nose-to-the-grindstone. He's a tremendous, dynamic personality, an absolute workaholic, and very talented foodwise, too."
With four restaurants to run, Smith will need the help. He opened The Front Room Restaurant & Bar on Congress Street in 2005. The Grill Room & Bar and The Corner Room Italian Kitchen & Bar, both on Exchange Street, followed in 2008 and 2009.
Kate Krader, restaurant editor at Food & Wine magazine, said there's a national trend of chefs creating "their own little mini empires."
"It's probably sort of a backlash against some of the chaining of talented chefs," she said, "and they have different interests and different itches they want to scratch."
In Smith's case, he is as much restaurateur as chef. It is a path that he has consciously chosen. He still enjoys being in the kitchen and cares about the food he serves, but he is focused just as much on the decor, the ambience and the bottom line as what goes on the plate.
"I'm not just a cook," he says. "I love to cook, and I'm a good chef, I think, but I hire good people and I let them sort of do what they do. I put them in place and let them run with it. What I'm really good at is doing the food demonstrations and talking with people at the dining bar and explaining what the food's about.
"I don't ever try to say I'm the best chef around. There are tremendous chefs doing all kinds of crazy, intense stuff that we don't necessarily do. We're good at the service part, and putting on the show and making the room look nice."
To Smith, his establishments aren't just restaurants. They're theaters.
And when customers start to arrive, it's showtime.
The concept of restaurant-as-theater is so ingrained that even his employees and customers pick up on it.
Morgan Fineberg, who has worked for about a year as a server and bartender at The Corner Room, where Smith holds court behind the antipasti bar on Friday and Saturday nights, says he likes it when Smith is in the house because it makes him step up his own game.
"It's almost like a play, a show," Fineberg said. "You prepare throughout the week and then ... he's finally there, it's Friday or Saturday night and you're booked for the whole night, and it all culminates into that one night of ready? Go."
At the copy shop, Smith picked up blueprints for the hood system at Boone's, then drove to City Hall, a place he knows well by now.
He was wearing his signature black chef's garb and a navy jacket, sunglasses secured around his neck. While tattoos are de rigueur among younger restaurant workers, Smith has never succumbed to the temptation. Instead, he wears tiny loop earrings in each ear, gifts from his father and uncle.
Venting about City Hall is a frequent pastime.
When Smith reached the window at the Building Inspections Office, he discovered that the paper blueprints he just paid for at the copy shop were unnecessary. The clerk informed him that all plans must now be submitted electronically, a change implemented just three days before.
Smith headed back downstairs, calling and texting his people on the phone, trying to figure out what to do next.
"So after you open three restaurants," he said, "you'd think it would be easy to open a fourth one, right?"
As frustrating as Smith finds the paperwork, being a restaurateur is in his blood.
One of his earliest memories is of standing at the stove at age 4, watching his father make crepes. It was the 1970s, and his parents loved giving dinner parties.
"You know when you flip it like that? If it didn't land back in the pan and hit the stove, I could eat it," Smith recalled.
His early years were spent on Shoal Cove in West Bath, right on the water. He grew up sailing and lobstering in the area. The family didn't have a lot of money, but Smith's father would spend money on good food. Barry Smith read cookbooks by James Beard and Julia Child and often tried making elaborate dishes like Baked Alaska.
Smith's father soon became a full-time partner of Barbara Dean's in Ogunquit, a classic coastal Maine restaurant that was open for breakfast and dinner. At age 7, Smith sat on a stool at Barbara Dean's waiting for someone to order a lobster, and when they did, it was his job to cook it.
"We did 400 breakfasts at a whack," Smith said. "Dinners, it was a broiled haddock, scallops, prime rib kind of place. It wasn't fancy, but I did learn a lot."
After his parents divorced, Smith moved to Ogunquit to live with his father while he attended Wells Junior High. During the summers, he'd work at Barbara Dean's, restocking the salad bar and doing prep work.
For high school, he moved back to Portland to live with his mother and stepfather, Ernie Stallworth, who at the time was a Portland Press Herald sportswriter covering the New England Patriots. He worked in local restaurants and cooked at home a lot -- eggplant parmigiana was his specialty -- to help out.
When it came time to decide on college, Smith told his guidance counselor he wanted to be either a doctor or a journalist. The counselor knew his family had owned a restaurant, so he steered him toward the hospitality industry, explaining that becoming a doctor involved many years of schooling.
"He summed up my academic achievement thus far in my letter of recommendation as 'the conservation of energy,'" Smith said. "'He applies himself when needed, but it takes some time.' He actually wrote that."
Smith finally found his calling in Boston, working in restaurants while he studied hotel management at Boston University. He landed his first big-city restaurant job at Joe's American Bar and Grill.
"I grew up in restaurants," Smith said. "I thought I knew what I was doing, and (I had) no clue. No clue. Could barely hold a knife, it turned out. So they put me on the pantry, making salads during the day. Then one night the saute cook called in sick, so they said, 'OK, we're going to put you on saute tonight.' No training, nothing. Just threw me on, and I did well.
"The next night, they put me on the grill. And then, like two months later, I was a sous chef. I was good at it. Then I realized, 'This is what I'm going to do. I want to be a chef.'"
During these early years, Smith set a goal of opening five or six restaurants by the time he was 30. He vowed that if he failed, he would find something else to do.
After leaving Boston, Smith spent a few years working in restaurants in California, Italy and Hawaii. He took classes at the West Coast campus of the Culinary Institute of America. He married and divorced.
By the time Smith was in his mid-30s, not only did he not have a restaurant of his own, he was fired as the chef of Mims Brasserie in Portland after what he describes as a power struggle with the owner.
He moped around for a couple of days afterward, depressed. But getting fired would turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to him.
Seven months later, he had a lease for The Front Room.
The Front Room space was in Smith's own Munjoy Hill neighborhood -- he'd originally spied it while walking his dogs. He wrote a business plan, got the zoning changed, and found five investors willing to pony up $25,000 each.
He remembers being so filled with worry the night before the restaurant opened that he was unable to sleep. What if it's not busy?
Turned out that would be no problem.
"It was gangbusters, and it's been gangbusters ever since," he said. "We got really lucky with that spot."
Smith and his wife, Darcy, live above The Front Room in a modest apartment that they share with their three cats and two Labrador retrievers. Married for almost four years, they are preparing for the arrival of their first child, a boy expected in September.
Age and approaching fatherhood have mellowed the chef, Darcy Smith said. She admits that even she was initially intimidated by his hothead reputation and was nervous about meeting him for the first time when she went to try to sell him a new computer system.
Darcy helps manage the restaurants, although she is doing less of that now that she's nesting. At home, the couple's life revolves around work, food, the Red Sox and sailing the boat he moors on the Portland waterfront.
The most outward sign that a chef lives in the apartment is in the living room, where an entire wall has been transformed into a bookcase for an extensive collection of cookbooks -- everything from Escoffier to Alice Waters.
Yet the Smiths do not cook much here, except for maybe his roast chicken or her chili on a night the New England Patriots are playing. They prefer eating out. Smith is partial to Miyake's sushi and anything from Veranda Noodle Bar. For brunch, it's Petite Jacqueline or Caiola's. When in Boston, they never miss a visit to the Neptune oyster bar in the North End.
"Really, most of our life revolves around eating," Darcy said, laughing.
From the Smiths' apartment, you can hear chairs lightly scraping the floor in The Front Room below. Smith occasionally starts his day with breakfast downstairs, but has found he has trouble relaxing because he's always on the lookout for problems to fix. And he never goes in for brunch on Saturdays or Sundays. "I feel guilty taking up a chair," he said.
Smith believes his menus earn people's trust. Make a good meatloaf or simple chicken dish, and maybe your customers will be willing to try some quail or skate wing on another day. If duck confit is on the menu, he calls it something else so guests won't be intimidated.
The topic of trust comes up a lot in conversations with, and about, Harding Lee Smith. His desire to have things just so has made it easier to butt heads with employees. There have always been rumors around town that he has a volcanic temper, but it's hard to find anyone who will talk about it publicly.
In 2010, a half dozen workers from The Front Room who had alleged wage and hour violations -- and claimed they had been subjected to abusive treatment by Smith -- filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Portland that was eventually settled.
Smith saw the lawsuit as a publicity stunt and/or "cash grab" by a restaurant workers' union and says he settled the case on the advice of his attorney -- not because he thought he would lose, but because it would cost too much to fight it.
Smith admits there have been times when he has "definitely lost it, without a doubt. But I think every chef who's worth his salt probably has."
In 2011, someone with a grudge set up fake Facebook and Twitter accounts in Smith's name. They insulted other local chefs and restaurants, made fun of celebrity chefs, and posted nasty comments about Smith's personal life.
"I'm sure certain people have certain thoughts about me, and I have a reputation with some people of being a jerk and being an (expletive) or whatever," he said. "If you do your job, you never hear a word from me, you know? If you don't do your job, you're probably not going to work here much longer."
Darcy Smith says her husband is "not mean to people," but he has "thrown many a pan" to get his employees' attention. One new employee was so intimidated by Smith's reputation that he asked for every Thursday off -- because that was the day Smith came in to that restaurant.
Jesse Poirier, the new chef at The Porthole, worked for Smith at The Front Room, and describes him as extremely demanding but fiercely loyal to employees who work hard and show loyalty to him.
"He probably expects more out of his employees than any other chef I've ever worked for," Poirier said. "It's a good thing, because it teaches you to go on and do things on your own."
Smith said it can be a challenge to find people who are a good fit for his businesses. He sings the praises of Greg Wilson, the chef de cuisine at The Front Room and now The Corner Room, who worked at the tony White Barn Inn in Kennebunk before coming to Portland to cook homestyle comfort food.
But it took a long time for Wilson to gain Smith's trust. Smith still remembers the day his new chef kicked him out of his own kitchen, sending his boss upstairs to his apartment to watch TV.
"Those first couple of nights," Smith said, "it was, 'What's going on down there?' I've let that go now."
Smith's attention to detail and the trust he puts in his employees pay off with customers.
Dan Crewe of Cumberland has a standing breakfast date with two friends every Sunday at The Front Room, and he stops by often for lunch or dinner. He likes that he can recommend a dish to friends and know that when they order it, it will be as good as the day he tried it.
"You know, so often when you go to a restaurant and you're impressed with something, it's very seldom that it's always consistent," Crewe said. "It's a very small facility, and they just seem to do a marvelous job of keeping it reasonably high quality, and I'm very impressed with that."
It's a sign of the Rooms' popularity that when Smith offered Living Social coupons for The Corner Room a couple of years ago, he sold 2,700 of them, which at the time was a record for New England. When he offered coupons for The Front Room in January, he sold 4,400 -- the most ever sold by a U.S. restaurant.
After leaving City Hall, Smith drove down to Boone's, which was almost completely gutted and crawling with workers, for meetings with equipment dealers and vendors.
He had to make significant improvements to meet code, installing steel beams to reinforce the second floor and adding a new sprinkler system.
"This was all spray-painted with baby-blue paint," Smith said, describing how he found the first floor when he leased the space. "The floor was just nasty carpet and so forth. Over the last three months, we've taken everything out, put down a brand-new floor, stripped all these beams down individually one by one -- an hour and a half per beam -- and then sanded them and varnished them."
A mezzanine area in the back gives the space that theatrical feel. Smith calls the main seating area "the pit." All together, the downstairs will seat 150.
In the front of the room will be "the stage," a display kitchen flanked by a lobster tank, a bar and a fireplace. A prep kitchen with refrigeration, storage and a larger lobster tank will be behind the display kitchen, out of sight.
The upstairs, which will have a wood-fired oven, will be used mostly as a private dining and function space that can serve about 85 people. This is also where the "Oyster Room" will be.
"We're not building it to be here for two weeks, or two years or even five years. It's here to be here for 20 years. I hope it will live beyond me, you know what I mean? Now that I have a child coming, maybe the child will be running it."
He crossed his fingers and looked skyward.
"Please?"
Smith joked that it was now time to head back to his "real job" at The Corner Room.
He met with state and local health inspectors, then walked down Exchange Street to spend some time at The Grill Room, where alcohol sales reps were lying in wait for his arrival.
By 4 p.m. the dining room at The Corner Room was starting to buzz. Candles were lit, giving the room a soft glow. The ceiling fans, classic crown molding and Tuscan red walls added to the warm atmosphere. A bartender raced by, balancing several clinking wine glasses in both hands.
The staff knew the night would be busy because there was a ballet performance at nearby Merrill Auditorium. Smith describes the Merrill crowd as being like a wave of locusts, swooping in to dine between 5:45 and 7:15 p.m. before flying off to catch the performance.
"It will get pretty nutty in here," he said.
Smith took his place behind the antipasti bar. He likes the fact that, from here, he can see both the dining room and the kitchen, and talk to customers who sit at the curved bar.
On the bar was a stack of white plates, a basket of tomatoes, a bowl of eggs, a block of cheese on a cheeseboard, a Berkel meat slicer and bottles of extra virgin olive oil, orange olive oil, white truffle oil and vincotto negroamaro. Old cutting boards and butcher knives hung from a wrought iron rack overhead.
Smith grabbed a large cup of ice and soda to sip on during service and started mixing salads and writing the specials.
The specials included a hake dish, a Smith favorite. ("It's really meaty but still flaky inside.") The hake would be served with a cauliflower puree and a watercress and cara cara orange salad. ("Cara cara oranges right now are really beautiful. They're honey-like.")
Sometimes, Smith said, a special won't sell because the description isn't worded correctly. When the chef added octopus sopressata to the menu, the dish initially didn't go over well with customers."They think, 'Octopus salami. Oooh, gross,' " Smith said. "I changed it to octopus carpaccio?" He made a whistling noise. "Flying out the door."
At 4:45 p.m., it was time for the staff meeting. The servers crowded in front of Smith at the antipasti bar.
"OK, the first page of your menu," Smith began. "The salumi list, that's where you start. We've talked about it many times. When you talk about the salumis and the cheeses, we sell them, and if you don't, we don't."
Smith told them about the pork loin cured with blood orange and fennel and about the arctic char tartare, coarsely chopped and tossed simply with lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, a little red onion and caper, served with a grapefruit and arugula salad. The servers took notes with the intensity of White House reporters at a presidential news conference.
Eventually, he came to the octopus.
"It's a carpaccio in name only, it's not a true carpaccio," Smith said. "It's cooked. The octopus is braised for six hours and then pressed through a terrine so it has a marbleized look to it."
Soon, customers started arriving, and so did Smith's first order.
"When you talk about the salumi and cheese, you sell the salumi and cheese," Smith happily pronounced. "Boom, first ticket."
A few minutes later, he put up another plate of salumi. "See? Talk about the salumi, sell the salumi."
Smith loves salumi, and he may soon be ramping up his own production of the Italian meats. His brother-in-law and his wife live on a small farm in Windham where they'll be raising heritage breed pigs this year for Smith's restaurants.
Smith plans to renovate the barn into a commercial space with a dry aging room for beef for The Grill Room and a salumeria where he can cure his own salamis and meats, age them properly, and sell them.
He's already dreaming of his next big thing -- a retail storefront that includes an Italian deli.
"I always have a project on the horizon," he said. "I get bored very easily."

Maine clammers' new nightmare: Green crabs

FREEPORT -- They lurk underfoot and in the shallows, waiting for the tide to take them to their prey.
In the thatch grass, dozens can be heard skittering and chittering in their nests. In droves they have come and are conquering the clam flats, ready to devour soft-shell clams and take a bite out of the livelihood for many in this town.
They are green crabs -- a hungry, multiplying army of them -- and although hardly new to Maine's muddy coast, a confluence of mild winter temperatures and steadily warming ocean waters that are a product of climate change could mean an impending crisis for clammers and their multimillion-dollar fishery.
"They're consuming everything in the environment, even plants," said Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association, whose group is preparing an all-out offensive against the species. "We may be facing the end of the commercially viable soft-shell (clam) population," he said. "I think it is dire."
While scientists have by no means forgotten the crab, academic funding to examine its effects or to monitor the species' population is practically nonexistent, said Brian Beal, a University of Maine marine ecologist who specializes in shellfish. But clammers who have raked the mud flats for years say the crabs are quickly chewing through the clam beds, devouring the tiny, millimeters-wide baby clams known as "spat" that form the foundation of future years' landings.
Now for the first time on a meaningful scale, the town of Freeport will fund a study to determine if trapping, fencing and netting techniques are effective means to stem the waves of the 10-legged invaders. Three coves along the Harraseeket River will host multiple experiments that will be overseen by Beal and an independent consultant, who will track the movement, numbers and effects on clams of the crabs in the study area.
So what is the current impact of the crabs on the $25 million industry, the third-largest fishery in the state with more than 1,700 registered clam-diggers in Maine?
"That's a great question, and it doesn't really have a good answer because no one is tracking this stuff," Beal said.
The Freeport study, while small in scale relative to research efforts in other fisheries, represents a willingness by the town to acknowledge the prospect of a clamming-fishery collapse if trends continue as they are.
"For the first time, let's do trapping and let's do fencing and let's do netting and combine all this stuff together," he said.
The project will employ volunteer clammers who have agreed to fish 80 green-crab traps in the Harraseeket until November. After Beal receives permits in the coming weeks from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to move forward, he plans to install hundreds of feet of plastic fencing that will be dug into the mud across the mouth of the coves, a deterrent to the non-swimming green crab, which in theory cannot crawl through the barrier.
Inside, Beal plans to stake off 50-foot by 50-foot experiment areas to determine how effectively the fencing prevents crabs from entering and to gauge the effectiveness of the various deterrents.
The town has committed about $65,000 this year to fund the work, and will likely consider continuing the study next season, said Beal.
The environmental factors that are believed to underlie the crab population explosion mimic a micro-trend observed in the 1950s, believed to have been driven by mild weather, when the crabs were seen closer to the shore and in sandy nests, rather than remaining in the intertidal areas they usually call home.
Coffin said his group, the Maine Clammer's Association, is ramping up its focus on education for clammers and other fishermen about the crab's threat to the coastal ecosystems.
Some fishermen in Maine are in denial about the problem, he said.
"We're fighting the fishermen who we're trying to save," said Coffin. "A lot of fishermen don't realize the impact these (crabs) have had. They say, 'They're not eating our clams.' Well, what is?"
Coffin and his cohorts say they will soon be reinvigorating the clammers association, which was founded in 2008, largely to pressure local shellfish authorities to open clam flats that had been closed for years. And like other fishermen in Maine who value their independent lifestyles, the formation of industry groups is often focused around a crisis.
This year the association lost its tax-exempt status after failing to file paperwork with the IRS for three consecutive years, said Nora Healy, a partner at Portland law firm Verrill Dana, and a member of the Freeport Shellfish Commission. She said a request is under way to reapply for nonprofit status.
Coffin said the loss of the tax exempt status will not hamper his efforts to spread the word about the crab problem.
Denis-Marc Nault, a municipal shellfish management supervisor, said the state Department of Marine Resources has limited ability to manage the predation, but the agency has worked to grant trapping permits for the crabs to a half-dozen coastal towns, up from one or two permits in years past.
"It's never been a concerted long hard effort," said Nault. "We have no money in our budget, and that's not really our job to do a predator control program."
Nault said the crabs are one among many factors that influence shellfish population. Milky ribbon worms, moon snails, and shellfish blood disease also contribute to the reduced productivity of clamming flats, he said.
According to scientists who study the Gulf of Maine, climate change is at the root of many of the issues felt along the coast.
In the last 115 years, four of the eight wettest years have been recorded since 2005, which pushes more fresh water into the Gulf of Maine, said William Balch, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay.
The runoff reduces salinity and introduces solid materials that block sunlight, reducing the stock of the tiny phytoplankton that provide the basic nutrients for virtually all sea life.
"If you shut off the bottom of the marine food web for four years straight, that will undoubtedly have an impact," Balch said.
Combined with the steady rise in ocean temperature associated with climate change, which from 1977 to 2010 has pushed up surface temperatures about .018 degree celsius a year, the impact has been vast on the closely linked ecosystems in the gulf.
The rise in ocean temperature in particular has helped foster the green crabs, which thrive in the warmer temperatures that more closely mirror conditions in their native Europe.
The scientific explanations, however, do not change the reality for clammers, who may soon be seeing a reduction in landings if crabs continue to destroy next year's clam stock. For some clammers, the brightest future may include a perpetual fight against the shifting forces of nature spurred by the changing climate.
To Coffin, who said he will continue to clam and educate others about how to keep the shellfish population healthy, the task is clear.
"We have a lot more crabs to kill," he said.

Full text:   Maine Sunday Telegram
In the soft, lightening dawn, I make my peace with the day.
Now that the light comes earlier and stays later, my animal metabolism has shifted out of the sloth of hibernation to a sort of energized, eager joy. Without thought, I awaken before the sun has come up fully over the horizon, in advance of a definite sky of unbroken blue or misty gray. The rains, when they hover, fall on and off, like whispers of gossip going 'round, subsiding and then storming back, wearing themselves out.
Every morning now, the sun and songbirds are the clock by which I calculate the start of day. A hawk -- a northern harrier -- has returned to "our" woods and is settling all scores on the matter of territory. I hear him at any moment when trouble is on the way, and occasionally I see him mobbed by crows, cooperating to defend their borders.
One gift of living in the woods has been exposure to the proliferation of unknown, unidentified bird song. I find myself undone by the symphony of it, and try listening to a CD of bird vocalizations to help me recognize the instruments.
But it may be that I am no longer able to learn or memorize these auditory nuances from the higher realms. My human heart, my earthbound hearing, has left me at last straining to make the sounds of the natural world sensible -- as they were to me when I was a child and life uncomplicated by constant chatter and pings from some technology perched in my palm.
Still, I give myself chance after chance to learn from the recording the happy chirps, insistent whistles, liquid trills and sharp caws -- memory etched into a plate of plastic -- as I navigate to Portland in the morning and then in the evening return north, home again, reversing my course like a tide, trying to stay in tune with natural things.
But at the opening of the day, while I am still moored on the shore of sleep, when the twilight is slipping away and the promise of the morning is still only a murmur beyond the window, I let myself waken slowly, like a dog or a doe, knowing no human hurry, no fret about finances or worry over work. These moments make for the sweetest eclipse, a transport out of time into the drift of earthly eternity.
The cold of the night still clings to the landscape and threads its way through the window screens, a chill and breeze that coaxes me to stay where I am, ensconced in flannel, cotton and down. I burrow in for a few more minutes before I join the living, laboring world in which I must sustain myself like any other creature with the instinct to survive. But finally the whirring of my thoughts, spinning the design of the day, alert me to all the devotion I must meet, and I am up.
So much about my life has simplified to the lowest common denominator: seeking peace, and staying there. I do little that would interest or excite anyone other than the dog who attends me through my obligate hours, mostly waiting -- for walks or treats or unplanned ride-alongs in the car.
Our rituals are a happy tedium of repetitions: I rise five or 10 minutes before she stirs, start water boiling for coffee, produce all the sounds of 25-pound bags of kibble being opened and cups of pebbles being poured into a large, thick plastic bowl. I refill the bottomless pit of her water trough and set aside a single biscuit on a throw rug nearby.
Then, on a much smaller scale, I repeat the same movements for myself with a bag of Swedish coffee and a cone drip pot. By the time the water is churning to a boil, I hear the dog's nails clicking carefully down the wooden stairs, the immediate tick-tock in the clock of the day.
I could go on like this forever, and sometimes do, stretching the hard-won indolence of a Saturday morning or Sunday afternoon into a pursuit of high importance: doing nothing special, a saving grace. Rest.
I'm no longer trying to be something or become somebody in any other world than this precious one that I have made my own -- an acre of harmony, a home amid the trees. It takes so little to have too much -- the burden of acquisitions weighing us down. It is enough to navigate along preserved forest paths or rocky coastlines we do not own but are offered, as stewards, to hold; to reacquaint ourselves with the lost satisfactions of just being outdoors and discovering a downed limb that serves as an ideal walking stick. It is all wealth to be had to be able to pluck a scallop or oyster shell and marveling at the intricacy of its manufacture and the complexity of its color.
I am working my way toward nothingness, paring down to essentials, and perhaps past that grasping level, too. I am molting, shedding all I do not need in favor of something lighter and true. I am growing new feathers, a more suitable shell. All I want now is the chance to fly with the song of morning or move deeper into the deeply shadowed sea of my soul. Soaring or reaching the foundation of things -- it's all the same, my last task, my first love.

More Italian delicacies likely after ban eased

Salami, culatello, pancetta, coppa.
Businesses that traffic in Italian cured pork products are excited about the possibility of importing more of these "delizioso" meats from regions of northern Italy that have been off-limits to American palates for decades.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced it would relax a ban on the importation of Italian cold cuts and other pork products beginning May 28, a move that will allow products from four regions and two provinces in northern Italy to be imported to the United States.
"It's almost like it's coming full circle," said Bruce Micucci, president of Micucci Wholesale Foods in Portland, which services more than 200 restaurants in Maine, New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts.
"You know, dry-cured meats -- whether it be capicolas and sopressata salamis, all dry-cured prosciuttos -- were very popular 30 years ago," Micucci said. "It's not so much new meats as accepting the old ways of doing things. ... We've lost so much flavor and taste."
The USDA edict covers the Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont regions, and the provinces of Trento and Bolzano. Meats from these areas had been banned from this country because of the threat of swine vesicular disease, a communicable disease in swine.
Arlin Smith, general manager of Hugo's restaurant and Eventide Oyster Co. in Portland, said once products from these regions of Italy become available, "I guarantee you we would be buying as much of that stuff as possible. It's beautiful stuff. They are the masters. They are the ones who have been doing it for years."
Carrie Davenport, general manager of The Rogers Collection, a Portland-based importer of Mediterranean foods, predicted that a lot more authentic Italian charcuterie will become available in U.S. markets, and that over time, more regions of Italy could be opened as well.
Portland consumers who today buy Italian-style meats at Micucci's, the Italian grocery on India Street, may well be buying products made in Canada. Davenport said Italian producers have set up factories in Canada and export meats from there to the United States, "but it's not the authentic product from Italy."
"It's done with the same recipes," she said, "but it's basically an imitation product, so to speak."
Meat-processing plants in Italy must meet USDA standards, and initially there probably will be only a small number of plants within the regions that will be able to meet those standards, Davenport said. But as time goes on, more plants will be approved, and more products should become available.
Culatello, a refined cut of prosciutto that is cured and soaked in wine, will be one new import that will be coveted by chefs, Davenport said. Lardo, or cured fatback, will be "huge."
"There are lots of salamis and sausages and different cuts that you never see in America," Smith said. "Some of them are (made with) spontaneous fermentation. Basically, the same exact sausage in five different areas of Italy, every single one of them is going to taste different."
Lee Skawinski, chef and owner of Vignola Cinque Terre in Portland, has visited Italy many times to search for new products that he can bring back for his restaurant's menu.
He said both terroir and tradition make Italian salumi so full of flavor and prized by chefs and food lovers. "Terroir" refers to the natural environment in which the product was made. Where was the animal raised, and how? What did it eat?
"There's nothing like boar salumi from Tuscany, you know?" he said. "You just can't replicate that. Those flavors and those aromas just don't happen anyplace else in the world. It's because of the breeds of pigs and what they're eating."
There's so much regional variety in husbandry and production techniques in Italy, Skawinski said, that a Slow Food book that records all the different kinds of salumi is 400 pages long.
"People who are making salumi over there, a lot of them are families that have been doing this for 50, 60, 70, 100 years," he said. "I know that the guys we buy prosciutto from have about a 30 percent turnback rate on the legs of pork that they buy.
"So they accept only seven out of 10, at best. There's a very, very strict quality level with a lot of the good producers that they live or die buy."
The opening of the markets couldn't come at a better time. Americans' tastes are changing, and they are becoming more adventurous eaters willing to try a greater variety of foods.
Micucci notes that eight to 10 years ago, few stores carried -- and few cooks used -- pancetta in Maine. Now it's everywhere.
Micucci's brother Rick, who owns the Micucci grocery, has noticed a preference among his customers for the authentic Italian prosciutto that already is sold there over domestic varieties.
"It's different, and it's just a terrific product," he said. "We sell more of that than the domestic, even though it is about twice the price. We don't even sell the domestic mortadella anymore. We only sell mortadella from Italy because it was that much different.
"We do produce some pretty good salamis in this country," Rick Micucci added, "but I would love to see some from Italy."
Davenport said consumers are demanding better, more authentic products partly because of their exposure to them in their travels, through the media and popular culture.
She points to the huge popularity of Eataly, a bustling collection of Italian markets and restaurants in New York City, with a second U.S. location opening in Chicago this year.
"I feel like the world is becoming a smaller place," Davenport said. "People have traveled or watched cooking channels where people are traveling, and they're more curious and more willing to try products from other cultures."

BELGRADE -- On Thursday afternoon, a $20,000 buoy was deployed into the waters of Great Pond, a move environmental scientists say will help to answer questions about algal blooms and other looming threats to the lake's ecosystem.
Those who see the bright yellow buoy on the surface of the lake near Hoyt's Island might not realize that it could offer an early warning of blooms in the Belgrade Lakes and other waterways throughout Maine.
"We're seeing that they could be coming here more rapidly," Denise Bruesewitz, professor of environmental studies at Colby College, said of the blooms. "That's part of why Great Pond was chosen. It's in this state where they're not very prevalent, but where that could change."
The high-tech buoy will use a variety of solar-powered sensors to collect a rich data stream and wirelessly transmit it to a global network of scientists who will gain a better understanding of the complex natural processes that occur in the lake.
Among other things, scientists hope that regular readings on temperature, oxygen levels, light levels and phytoplankton activity will help combat the blooms, which have the potential to undermine seriously the region's tourist destination value.
Blooms happen when lake conditions allow for a population explosion of algae, which can clot the surface of the water with slimy green sheets of organic matter.
When the algae die and sink to the bottom of the lake, their decomposition takes so much oxygen out of the water that entire populations of fish can suffocate.
Algal blooms have been documented in the seven bodies of water that make up the Belgrade Lakes system since the 1990s, but so far, they have been relatively mild.
In East Pond, another lake in the system, East Pond Association President Rob Jones said blooms there have been of short duration and not severe enough to kill fish.
Still, he said, they are "at times, aesthetically unpleasant," and they have been a focus of mitigation efforts by the association for years.
Five algal blooms were recorded by the Department of Environmental Protection in Maine in 2012. One was in nearby China Lake, which the department said blooms every year. The other 2012 blooms were found in lakes in Eastbrook, Franklin, Jefferson and Rangeley.
On Great Pond, the mild algal blooms have not risen to the standard.
"Not even close," Whitney King, a Colby chemistry professor who has helped lead the effort said about blooms on Great Pond. "There's been nothing that the DEP would call a bloom."
A total of 54 lakes in Maine "frequently support algal blooms," according to the department.
Changes in climate can increase the occurrence, severity and impact of harmful algal blooms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which in 2004 was officially tasked by the federal government to research the blooms.
As the global climate shifts, blooms appear to be increasing -- not only in Maine, but in surface waters across the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Large blooms also have a large price tag.
In 2005, a form of algal bloom commonly referred to as red tide cost Maine and Massachusetts $23 million in shellfish sales, one of many coastal blooms that cost the United States at least $82 million each year, according to the oceanic administration.
It is hard to predict exactly how much money Maine might lose in the face of recurring algal blooms in lakes. A survey conducted by the World Health Organization found that one-third of tourists to coastal destinations would cancel their plans if they knew of an algal bloom in the area. In Kansas, a rash of severe blooms in 2011 caused a revenue drop of about 50 percent at Cheney State Park and turned some previously popular lakeside communities into ghost towns, according to local news reports.
The value of the Belgrade Lakes watershed is the subject of another ongoing study by Colby College. Once that study is completed, it may be possible to predict the costs of the blooms, which could help to leverage money to help prevent them.
The East Pond Association has been working to convince property owners in the watershed to take measures to prevent phosphorus from leaching into the lakes, because phosphorus can feed and stimulate the growth of algae.
On Great Pond in Belgrade on Thursday, the buoy deployment itself went fairly smoothly -- two boats full of Colby students and project leaders took the bright yellow buoy, affectionately known as "Goldie the Great Pond Sentinel" out to an agreed-upon point and went about arranging it with its anchors.
Fifteen minutes later, the buoy was fully operational. The only casualties were a cut a student suffered on his hand while wrestling the heavy buoy and anchors overboard, and a single screwdriver that inadvertently was dropped into the deepest depths of the pond, estimated at 65 feet.
Even before the sensors were dropped into the water, they were transmitting information back to a computer in the Maine Lakes Resource Center. Every fifteen minutes, a new set of data is transmitted, allowing for a detailed tracking of what is happening beneath the lake's surface.
Great Pond is one of about 50 lakes worldwide with such sensor-laden buoys on them. The lakes collectively give scientists in the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network information that can help to answer questions about global and regional trends.
On the local level, Bruesewitz, King and their colleagues can compare data to any observed algal blooms, which will allow for a better prediction and, ultimately, prevention.
If scientists understood exactly what conditions created the threshold for a harmful bloom, they could direct resources more effectively to prevent those conditions from happening.

OAKLAND -- Twelve Colby College students were summoned on charges including violating Maine's liquor laws shortly after midnight Friday night by officers from the Oakland Police Department.
Two of the students were found walking down Town Farm Road by officers on patrol, sparking a brief investigation that led to a nearby home rented by five students, Capt. Rick Stubbert said.
The five students charged with allowing minors to possess or consume liquor are: Jessalyn Steinam, 21, of Payson Street, Portland; Molly Hudson, 21, of Litchfield Road, Port Washington, N.Y.; Nora Elizabeth Barnard, 21, of Pope Street, Menlo Park, Calif.; Melanie Ross, 22, of Murch Road, Freeport; and Sarah Braselton, 21, address not given.
Six students were cited and charged with being a minor possessing liquor. They are: William Vietze, 20, of Bolden Road, Medfield, Mass.; Alison Smith, 20, of Christy Hill Road, Gales Ferry, Conn.; Eric Nesto, 19, of Mayflower Hill Drive, Waterville; Christopher Smith, 19, of Oyster Bay Road, Locust Valley, N.Y.; Brian Palmer, 20, of Oakwood Overlook, Dayton, Mass.; and Emily Malinowski, 18, of 32nd Place, Washington, D.C.
John Vanasse, 21, of Briar Lane, Westwood, Mass., was charged with hindering apprehension or prosecution.
Stubbert said the students were taken back to campus through a coordinated effort of the Oakland police and Colby's security officers,
In March, 81 Colby students were among 90 young people charged with possession of alcohol by a minor, at a house on Washington Street in Waterville.

Surf's up for clams

Full text:   Maine's turbulent waters attract multitudes of clams -- and clamdiggers.
I enjoy winter and all the activities it offers, but after a while it's nice to change pace and head out into the ocean surf in February or March and search for sea clams.
When the tide, time and temperatures are just right, you can get a mess of clams just under the surf in a little more than a couple hours.
Sea clams, more popularly known as hen or surf clams in Maine, are the largest clams in the New England region. These fast-growing bivalves can reach sizes in excess of eight inches across, and grow to about five inches in just three years.
Clams love the sandy, cool, turbulent water that is found in a highly active surf environment. Appropriately nicknamed as surf clams, they reside where those big rolling waves are breaking, feasting on the food that rolls over them with each passing wave.
"We are at their northern extreme for habitat and temperature," said Denis Nault, who oversees the shellfish management division at the Maine Department of Marine Resources. "These clams are found offshore of New Jersey all the way up to where we are. There are even a few places you can find them around Ellsworth."
Since they love the rolling surf, the best time to dig for these clams are during those low, low lunar tides that happen about once a month.
"When that tide is out the farthest, that's when you can get out to that area and not get roughed up by the surf," said Nault.
This time of year, the preferred method to dig these clams are a pair of hip boots or chest waders. You poke along the soft sand with a pitchfork, probing along the surf until you hear a clink of metal on shell. Stick your pitchfork under it, and you can pop it right out.
Unlike their long-necked cousins, surf clams have relatively short necks, so they reside just under the sandy surface.
"They don't get down that deep at all into the bottom, which is unusual, because this clam has such a big foot. They pull their neck in and out in an active surf environment," said Nault. A trained eye can often spot a small bulge in the sand as a likely spot to dig.
While I like to use a pitchfork, others like the rounded tines of a manure fork, or even a potato rake or quahog scratcher.
In warmer months, those with a sixth sense will just use their eyes and feet, perhaps coupled with a wet suit, feeling for the bulge in the sand with their feet, or scanning for a small deviation in the sand.
Probably the most popular area to find surf clams is the northern Old Orchard Beach area north to Prouts Neck in Scarborough. The long sandy beaches coupled with the pounding surf is ideal habitat for sea clams.
If you are wondering just where you should go, do a little scouting after a big storm.
"The way I always harvested surf clams on the Cape was to go out to the outer beach after a storm, and you would just pick them up," said Nault, who adds that if you find one, more than likely there will be a lot more of them around.
Before digging, make sure the area you plan to dig is open to shellfishing. Many of the beaches in southern Maine are closed to the digging of hen clams due to wastewater discharges and red tide. Visit the Department of Marine Resources website at www.maine.gov/dmr and click on the health and safety link. Maps and detailed descriptions will tell you what is open.
The recreational limit on sea clams is three bushels. Since a bushel of clams weighs in the vicinity of 80 pounds, one bushel is plenty, especially if you have to lug it any distance back to the truck.
Shucking the clams is rather easy, prying first at the hinge and then inserting the knife to separate clam from the shell. Give the clam a good rinse, then another and another. They can be sandy.
These clams are tougher than steamers, so most people grind or chop them, or cut them into strips. Once chopped, they are great in chowders, fritters, pasta and even pizzas. They freeze well, have great flavor and hold up well in a variety of recipes.
And of course they give you that taste of summer even if it's still spring.

WATERVILLE -- The chef spins an egg on the grill, flips it into the air with a spatula and catches it in his hat.
"Yummy, yummy egg!" he exclaims, as he cracks it, scraping yolk and white across the hot grill.
Patrons watch, wide-eyed, as he quickly and deftly tosses noodles, shrimp, vegetables, filet mignon and other fare onto the grill, swishing them around until cooked. He scoops them up and drops them onto their plates.
And then -- watch out -- he'll tell you to open wide as he squirts sake, an alcoholic Japanese drink, directly into your mouth. If you're an adult, that is.
Expect to hear lots of squeals and laughter if you dine at Mirakuya Steak House at JFK Plaza off Kennedy Memorial Drive.
Sunny Li and her partners chose Waterville to open the restaurant because they knew they would face little competition with their performance style of cooking.
"Mirakuya" means "tasty" in Japanese, according to Li. Whether you want to dine hibachi-style or prefer to be served at your table in a more traditional setting, you are guaranteed tasty, healthful food, she said.
"Most people come here for hibachi, but we have sushi in a regular dining area. We have a lot of dishes, fried rice and sauté, and you can order American food, filet mignon," she said. "We have everything. You name it -- live scallop, live oyster, sea urchin. A lot of people come here for sea urchin."
Sushi, or vinegary rice served with food such as raw fish or other seafood, is popular at the restaurant, according to Li. Contrary to what many people think, sushi is more than just raw fish, she said.
"It can be 80 percent cooked," she said. "People can have sushi roll. A bagel roll is very American-style. It is a deep-fried roll with eel, smoked salmon, cream cheese and scallion. It's really popular. Most of the sushi rolls are cooked but not heavy."
The fare is always fresh, she said, and good for you.
Patrons entering the restaurant are greeted by water cascading down a lighted wall; a full cocktail bar whose front panels change color also is available for people waiting to eat.
Li, 28, runs the business with Elin Lin and two others. Li grew up in China. When she was 19, she moved to New York City and worked at her uncle's restaurant, she said. She owns another restaurant in Pennsylvania.
She came to Maine from New York City two years ago for vacation and fell in love with the state, she said.
"You can ski and it's nice to raise your kids here. Every day you see different people; it's not boring. You are also chatting with people, and families. We have a lot of regular customers."

Ocean changes hitting fisheries

Full text:   Maine Sunday Telegram
Humans are dumping so much carbon dioxide into the oceans so fast that seawater -- even in the Gulf of Maine -- is getting warmer and more acidic, according to marine and climate researchers.
Scientists aren't sure yet how the trend, which is believed to be tied to human-induced climate change, will affect ocean life in the gulf. But there is rising concern -- especially among fishermen -- that changes in the ocean ecosystem could severely damage some of the fisheries that are the backbone of the region's seafood industry.
The effects of warming and acidification are showing up all over the world, including in and along the gulf.
"We've seen levels of acid that rival some of the highest levels recorded anywhere," said professor of marine science Mark Green, whose work at St. Joseph's College in Standish has focused exclusively on ocean acidification. "Many coastal areas are increasing three times faster than open ocean."
Lobsters are up, cod down. The herring caught in the gulf are much smaller than they were 20 years ago, marine scientists have observed. Northern right whales might leave altogether if populations of plankton are reduced enough to affect the whales' food supply.
Ocean acidification is a long, slow process in which seas absorb excessive amounts of carbon dioxide, enough to alter pH levels (the percentage of hydrogen, which is a measure of acidity and alkalinity).
Global surface waters have an average pH of 8.1, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But scientists believe that level could drop in the next 50 year to as low as 7.8, a huge change.
The impacts of increased carbon dioxide go far beyond making the water warmer and more acidic. Many species are weakened by the loss of oxygen and the spread of infectious diseases can speed up when water temperatures rise. Higher carbon dioxide levels in the ocean lead to an increase in carbonic acid, which reduces the availability of structural materials that mollusks and crustaceans need to form their shells.
The ranges of many species of sea life have been changed. Green crabs, for example, have moved in on shellfish beds in Maine from the more southerly waters they have traditionally inhabited.
"That's the really compelling story -- that there will be winners and losers," said Rick Wahle, research associate professor in the School of Marine Sciences at the University of Maine.
Absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the ocean waters has increased to about 100 times what it was 600 years ago, Green said. On average, ocean carbon dioxide levels are up 30 percent, most of it absorbed in the past 50 years. Exacerbating the problem is runoff from rivers polluted by fertilizer and soil erosion, and millions of tons of untreated sewage pumped into coastal waters, including Casco Bay.
Debate swirls about which stressors are to blame for which consequences, but one fact is undeniable: Ocean temperatures are rising and the water is becoming more acidic. The increased carbon dioxide in air and water comes largely from the burning of fossil fuels and emissions from factories, cars and power plants, most scientists say.
Complex issue
Some of the early evidence has been revealed by testing of pH levels in costal seawater and the monitoring of water and air temperatures over the past 15 years or so.
"I consider it to be an issue that merits better understanding," said Jeff Runge, professor of oceanography in the School of Marine Sciences at the University of Maine and a researcher at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland.
"It's starting to be recognized as a serious issue," he said. "But it's very complex. We're just not doing a very good job yet in understanding the biological and ecosystem effects in the Gulf of Maine."
Exactly what the changes mean and how they'll play out -- for marine life and the thousands of Mainers who get their livelihoods from the sea -- is not yet clear.
But it is no small matter. In 2012 alone, Maine's fisheries accounted for $521.5 million in revenue, with lobsters bringing in $349 million; soft-shell clams, $15.3 million; scallops, $2.9 million; blue mussels, $1.9 million; cod, $1.6 million; and oysters, $1.45 million, according to the state Department of Marine Resources.
"The clammers in our community (about 50 families) are very concerned about this ... and about losing their livelihoods," said Kristina Egan, vice-chair of the Freeport Town Council, which last year allocated $100,000 for a study of increasing numbers of green crabs overrunning the shellfish flats and eating immature clams.
"We're also concerned about losing this historic industry in Freeport," she said.
Chad Coffin, of Freeport, president of the Maine Clammers Association, says he believes ocean acidification is real, but it is not certain how serious it is for clammers or what can be done about it.
"I don't think it's a particularly big issue for the shellfish industry," Coffin said.
But the impact of green crab migration on shellfish beds is an immediate concern, he said.
"We're in big trouble," he said. "Green crabs have already eaten their way through the scallops, urchins, mussels and now clams."
If these aggressive predators are not stopped, he said, they could wipe out the resource and move on to lobsters -- a view shared by Carl Wilson, a marine resource scientist with the state Department of Marine Resources.
Freeport officials say they believe the crabs have proliferated because of at least a decade of relatively warmer winters and ocean temperatures that no longer dip much below 40 degrees -- not cold enough to cause the seasonal die-offs that keep the crab populations in check.
At least that's the theory. But there are still many unanswered questions about ocean acidification's effects on the state's fisheries.
"We are still learning about the details and implications," Wilson said.
"Ocean acidification is going to happen over a long period," he said. "The two (climate change and ocean acidification) are interrelated."
Marked changes
Wilson noted that a century of records from Boothbay Harbor indicate that eight of the 10 warmest summers have occurred in the past decade. Most researchers and observers agree that conditions in the gulf are markedly different than they were even 20 years ago.
Many fishermen fear that the changes do not bode well for the species they harvest. Though Maine lobstermen have enjoyed an almost quantum leap in their harvests in recent years, with a record haul in 2012; shellfishermen are struggling, and groundfishermen have watched their fishery virtually dry up.
"This very high abundance of lobster is very precarious," said Wilson. "That's the lesson we learned from southern New England and Cape Cod - warm water and other factors led to an eventual crash."
The annual lobster harvest has skyrocketed from 20 million pounds to nearly 125 million pounds in the past 25 years, and Wilson said there are no indications that the lobster population is going to collapse. The species is expanding in its northern range, and the distribution of lobsters is increasing east of Penobscot Bay. But populations south of Penobscot Bay may not fare as well, he said.
Wahle, the UMaine marine scientist, noted that ocean conditions in Maine are becoming more like Rhode Island or southern New England.
"That, in itself, is a bad thing," he said.
Rhode Island, New York and Connecticut have seen their lobster fisheries decimated by shell disease, first diagnosed in the 1980s and now linked to warmer water temperatures. The infection damages the exoskeleton with black spots, pits, ulcerations, and sometimes total rot. The disease does not taint the meat but renders the lobsters impossible to sell.
New York's $100 million industry has been crippled, affecting thousands of families, and the Connecticut Lobstermen's Association estimates the loss there at about $16 million per year.
The infections have not yet had a significant impact on Maine's lobster fishery; less than 1 percent have been infected, compared with 30 percent in southern New England, said Wahle.
"Those levels put the fear of God in Maine lobstermen," he said. We are perilously dependent on this one fishery."
Wahle said he has seen a slight uptick in the disease. "That raises some red flags for me," he said.
Wilson, at the marine resources department, sees an important change in people -- and how they regard the environment. In the 1970s, he said, environmental effects were assumed to be simple and relatively fixed.
But those days are over, he said, and science has yet to unravel the complex relationships among the factors that contribute to acidification, and the effects of that trend.
As perceptions of what is normal vacillate, the implications for fisheries management are profound.
"There are nuanced impacts," Wilson said. "If you're in a changing environment ... everything that's up is now down. You think you understand the system and you make your recommendations accordingly."

Full text:   The debate about the tar sands pipelines in Maine and the Midwest has centered on the potential for oil spills.
While spills are a significant risk, the impact on the climate is the overriding concern.
The change in the climate that already has occurred is obvious to anyone who spends time outdoors. Frost comes in mid-October instead of mid-September. Apple trees blossom in April. Lake ice is unsafe well into January. Insects such as ticks that were once frozen out of Maine are migrating north with the diseases they carry.
The United States and Canada are among the top per capita energy consumers in the developed world. In the United States, it is commonly accepted that cheap energy is a pre-requisite for a healthy economy. If so, why is Germany, where gas sells at $8.56 per gallon, the economic juggernaut of Europe?
In Maine, the long-term economic risks from a warming climate are lost in our focus on the short-term economy. Consider these risks:
* The ski and snowmobiling industries will suffer from less snow and shorter winters.
* The maple sugar industry will decline as maple trees die off.
* The shellfish industry will decline with warmer ocean water and carbon induced acidification.
* Coastal communities will experience more frequent and severe flooding.
We need to wean ourselves from fossil fuels, not add new sources with energy intensive extraction requirements. Climate scientists overwhelmingly recognize that the planet is warming dramatically and that the risks are daunting. A handful of bogus studies funded by ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel interests have perpetuated uncertainty.
We need President Barack Obama to require environmental impact assessments for pipelines carrying tar sands in Maine and elsewhere, and for Maine's congressional delegation to lead on federal climate policy.

Fishery disaster funds in doubt

Full text:   Washington Bureau Chief
WASHINGTON -- New England fishermen will have to wait at least several more weeks to find out whether Congress will provide federal aid to the region's struggling groundfishing industry.
On Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved an additional $9.7 billion for flood insurance claims for homeowners and business owners devastated by the storm Sandy in late October. The Senate, by comparison, had passed $60.4 billion in Sandy relief last month, including $150 million for federally designated fisheries disasters in the Northeast and elsewhere.
Now, fishermen and members of Congress from Northeastern states may have to fight to include the fisheries assistance in a second, larger Sandy relief bill slated for consideration in the House during the week of Jan. 14.
The situation in Congress is adding to uncertainty as Maine's groundfishing fleet braces for additional catch reductions from federal regulators.
"We are really disappointed that it was taken out," said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association, who is also sector manager for the Port Clyde Community Groundfish Sector.
Martens said fishermen are facing potentially disastrous cuts in their fishing allowances. The federal disaster aid could provide a level of financial assurance to the fleet -- already down to fewer than 50 boats in Maine -- by helping offset the costs of additional at-sea monitoring or sector management, Martens said.
"There is definitely a lot of concern in Maine and throughout New England," he said.
In September, the U.S. Department of Commerce declared that New England and several other Northeastern states were facing a commercial fishing failure because stocks of cod and other groundfish were not recovering, despite fishermen's compliance with strict catch limits.
The New England Fisheries Management Council is expected to tighten those limits even more later this month, potentially reducing some allowances by as much as 70 to 80 percent.
The federal disaster declaration opens the door to additional federal assistance to the states, which typically have broad discretion for using that money. Potential applications include funding research, defraying management costs or direct assistance to fishermen.
This is the fourth time since 2005 that a fishery in Maine was declared a commercial disaster. The three previous declarations applied to shellfish, which were devastated by red tide outbreaks.
The Senate's Sandy-relief bill -- which died Thursday with the closing of the 112th Congress -- included $150 million for the Northeastern groundfishery as well as for fishery disasters in Alaska, Mississippi, New York and New Jersey.
But some Republicans in the Senate opposed including the fisheries money as well as other non-Sandy related disasters in a bill that was supposed to help victims of the October storm. Those sentiments likely run even stronger in the Republican-controlled House, raising serious doubts about whether fisheries disasters unrelated to Sandy will be funded.
Fresh off a fight with his members over the fiscal cliff compromise, Republican House Speaker John Boehner opted to delay a vote on the Senate's $60.4 billion Sandy relief bill because of concern about the size and scope of the package. Boehner's decision outraged New York and New Jersey Republicans, however, and led to Friday's $9.7 billion bill followed by a larger aid package in two weeks.
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., defended the inclusion of non-Sandy related disasters in the bill, saying Congress has a long tradition of providing assistance to multiple events in a single bill. The Senate had also proposed funding for wildfires, drought and other disasters in recent years.
"The bottom line is none of this is extraneous to disasters," Schumer said in a press conference following the Senate vote on the $9.7 billion House bill. "If the House wants to take it out, we will have to deal with that in the Senate. It will obviously make some people not happy and may make it harder to pass."
Republican representatives from states covered by the fisheries disaster declarations have also spoken in support of including funding in the Sandy relief bill, as have all four members of Maine's delegation.
"We are very disappointed the money hasn't been included," said Willy Ritch, spokesman for Maine U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District. "Chellie has been arguing that the money for New England fisheries should be included as part of the package and will continue to do that."

Groundfishing funds OK'd in Senate bill

Full text:   Washington Bureau Chief
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Senate passed a $60 billion disaster relief bill Friday that includes funding to support struggling groundfishing fleets in Maine and other Northeastern states.
On a 60-35 vote, senators defeated an attempt to strip $150 million in funding for four federally designated fisheries disasters -- including the Northeast groundfishery -- from the larger relief bill for mid-Atlantic states that were hit by Hurricane Sandy in October.
Maine's Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe voted to maintain the fisheries funding.
The bill now goes to the Republican-controlled House, where it could face stronger opposition because of its size and scope.
If approved by the House as written, the relief bill will likely provide millions of dollars to support Maine's groundfishing fleet, which has shrunk to just a few dozen boats and faces additional austere catch limits on cod and other species.
Maine, like other states, would likely have broad flexibility in its use of the money.
Meredith Mendelson, deputy commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, said the highest-priority uses for the funding would be to help fishermen cover the cost of at-sea monitoring and other fishing-sector management costs.
"Those costs are typically paid for now by individual members of groundfishing sectors," said Mendelson.
The priorities were identified by state officials and fishermen, who typically have opposed direct payments to fishermen, Mendelson said. But even if the line item survives a House vote, Maine won't expect large sums.
"We would want to be very targeted in how any resources are appropriated, should that happen," she said.
Cod fishing is often credited with helping to build New England in Colonial America. But overfishing and other factors have depleted cod stocks, prompting austere catch limits on the relatively few groundfish boats that still operate.
Most Maine fishermen have switched to lobster or other species, leaving fewer than 50 boats in the state with federal permits. And the region's fishermen are bracing for catch limits on some species that are 70 to 80 percent lower next year than in 2011.
The Northeastern groundfishery became eligible for additional federal support in September when the U.S. Department of Commerce declared it an economic disaster. It was the fourth time since 2005 that a fishery in Maine had been declared a commercial disaster, with the other three covering shellfish because of red tide.
It is up to Congress to appropriate money, so lawmakers from the region inserted a budget item into the superstorm Sandy disaster relief bill.
The bill contains disaster assistance for three other fisheries: Chinook salmon in Alaska, blue crabs in Mississippi, and fleets in New York and New Jersey that were affected by Hurricane Sandy.
Some senators objected to the inclusion, arguing that the $60 billion relief bill was laden with issues unrelated to Hurricane Sandy that could be handled separately next year.
They also argued that any funding for the fisheries disaster should be offset by spending cuts elsewhere.
"All we are doing is stealing from our kids," said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a vocal critic of government borrowing and the author of the amendment to strip the fisheries funding from the bill.
"If we're going to do $150 million for fisheries, ought we not cut spending somewhere else to pay for it?"
Senators from the affected states cautioned their colleagues against setting a precedent that would require offsets that could delay funding for future natural or economic disasters.
Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., pointed out that Congress approved disaster relief within two weeks of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, while two months have passed without a disaster bill for Sandy's victims.
Menendez said he welcomed the inclusion of funding for other disasters.

Maine boys work to protect nautilus

Full text:   Portland Press Herald
The chambered nautilus, a prehistoric mollusk whose shell is a nearly perfect spiral, is being hunted to extinction because of its beauty.
While the world has yet to pay much attention to the issue, two boys in Maine have emerged among the loudest voices urging protection for the species.
Josiah Utsch, 12, of Cape Elizabeth, and Ridgely Kelly, 11, of Bremen, have raised nearly $10,000 to buy underwater equipment for scientists studying the creatures. Most of the money has come from other children.
"It's been a kid-driven thing so far," said Elise Strong, Josiah's mother. "We hope to get the adults involved."
Publicity generated by the boys has raised awareness about the issue, said Peter Ward, a biologist at the University of Washington. "They have very much played a huge part in saving the nautilus."
The chambered nautilus, which lives in the Pacific Ocean near Asia, is considered a living fossil. Modern nautiluses are nearly identical to fossilized nautiluses that are nearly 200 million years old, Ward said.
The nautilus has experienced little evolutionary change because of its stable habitat -- deep-water slopes adjacent to coral reefs, Ward said.
The nautilus uses tentacles to catch small prey, like shrimp. It also scavenges dead creatures that tumble down from coral reefs.
The spiraled shell of the nautilus is divided into chambers, with the animal occupying the outermost chamber. The inner chambers, filled with gas, help the nautilus maintain neutral buoyancy.
Fishermen catch the softball-size creatures with traps that operate like lobster traps. It takes a nautilus 15 years to reach sexual maturity, so it is vulnerable to overfishing, Ward said.
Josiah said it's hard to imagine that an animal that has survived for 200 million years could become extinct in his lifetime.
"It would be a tragedy to survive a ton of mass extinctions and have them wiped out by a human mass extinction," he said.
A year ago, Josiah's grandmother sent him a New York Times article reporting that fishermen have been killing nautiluses by the millions to meet the growing worldwide demand for their lustrous shells.
The opalescent material from the shells' inner surface is ground into pearl shapes and sold as a cheaper alternative to pearls, usually marketed as Osmeña pearl.
Unlike rhinoceros horns or elephant tusks, which are considered contraband, nautilus shells have no protection, and the threat to the species has gone largely unnoticed by the public, the article noted.
Internet search results for the phrase "save the nautilus" are dominated by www.savethenautilus.com, the website the Maine boys created a year ago, and links to news articles about their efforts.
Eager to donate money to help one of his favorite animals, Josiah contacted Ward, who was quoted in the New York Times article, and asked if there was an organization devoted to helping the nautilus. Ward said there was no such group.
So Josiah, with help from his friend Ridgely, created the website and started accepting donations, using the nonprofit status of the University of Washington.
The boys also started selling Save the Nautilus T-shirts, designed by Ridgely.
Time for Kids magazine published a story about their campaign earlier this year, and soon the boys began getting emails and handwritten letters from teachers and children from around the nation. They also began receiving checks.
Children raised money walking dogs, donating their allowances and asking friends to donate in lieu of birthday presents.
A 9-year-old boy from Bloomfield, N.J., sent a check for $12, saying he had raised the money by selling pencils.
One girl, Victoria, 11, from Uniondale, N.Y., wrote to the boys that she had read about their campaign at school.
"I want to help save the nautilus," she wrote. "Here is $20 doolers."
A 12-year-old girl named Sadie from Palm Beach County, Fla., created a list of websites of companies that sell nautilus shells. She sent the list to the boys, who put the information on their website.
Ward said more data is needed about the range and abundance of the nautilus to enable scientists to estimate its population and determine a sustainable catch. Ward and other marine biologists are lobbying for protection of the nautilus under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, the United Nations rules that combat illegal trade in species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants.
The boys, who went to Washington state recently to meet with Ward, will go to American Samoa in February to help with his study. Their parents will pay for the trip, and Ward will provide housing.
Ward said the boys will go scuba diving and help him determine how fast the nautilus can swim, and how long it takes it to reach its natural habitat, as much as 2,000 feet below the surface, after it is dropped at the surface.
He said the boys will monitor the creatures with radio transmitters attached to their shells.
Ward, 63, said he's impressed by the boys' passion for science, and their persistence and ability to work hard.
"They remind me of myself when I was young," he said.

Full text:   Associated Press
PORTLAND -- For the first time, scientists have figured out how to determine the age of a lobster -- by counting its rings, like a tree.
Nobody knows how old lobsters can live to be; some people estimate they live to more than 100.
But knowing -- rather than simply guessing -- their age and that of other shellfish could help scientists better understand the population and assist regulators of the lucrative industry, said Raouf Kilada, a research associate at the University of New Brunswick who was the lead author of a scientific paper documenting the process.
Before now, scientists deduced a lobster's age judging by size and other variables. But it's now known that lobsters and other crustaceans, such as crabs and shrimp, grow one ring per year in hidden-away internal spots, Kilada said.
"Having the age information for any commercial species will definitely improve the stock assessment and ensure sustainability," he said after presenting his findings Thursday at a scientific conference in Portland.
Scientists already could tell a fish's age by counting the growth rings found in a bony part of its inner ear, a shark's age from the rings in its vertebrae and a scallop or clam's age from the rings of its shell.
But crustaceans posed a problem because of the apparent absence of any permanent growth structures. It was thought that when lobsters and other crustaceans molt, they shed all calcified body parts that might record annual growth bands.
For their research, Kilada and five other Canadian researchers took a closer look at lobsters, snow crabs, northern shrimp and sculptured shrimp.
They found that growth rings, in fact, could be found in the eyestalk -- a stalk connected to the body with an eyeball on the end -- of lobsters, crabs and shrimp. In lobsters and crabs, the rings were also found in the so-called "gastric mills," parts of the stomach with three teeth-like structures used to grind up food.
To find the growth bands, the scientists dissected the eyestalks and the gastric mills, cut out sections and viewed them under microscopes.
Lobsters don't lose reproductive capabilities or organ functions or exhibit signs of aging as they get older, but nobody knows for sure how old they can live to be.
"We've thought lobsters could live to 100 years old, and this new aging technique will be a way to document that," said Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine's Lobster Institute.
The paper was published in this month's Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, a well-regarded peer-reviewed scientific journal based in Ottawa, Ontario, that has been published since 1901.
Kilada's was one of more than 50 scientific presentations at the conference, attended by more than 100 lobster scientists from the United States, Canada and Europe.
Bayer agreed that this is the first time scientists have a direct method to place an age on crustaceans.
"Right now we're just guessing at their age," he said.
Kilada said he saw lobster specimens that were 16 or 17 years old during his research. He estimates that there are lobsters 60 or 70 years old living in the wild.
Susan Waddy, a lobster researcher with Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans, said she has kept lobsters in her laboratory that are more than 30 years old. She suspects they live to be 40 or 50.
"We know they don't live forever," she said.

It is here that the Damariscotta River Association, established in 1973, has worked to protect 2,900 acres of land and 22 miles of shoreline. Hikers can take advantage of numerous opportunities to explore this special area starting with the Hart Family Heritage Trail, which makes a 3-mile loop through the DRA's Great Salt Bay Preserve in Newcastle.
The trail starts on Mill Road (Route 215) near the Newcastle post office just off Route 1. The path begins by circling a cove through eel grass meadows before entering the woods and swinging around Grandfather Point. After crossing a footbridge, the trail reaches the white pines on Picnic Point and then proceeds to Lookout Point, with lots of great views out across Great Salt Bay en route. At low tide you can poke among the rocks and seaweed, where you're likely to find not only abundant clam and mussel shells, but horseshoe crab shells as well. Gulls, cormorants, herons, kingfishers, ospreys and eagles are common here.
Ahead, the trail passes a large erratic before cutting across Glidden Point and crossing underneath Route 1 by way of a tunnel. Just beyond, a short spur trail leads to the Damariscotta River and the Glidden Midden, one of the largest oyster shell heaps remaining in the eastern U.S. Accumulated over several thousand years by Native Americans, this incredible shell heap is 30 feet deep, 150 feet long and 75 feet wide. The trail finishes through mixed woods, passing a tidal salt marsh and freshwater pond.
For hikers with time to spare, there's much more to see and do. Plan to make a day of it if you can.
On the southeast shore of the bay is Great Salt Bay Farm, a lovely 100-acre preserve of rolling fields, salt and freshwater marshes, woods, and a mile of water frontage.
Here also is the Salt Bay Farm Heritage Center, an 18th-century farmhouse that is home to the DRA. The center is busy year-round with a wide variety of environmental education programs and cultural events, all open to the public.
Four trails wind through the pretty farmstead, offering several miles of hiking. Combine the Bayside, Fox Run and Blackstone trails for a pleasant loop walk. Dogs are allowed off leash on the Back Meadow Loop across the road.
A short distance south of the farm is the Whaleback Shell Midden, a state historic site. Situated on the east bank of the Damariscotta River across from Glidden Point, the oyster shells of this once enormous midden were mined in the late 1800s to supply a chicken feed processing operation. Only a fraction of the original midden remains, but the history is nonetheless fascinating. A half-mile interpretive trail loops through the property.
On the northwest side of Great Salt Bay is the historic Fish Ladder at Damariscotta Mills. Built in 1807, the ladder provides passage for spawning alewives, also known as river herring, on their annual migration from the ocean to Damariscotta Lake.
The fish ladder, comprised of 1,500 linear feet of stone walls, rises 42 feet from the bay to the lake. Some 300,000 alewives make the journey each year. Restoration of the ladder began in 2007, and a short pathway gives visitors a close-up look at this amazing spot and the work in progress to protect this important fishery.

Full text:   BY EDWARD D. MURPHY
Portland Press Herald
PORTLAND -- After dealing with a lobster glut and low prices this summer, Peter McAleney felt the seafood industry was finally starting to stabilize this fall.
That is, until Superstorm Sandy rolled up the coast and spread not only physical devastation, but also triggered more upheaval in seafood markets.
"There's been nothing going on -- no trucks, planes or anything going down through Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania," said McAleney, who owns New Meadows Lobster Co. "People aren't interested in seafood right now. They're interested in getting their lives back in order."
The result is likely to be a repeat of this summer's lobster glut, but spread throughout the entire industry this time, with plenty of both fish and shellfish in Maine markets because the demand has dropped out of sight in the major markets of the Northeast.
McAleney said he lost a big order from Pennsylvania Thursday morning because his customer decided he wouldn't sell much lobster to thousands of people still without electricity.
"Seafood is the last thing you're going to bring home to a house without power," said Chris Fream, senior sales executive with North Atlantic Seafood in Portland.
The industry's "wheels are falling off," said Fream. "New York is not taking fish and all the seaside restaurants up and down the East Coast are not open or not having any demand."
Fream said the major fish markets in and around New York aren't selling much fish and, consequently, aren't buying any. The restaurants that still have power also aren't buying seafood because families who have no electricity and have to eat out are still more likely to opt for a quick, cheap fast-food meal than a leisurely seafood dinner.
Fream said he's even gotten calls from fishing boat captains down in Massachusetts looking for a buyer for their catch. Those boats generally sell to markets in Massachusetts, he said.
Fream and others in the industry noted that there was also a jump in landings last weekend as fishing fleets headed into port to avoid the storm barreling up the coast.
The Portland Fish Exchange auction handled 65,643 pounds of fish on Saturday, selling all but 500 pounds of what was offered. Prices were holding up, with large cod going for an average of $4.53 a pound and large dab getting $2.05 a pound.
After being closed for two days, fishermen took just 9,502 pounds to the auction Thursday, and sold only 7,519 pounds. Large cod brought an average of just $3.43 a pound and large dab sold for 60 cents a pound, even though only miniscule amounts of both species were offered for sale.
"It sucks," said Jared Auerbach, owner of Red's Best seafood in Boston, which handles a fair amount of fish caught by Maine fishermen. "There's just no demand and it's killing people right now."
Auerbach said he's facing a potentially significant loss because he didn't think Sandy would be as bad as it was. The markets, he thought, might be disrupted for a day or two, but then would return to normal.
"The fish we bought (last weekend), we ended up overpaying for because I didn't anticipate the storm would be as bad as it was," he said.. "Now, our customers don't have power and some don't even have phone lines."
But, as with the lobster glut this fall, the current situation offers a bright side for local seafood lovers.
"All the boats came in at once and there's been a glut of seafood for the last few days," said Nick Alfiero, whose family runs Harbor Fish Market on the Portland waterfront.
"People are begging me to take product and we just can't do it," he said. "Every dealer in Boston has fish in the coolers they're trying to sell."
But that means prices will fall for consumers, particularly this weekend, Alfiero said.
"I think people will get sick and tired of sitting around the house" and head out, either to eat in a restaurant or to buy something to cook at home -- and Alfiero thinks the low prices will mean they will go for fish, which would help ease some of the glut the market is experiencing.

Commerce dept. calls groundfishing season disaster

Full text:   Washington Bureau Chief
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of Commerce declared a disaster for New England's struggling groundfishing fleet for the 2013 season, opening the door for Congress to appropriate up to $100 million to help fishermen.
The declaration follows recent studies that find stocks of cod and other species are not recovering as quickly as expected despite the industry's compliance with strict catch limitations. Gov. Paul LePage requested the disaster declaration last November.
"I've been in the business over 30 years, and this is the worst I have ever seen it," said fisherman Tom Casamassa of Saco, one of the few Mainers still fishing for cod, haddock, flounder and other groundfish. Maine is home to just 45 boats in the groundfish fleet, as others have switched to lobster and other species.
"Talking to other fishermen, they are shaking their heads and don't know what to do. ... We're really glad they moved ahead with the disaster declaration. From the sound of it, New England is really going to need it," Casamassa said Thursday.
Cod fishing was once the economic backbone of much of New England, including Maine; but overfishing and other factors have depleted cod stocks, resulting in austere catch limits on the relatively few groundfish boats still operating. Now the fleet faces additional reductions of up to 70 percent in the amount of cod and other species they can land.
Many now fear that this once-robust fishery -- often credited with helping build New England and Colonial America -- is in jeopardy of disappearing. Maine is home to just 45 boats with federal permits, as most fishermen have switched to lobster and other species.
Like many of his colleagues, Casamassa has been forced to branch out into other fisheries such as shrimp, lobster and even dogfish -- a kind of "trash fish," to some -- in order to survive. While he used to catch groundfish relatively close to shore, Casamassa now describes water down to 50 fathoms -- or 300 feet deep -- as "a desert."
"The future challenges facing the men and women in this industry and the shore-based businesses that support them are daunting, and we want to do everything we can to help them through these difficult times," Rebecca Blank, acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, said in a statement.
A statement by U.S. Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins and U.S. Reps. Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree says they're encouraged by the disaster declaration, which acknowledges that Maine's fishermen are facing new and unprecedented challenges. The delegation's statement says the declaration is a first step in a long effort to rebuild one of the nation's first industries.
This is not the first Maine fishery to be granted disaster status, nor is it uncommon nationwide.
In 2010, for instance, shellfish harvesters in Maine were eligible for federal disaster assistance after the Commerce Department, which oversees NOAA, declared that the 2009 outbreak of red tide created a commercial fishing failure. Two other fisheries -- salmon in Alaska and oysters and crabs in Mississippi -- also were declared disasters on Thursday.
Numerous fishermen's organizations, including the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association that Casamassa belongs to, applauded the declaration.
"NSC views federal disaster relief as an important component of a plan for 2013 and beyond," read a statement from the Northeast Seafood Coalition, whose members hold more than 500 groundfish permits. "It provides fishermen with an essential bridge to the future when fundamental, longer-term solutions can be implemented."
Meredith Mendelson, deputy commissioner at the Maine Department of Marine Resources, said the declaration is federal acknowledgement that something other than "fishing pressure" is slowing the recovery of fish stocks.
"Fishermen have been staying within their catch limits for several years now," Mendelson. "So it is not the fault of the industry. There is something else going on in the environment."
A May report suggested that Gulf of Maine cod populations were at 58 percent of what managers believe are healthy levels, while Georges Bank cod were at 12 percent.
As a result, federal fisheries regulators reduced the quota for 2012 and are expected to slash the catch limits further in 2013 -- some by as much as 70 percent from 2012 levels.
A letter from LePage and other governors said the money would be "used to provide both immediate economic relief to our region's struggling groundfish industry and to make targeted investments that will allow the fleet to survive and become more sustainable in the years ahead."
Although funding is not guaranteed, U.S. Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said Thursday that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has committed to include the $100 million for fishermen and fishing communities in emergency assistance legislation. That bill will be debated during the lame-duck session after the election, Kerry said Thursday.
Mendelson said discussions are ongoing about how to use any emergency assistance funding appropriated by Congress.
Options include funding additional research on why groundfish are disappearing, development of new gear to better target specific species or using the money to help offset other costs, such as the amount the industry pays for at-sea catch monitors.
Another option is direct relief payments to fishermen or "buys out" of permit holders.
However, Mendelson said disaster relief for fishermen is not the same as disaster relief for farmers.
"There have been direct payments (to fishermen) in the past, but there is no insurance like crop insurance," Mendelson said.
Kerry made a similar comparison, saying fishermen are just as dependent on the vagaries of the ecosystem as farmers are and just as deserving of assistance when things go bad through no fault of their own.
"We put billions into the heartland of our country for farmers -- billions, literally," Kerry said. "When you have a massive layoff of an industry like that because of circumstances that are entirely outside the fishing industry's control, we have to respond as a country."
Casamassa said he and other fishermen hope money will be used to improve the research and science that guides NOAA catch limits.
"Nobody wants a handout. Everyone wants to fish," he said in a conference call with reporters organized by the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association and the Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fishermen's Association. "There is a problem in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, and we need to figure it out and to fix it."
Maine's congressional delegation, which had supported the state's pursuit of a disaster declaration, cheered the announcement on Thursday and pledged to continue working to secure funding.
"It is now time for Congress to support this industry by lowering operating costs for this upcoming fishing year and by investing in the resource for the long-term through scientific research to better understand these challenges," the delegation said in a joint statement. "This declaration is a first step in a long effort to rebuild one of our nation's first industries."

It may be a summer of squid -- well, for most people

Full text:   It's been three nights and I've struck out each night. In baseball I'd be headed to the bench. In fishing, well, so what? I'm headed right back out again.
Three different times this year I have tried my luck catching squid. I am 0-for-August.
Yet I keep hearing that the squid are here. The local tackle shop ordered more than 100 squid jigs earlier this summer after selling out its first order. Boat fishermen are inadvertently catching them on mackerel sabiki rigs. Friends are seeing squid at docks and in coves. The only squid I've seen were coughed up by cod and haddock, or on a restaurant platter.
For me it's been a little bit like winter smelt fishing, where often I hear "you should have been here last tide."
While each year there are reports of successful squid jiggers early in the season, this summer anglers are catching squid like no other.
Explanations as to why vary. Certainly it was an early spring. Since early June, it's been relatively dry.
Winds and currents don't seem to be as strong, either, allowing ocean temperatures to warm more than usual. In fact, temperatures offshore at Jeffreys Ledge last week were in the high 60s and sharks were abundant.
Squid love the warmer water. In the winter, they are found offshore in the deeper water that is spared the freezing coastal temperatures. As the water warms, they begin their migration inshore.
Squid are mollusks, related to clams, oysters and scallops. But squid are different in that they lack an external shell. They do, however, have an internal shell, and that's a transparent support structure called a pen inside their mantle or body.
The Gulf of Maine is home to two squid species, long-finned squid that grow up to 17 inches in length, and boreal or short-finned squid that are up to 9 inches in length. I wish I could tell you which type I've been catching but well, you know the story.
Squid move along their way by drawing water into their mantle cavity and expelling it out a siphon at the base of their mantle. This quickly propels them through the water.
As is well known, squid also possess an ink sac, which they excrete for a magic act that allows them to disappear from many predators.
Squid use their two long tentacles and eight shorter arms to capture food and transfer it to their mouth, which consists of a hard beak at the central base of their head. Adult squid feed on small fish such as herring, mackerel, hake and menhaden, among others. But just about every type of adult fish feast on squid, making squid a vital link in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem.
Most squid fisherman are having luck at night. Inshore squid are drawn to bright lights, and anglers using squid jigs on lobster wharves, town docks and marina piers are having luck. Tide doesn't seem to matter, but being at the right place at the right time does. Boat anglers and some savvy dock anglers have used submersible lights with great success.
Squid jigs, a brightly colored, sometimes glowing torpedo-shaped jig that instead of hook seems has two rings of upturned needles, are working for most folks. I am going to try some different colors in different locations in hopes of finding the right combination. This summer you can find them at most tackle shops if they aren't sold out.
Earlier this summer, I was told that you could catch them on any dock with a light. After I proved that wrong, I have been pointed to docks and wharves in Portland, Harpswell and Boothbay. I have heard whisperings of other locations, which I plan to keep secret but may share in success.
I planned my next squidding sojourn for this week, and the cod, mackerel, blues and bass will have to wait, because what began as a curiosity has now turned into a quest.
A quest that can only successfully end with a catch of calamari.

Full text: A tragedy over the Independence Day holiday involving a 34-foot Silverton cabin cruiser in Oyster Bay, N.Y., brings to light a hazard that may not be at the top of every boater's list of concerns: passenger and load limits.
The investigation into the Oyster Bay tragedy is far from complete; in fact, the craft was just raised to the surface on July 11.
What is known is that the boat was carrying 27 adults and children on an excursion to view fireworks. It overturned and sank, and three children were lost.
Along with the number of people aboard, and whether there were enough properly sized personal flotation devices for each of them, authorities will likely look at factors such as mechanical issues, alcohol consumption, the boat's operation, and environmental variables like the weather, sea state and boat traffic at the time of the accident.
Meanwhile, the conversations on the water, on the docks and on social media sites frequented by boaters continue to focus on the possibility that the Silverton may have had too many people on board.
Overloading a boat can indeed be dangerous. And the smaller the boat, the easier it is to become overloaded. Putting too many people and too much gear aboard reduces freeboard, increases instability and raises the risk of swamping in rough weather. Even in calm waters, an overloaded boat is more likely to capsize, especially if the boat makes an abrupt turn, or if someone on board suddenly shifts position.
It's important for any boat owner to know the capacity of his or her craft. In some cases, it's pretty straightforward; in others, it's not.
Federal regulations require boats under 20 feet to have a capacity plate permanently affixed to the hull by the manufacturer. The label indicates what's safe to carry in terms of engine horsepower, cargo and passengers.
If a capacity plate isn't present, a publication from the Coast Guard's Boating Safety Division offers a formula for calculating the maximum number of passengers for a small monohull boat: Multiply the boat's length by its width and divide by 15. People who operate small boats should keep within the maximums stated on the capacity plate, and if it's windy or choppy, stay well under those limits.
To make capsizing even less likely, the Boating Safety Division recommends that loads on small boats be distributed evenly to keep the boat balanced.
Standing in small boats, even changing seating positions, can raise the center of gravity and make the boat less stable. The same is true for sitting on the gunwales or seat backs, or on a pedestal seat while under way. A raised center of gravity means that a wave, wake or sudden turn can cause a person to fall overboard.
For larger recreational boats, like that 34-foot Silverton in Oyster Bay, passenger and load limits are not as clear cut. The "length times beam divided by 15" formula described above is not recommended for boats over 26 feet.
Case in point: The formula tells me our Pearson 34 sloop could accommodate up to 22 people. There is no way the skipper or I would consider putting even half that many people on board.
Yacht designers base capacity limits for larger boats on a stability formula that is far too complex to explain here. And because capacity plates are not required, common sense needs to come into play.
Some people recommend putting only as many people on board as you have seats for. But many boats, specifically sailboats, don't always have designated seats.
Some sailors I know will limit passengers to the number of sleeping berths on the boat -- certainly safe, maybe even a bit conservative.
My favorite among owners of cruising sailboats in the 30- to 35-foot range is this pragmatic approach that works for both safety and comfort: "She drinks six, feeds four and sleeps two." Those numbers can be tweaked according to boat size, sea conditions and purpose and length of the trip.
What is indisputable is that boats of any size must carry a properly sized, wearable PFD for every passenger, and those PFDs work only if people wear them. Here in Maine, children 10 and under must wear them at all times while on board.
Boating season is now in high gear, and a little knowledge and common sense can help to ensure a safe summer on the water.

NEWPORT -- Friday night's commencement at Nokomis Regional High School was a bittersweet moment for many in the packed auditorium.
As the 143 graduates said farewell to their classmates and teachers, Regional School Unit 19 said goodbye to Superintendent William P. Braun, who retires June 30 after 18 years in the district.
"I came here the year most of these kids were born, and I've watched around 3,000 graduate since then," Braun said.
The common theme of the class of 2012 was to not only think outside the box, but -- as valedictorian Brynn Hayden-Sawyer Cardozo of Palmyra put it -- "shape your world to fit your ideals. You can change what you have, what you own and who you associate with. By changing your surroundings, you can change your reality. By changing your reality, you change your world."
Cardozo, who plans to attend Worcester Polytechnic Institute to major in biomedical engineering, said that it's customary for students to thanks their parents on such an occasion.
"Normally, we roll our eyes and oblige; but rarely do we realize that the words spoken are nothing but the purest form of the truth. Whether we like it or not, our parents are the sole reason we stand here today," she said.
She also praised what she termed "the crazy ones ... the round pegs in the square holes," citing an advertising campaign by Apple in 1997. "You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them, because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward."
Principal Mary Nadeau told the 44th graduating class of Nokomis Regional High School, "You have been willing to take on new challenges. You have had the courage to stand up for yourself, for others and for injustices. You have led by persevering through tough times and demonstrating a 'can do' attitude."
"The quality I see most often, and makes me proud, is your ability to show kindness to others," Nadeau said. "I see it in the littlest gestures, whether it is holding a door open, a friendly smile or a helping hand; and in more significant ways, like befriending a new student or sharing what you have with someone less fortunate."
Braun noted that "there are times when our graduates ask what the last 13 or 14 years of education were for, and why did they go through them? Let me suggest that they were not to prepare you to end or conclude a portion of your life, but rather to prepare you for a new beginning."
He also cautioned them not to let the comforts of life overshadow their goals. "The oyster has a good life and hard shell for protection. Its food it delivered to its mouth by the ocean currents. The oyster, however, is stuck on the bottom."
Braun asked the class to not play it safe when challenges seem insurmountable.
"Rise up and take charge of your future. You now have the magic formula for achieving success in a positive way. You can take on anything and prove your worth. Dare to be great."
Rep. Kenneth Fredette, R-Newport, gave a brief speech and presented congratulations from the Legislature to Cardozo and salutatorian Alyssa Ann Taylor, of St. Albans.

Full text: I got fooled again. My wife and I were recently looking out over Johnson Bay, a small embayment in Lubec that is a part of Cobscook Bay. Over the water I saw a long string of dark material. I thought it was a line of algal wrack, carried offshore by the powerful tides in Cobscook Bay and caught at the interface between two currents.
But no, the wrack started to disappear. I was looking at a flock of about 150 Black Scoters.
Black Scoters outside of the breeding season are often gregarious, sticking close together on the water either in a snake-like conga line or in a tight circle. I don't know of any other ducks that engage in this behavior. Perhaps you have seen Black Scoters in tight formations. This linear arrangement is seen in flight as well. A line of scoters will fly just above the sea, rising and falling as they pass over waves.
Black Scoters are one of three scoters that are seen regularly in Maine from the fall until the late spring. Surf Scoters and White-winged Scoters are the other two species.
Black Scoters were once called Common Scoters in North American field guides. As a budding birder in North Carolina, I was perplexed by the name because Surf Scoters and White-winged Scoters were far more "common" than the Common Scoter. I like Black Scoter better.
By the way, if you are wondering about the derivation of the name "scoter," its origin is unknown.
Black Scoters are pretty easy to identify. Adults males are entirely black except for a yellow-orange protuberance on top of the bill. That protuberance can be seen from great distances through binoculars. Females are dark brown except for a distinctive two-toned head (dark cap and whitish cheeks). Both sexes are fairly easy to distinguish from the other two scoters.
Some controversy exists over whether the Black Scoters we have in North America are the same species as the ones occurring in Europe and Asia. The Old World form (subspecies or species) is called the Common Scoter.
Black Scoters winter along both coasts of North America, from the Aleutians to the Baja Peninsula on the West Coast and Newfoundland to the central Texas coast in the East. Despite the broad distribution, Black Scoters are one of our least-known ducks. The main reason for this lack of information stems from the highly disjunct and limited breeding range. These scoters nest on lakes in northwestern Alaska and northern Quebec. Much remains to be learned about their breeding behavior and ecology.
Black Scoters dive for their food but are not chasing fish as many birders assume. Rather, they are bottom feeders.
In freshwater, Black Scoters feed mainly on aquatic insects, with a particular fondness for caddisfly larvae. In marine waters, the diet is mostly bivalves (clams and mussels) and snails. Scoters usually feed in waters less than 30 feet deep. Once at the bottom, they may take mussels or snails on the surface or excavate the sediment to extract buried clams. It's no surprise they need to be in fairly shallow water.
Black Scoters are powerful divers. On the surface of the water with their wings closed, they seem to leap above the water and neatly slice into it, disappearing in the blink of an eye. Sometimes they propel themselves with their feet and, in some populations, they will use half-extended wings to help propel them to the bottom.
Which brings us back to the beginning. Why arrange themselves in tight lines or circles? If scoters were fish eaters, perhaps they could herd fish into a tight ball. But no one needs to herd sessile mussels or slow-moving snails. We have to simply accept the fact that Black Scoters are sociable creatures.

State wants help fighting potato blight

Full text: Staff Writer
AUGUSTA -- Much of the state's seed potato supply for this year is infected with blight and the state has asked the federal government for an emergency exemption to make an effective but expensive toxic seed treatment available to farmers.
"The time is pretty germane to have it now," said Steve Johnson, a crops specialist with the University of Maine cooperative extension. "The pathogen has been found in seeds, and so the last thing we want to do is start our own epidemic by planting these seeds."
Extreme wet weather and infected seed potatoes that were imported during the 2011 growing season resulted in a severe outbreak of late blight on Maine's potato crop. Saturated soil late in the season transferred it to the tubers in the ground, Johnson said.
To ward against another severe outbreak of late blight on Maine's potato crop, the Board of Pesticides Control has asked the federal government for an emergency exemption registration for Revus fungicide, an expensive pesticide that's mildly to highly toxic to different species.
Revus is new on the market and is registered for blight control in the U.S. for grapes and vegetables, including potatoes, but not for seed potato pieces, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Johnson said Revus is an effective plant health medicine on the path of becoming a fully registered material, but not in time for this year's potato growing season.
If the exemption is granted, farmers will weigh the high cost of the fungicide -- $350 a gallon -- against the potential money they'd lose if blight ruined their crop.
Bruce Flewelling, a potato grower in Easton, said it will cost about $20,000 to treat seeds with Revus on his 1,000-acre farm.
"I'm looking at using it. I'm excited to use it, but then I looked at the price tag," Flewelling said. "There again, if we do get blight, everything goes out the window. If we can keep it out (of our crop) it's better for me and my budget. Last year it was a nightmare. We had a rough time with the wet weather."
Flewelling said Revus is a good chemical that he has sprayed over the top of his potato plants over the past four years, but never on seed pieces.
"It's a big area, so we would use it on all the seed we got," he said.
Paul Schlein, spokesman for the Maine Board of Pesticides Control, said Maine has about 56,000 acres of potatoes. An average farm is about 190 acres. He said it would cost a potato grower using Revus between $15 and $30 an acre depending on the potato variety.
Johnson said it could cost farmers $3,000 per acre if blight hits their crops. He said potato farmers suffered tremendous losses last year because of the blight. On top of the unprecedented rain, Tropical Storm Irene spread the epidemic to other fields.
The state board unanimously approved the request and sent it along to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for consideration, which has 50 days to make a decision, Johnson said.
"They approved this material in Montana, so it isn't unprecedented," he said. "They will let us know within 50 days, which is a little bit too long." He said the treatment has to be done before planting and ideally, the seed would be treated in April for May planting. He added the federal government is aware of the time crunch, so may act fast.
"That's a serious loss," he said. "This is trying to control and manage the disease."
Rob Johanson, a certified organic grower in Dresden, said he will treat his potato seeds this year with biological inoculates to protect them from blight.
"It's the only thing we got going to protect the plants in an organic system. We don't have chemicals like the other guys," he said.
Revus contains the active ingredient mandipropamid. According to a 2008 California Department of Pesticide Regulation Public Report, mandipropamid is slightly toxic to birds and honeybees, moderately toxic to fish and some shrimp, and highly toxic to eastern oyster.
Denis Thoet, who grows potatoes on his small West Gardiner farm each year for his community-supported agriculture customers, said he would never pre-treat anything with chemicals.
He said the use of a fungicide like Revus only benefits large-scale potato farms in Maine.
"It's not good for you and probably not good for the plant," Thoet said. "There's other ways to control blight. Our crop was affected in 2009. That's the first year blight was a factor in small farms; it's always a factor in large farms.
"They treat it on a large scale and have a large-scale problem with seed. They're putting (chemicals) in the ground and the consequences are worse than they think."
Growers who sell more than $1,000 of plant products intended for human consumption and use over-the-counter pesticides must get an applicator license, which is good for three years and requires passing an examination.

Gulf of Maine water temperatures increase

Full text: Associated Press
PORTLAND -- The winter's warm air temperatures have helped drive up water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, in line with a continuing trend, and the warm waters could result in lobsters molting their shells earlier than usual and ocean algae blooming ahead of schedule.
In the long run are questions around how rising ocean temperatures might affect the growth and reproduction cycles and distribution of fish and shellfish, whales, zooplankton and other marine life throughout the gulf.
Temperature affects all life processes, but it's too soon to say if changes brought on by rising water temperatures will be good or bad, said Jeffrey Runge, a biological oceanographer at the University of Maine and a researcher at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland.
"Higher temperature means higher growth rates, but it also means they require more food in order to attain those higher growth rates," he said. "But whether there'll be more food around, I don't know."
Gulf of Maine water temperatures have been rising gradually since at least the 1870s, with ups and downs along the way. But the increase has been pronounced in the past decade or so, in the general range of 2 to 5 degrees depending on the ocean depth, Runge said.
The temperature rise in recent years is similar to the 1950s, when the Gulf of Maine warmed up rapidly before falling later, Runge said Thursday in a phone interview from Spain, where he was attending a marine science meeting.
"The question now is whether this is something similar to that warm period in the '50s, or if this is something different, because we have other forces, we have more (carbon dioxide) being put in the air than 50 or 60 years ago," he said. "You can't say what happened in the '50s will happen now, that it'll go down. That's not so clear. Who knows?"
For lobsters, the warmer temperatures could mean they molt their shells and make their annual trek from offshore to nearshore waters earlier in the year. Shrimp could hatch their eggs earlier in the winter. In time, cod and other fish could migrate to the eastern part of the gulf -- or out of the gulf altogether -- in search of colder waters.
If the waters keep heating up, some scientists speculate that a plankton species, Calanus finmarchicus, that is a key prey for herring, mackerel, right whales and other forage species, could diminish or even disappear from the Gulf of Maine.
And there are questions on ripple effects. For instance, warm water could result in shrimp eggs hatching earlier than in the past. But the hatching dates could come before the phytoplankton bloom that shrimp larvae feed upon.
"These are all angles that you'd need to look into to determine what the effects are going to be," said Dave Townsend, an oceanographer at the University of Maine.
Air temperatures in Portland have been well above normal for seven consecutive months, and last week's regional warm spell shattered temperature records across the state for days in a row. Those warm temperatures can also be found in the ocean.
Last Friday, at the tail end of a warm streak, the surface water at a buoy in Casco Bay near Portland came in at 45.5 degrees, or roughly 6 to 10 degrees higher than the same date in any of the past 10 years. At another buoy in Penobscot Bay, off the state's midcoast, the water temperature was 3 to 9 degrees warmer than readings in the past decade.
The Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal and Observing Systems monitors a series of buoys throughout the Gulf of Maine, which stretches from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia. The association collects data on water and air temperatures, wind speed and direction, wave height, and salinity levels.
Water temperatures have been increasing in recent years at all buoys and at all water depths, said Ru Morrison, executive director of NERACOOS, based in Rye, N.H.
"It's warming everywhere, at slightly different rates," he said.

Full text: This year marks my 30th year at writing stories for a newspaper, 25 of them for this company. It had a different name when I started. I can't remember what it was, and it's changed hands a number of times since.
I've had more editors than I can remember. Editors seem to come and go and still I'm here. Where do they go, I wonder? I've asked the ones still around, and they don't seem to know. They just went to other papers, I suppose. I can't remember their names, and I'm sure they can't remember me. They passed by me like smoke every day I was there.
The one I've got now wasn't born when I started writing, but he seems to like me and is good at correcting my errors without wagging his finger at me.
Probably most of the others really wanted to be writers and became disenchanted and took up other lines of work. They might have gone to medical school and have become brain surgeons. Twenty-five years is a long time. You can become a pretty good brain surgeon in that time. It's possible.
It's important for a writer to have had many jobs in life. Zane Grey, who was probably the greatest Western writer of all time, was once a dentist. He sold his first book at the age of 40 and was able to give up drilling teeth.
The great Langston Hughes worked as a busboy in a hotel, Jack London was an oyster pirate, whatever that is; and Harper Lee, who wrote "To Kill a Mockingbird," was an airline ticket agent. Kurt Vonnegut sold cars, and J.K. Rowling taught English as a foreign language before Harry appeared to her.
I guess that bodes well for my future, limited as it is. Because I loved clothes and had no money, I had more after school jobs than anyone in my family, and I had no experience to bring to any of them. I dressed windows and display centers, setting up furniture displays in department stores.
My favorite brother, a cop, got me a job as a police clerk for the St. Louis Police Department, where I watched the human comedy and tragedy of life unfold. There, one night, I checked in a high school friend whose throat had been cut. He lived. I watched cops try to save the life of a small boy who swallowed a lollipop. They failed. Cops tell great stories. I can't remember their names, but I remember those stories.
I had a paper box and route when I was eleven, and had a lot of fun as a copy boy for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, in a newsroom full of smoke from cigarettes, pipes and cigars and the familiar smell of whiskey.
I freelanced for the Los Angeles Times, where a guard checked you for weapons before entering the building. After high school when my future was a blank piece of paper, I made plastic feet in a shoe factory, where I had lunch each day out of a brown paper bag on a loading dock with old men who told me hundreds of stories about the Great Depression and "The Great War." I can't remember their faces, but I remember the stories.
My other brother got me a job as a fireman on a diesel engine. That's the easiest job in the world. You simply sit looking out the window and try to keep people from walking into the train. The engineer was a happy drunk who knew all the words to just one song, "Don't Get Around Much Anymore," and finished an entire bottle on the run from Waukegan, Ill., to Gary, Ind., at full throttle.
I've been a reservation clerk at the Waldorf Astoria in New York and a date for debutantes who couldn't get one for the ball.
Now, near the end of my sidewalk, I'm a cook and live-in housekeeper for a famous teacher. It's almost easier than keeping people from walking into trains.

Full text: Maine Sunday Telegram
FREEPORT -- On a recent weekend, there were few hikers on the trails that wind through a pine forest at Wolfe's Neck Woods State Park before opening up to views of seabird nesting islands and mud flats.
Out on the flats, Sanford Metayer was easy to make out, all alone among the rising seagulls, raking for clams.
As birds scooped up shellfish to hoist into the air, drop and crack on nearby rocks, Metayer collected his own bucket of steamers, feeling lucky to live in Maine. He came to Wolfe's Neck park as a volunteer outdoor educator last Sunday to extend that message to park visitors.
"A lot of people think it's too cold to be digging for clams now," said Metayer of Lewiston, in a deep, gravely voice. "They're like, 'No, I'll go get my clams at the store.' But I like being out here, hearing the seagulls, the tide. This is my enjoyment. I love the smell of the ocean."
Metayer is a recreational clammer, lover of this outdoor playground, and a faithful volunteer at the coastal state park. His favorite activity also is a fine example of the hands-on programs state parks are offering this winter to get more Mainers outside.
Over the next three months, more special events will be held and new activities and programs rolled out at the parks, said Gary Best, Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands interpretive specialist.
"We want to get more people outdoors during winter, get them to our state parks, so we've provided more opportunities to do things across the state," Best said.
To start off, the four-year-old Winter Family Fun Days will offer activities at five parks.
For example, at Mount Blue State Park in Weld, where one of the most elaborate Winter Fun Days takes place, park staff will offer skating instruction, a monstrous sledding run, ice caves and lessons in winter camping.
The Bureau of Parks and Lands will bring a new trailer full of 60 sets of cross country skis, all free to try, to parks across the state, compliments of a $4,900 Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund grant.
It's about the idea that if you build it or bring it, they'll come.
"At all the events we try to identify barriers that are keeping people from getting outside in the winter and trying new things," Best said. "We want to break down those barriers. If one is equipment, we have cross country skis, snowshoes and ice traps. We want to make it easy to come out and try something new."
"First Day Hikes" on New Year's Day will be offered for the first time at four parks: Wolfe's Neck Woods, Popham Beach, Cobscook Bay and Aroostook state parks.
The events are cheap. After the cost of park admission -- $1.50 for those ages 12 to 64 -- everything is free. And the groomed cross country ski trails and skating ponds at the parks are not just available at the winter fun days, but all winter long, Best said.
Wolfe's Neck Woods already promotes winter fun better than most parks.
Wolfe's Neck Woods has always held year-round nature programs. Land for the park was donated to the state in 1969, along with an endowment to fund environmental education.
With the park's 40th anniversary coming up in 2012, park manager Andy Hutchinson said he plans to add programs and teach more outdoor skills this winter. The park will have a fleet of snowshoes to rent for the first time this year.
Over the past six years, Metayer's clamming demonstrations have been observed by as many as 20 and 30 visitors. He offers the seminar for a couple of reasons.
For one, his family loves steamers. Second, clamming at state parks is free. So long as park visitors follow state clamming regulations, they are welcome to dig for the tasty mollusks and collect dinner, same as at Cobscook Bay State Park or Lemoine or Popham Beach state parks.
"Although ours are sweeter," Hutchinson said with a smile.
More of these opportunities are being offered as park managers entice Mainers to play outdoors during the cold months.
"Sanford is but one of the volunteers we bring in. He teaches the hints, how to dig quicker and better," Hutchinson said. "I do the national history piece, how the park has shell middens, how the Native Americans used it as a survival food in March after ice out. The shells with the purple mark were used by the Wabanaki people for trading. It's still a valuable natural resource in Maine."

UNITY -- When life gives people lemons, some make lemonade.
When life gives Clem Blakney sour grapes, or Prairie Star, Niagara, La Crosse, Mars or Reliance grapes, he makes wine.
Blakney owns and operates Younity Winery & Vineyards on Albion Road. He and his wife, Jeri established the vineyards in May 2007 and registered Unity Winery in 2009.
Soon after, they were notified that a winery in California had trademarked the word "Unity."
"We took what could be considered a bad situation and turned it into an opportunity," Blakney said. "Do not let adversity set you back."
Blakney, who enjoys plays on words, said he considers "you," or each individual customer, to be the "Maine ingredient" in his wine. So he tweaked the name of the business to Younity Winery & Vineyards.
The couple enjoy coining catchy names for their wines, all of which are made with Maine grapes and other Maine fruits.
For instance, their cranberry wine, which is pale pink, bubbly and slightly sweet, is called Tickled Pink.
The rhubarb wine, a semi-dry white, is named Rhuby Slippers.
Star Crossed, a dry white wine, is made by combining Prairie Star grapes with Lacrosse grapes.
Somethin' Blue, a full wine made from wild blueberries, has an apt name to be served at weddings.
The Palmer Sisters, a spicy, complicated elderberry wine aged with oak chips, is named for Clem Blakney's grandfather's sisters.
And, Over A Barrel, which has a fruity, slightly sweet taste, is made with Niagara green grapes.
Blakney envisions a nonalcoholic homage to John Wayne made from grape juice called John Wyne.
Connie Bellet, an artist living in Palermo, designs delightfully themed labels around the Blakneys' creative names and concepts.
Her label for Tickled Pink features an ecstatic dancing pink hippopotamus wearing a tutu.
She imagined green rhubarb leaves in the shape of elegant footwear for Rhuby Slippers.
For the Star Crossed wine, Bellet created a Romeo-and-Juliet-style scene with a male suitor standing below a balcony on which his lover stands. Grapevines frame the balcony and above the star-crossed lovers, a night sky is alive with twinkling stars and a moon with a man in it.
Blakney described the Palmer Sisters, who all lived to ripe old ages, as spinster teetotalers. Bellet's label shows three women wearing hats seated at a table. A fourth, who is standing, clutches a bottle of wine behind her back.
On the Over A Barrel label, a hand holding a wine glass sticks out of a small hole in a wooden barrel as it plunges over a steep waterfall.
The designer labels have been so popular, Blakney said, that guests at wine tastings want to purchase the artwork on posters.
Blakney, 60, learned about making wine from his father in Washington state.
After he moved to Maine a few years ago, his hobby turned into a business venture.
Each of the 1,200 vines in the vineyard stretching alongside Albion Road, produces about 10 pounds of grapes. "The yield increases every year," he said.
Someday, Blakney said, each vine might produce 20 pounds of fruit.
Maine's grape-growing season runs from June to September and Blakney said vines can climb six to eight feet each season.
Grapes and vines are like children, he is fond of saying.
"Every one has a personality," said Blakney, who sings to grapes while he prunes vines.
"If you let them go wild, you pay for it," he said. "You have to nourish and guide them and they'll grow up rewarding you."
Blakney said the entire process is satisfying -- from planting vines to sipping wine with guests in his cozy tasting room, which contains a small wooden bar, stained glass lights, and a view of the vineyard.
"I want to get people enthusiastic about wine," he said. "The more wineries, the better it is."
People will appreciate Maine wineries even more, he said, if there is a whole bunch. "You see one grape, you say, 'What's wrong with that?' You see a cluster and you say, Wow!'"
Younity Winery & Vineyards is one of 15 members of The Maine Winery Guild dotting The Maine Wine Trail, which winds from Prospect Hill Winery in Lebanon to Dragonfly Winery in Stetson, to Shalom Organic Orchard Farm & Winery in Franklin, to Oyster River Winegrowers in Thomaston.
Guild members open their vineyards and tasting rooms to the public.
Next to Blakney's tasting room, in the basement of the home, wine ages in two 120-gallon barrels.
Blakney said each barrel, which is covered in homemade cheesecloth, produces about 500 bottles of wine.
"Never judge a wine on the first taste," he said. "The first wakes up your taste buds; the second taste is the true flavor."
And if a batch of wine doesn't turn out as he wished, well, that's part of life.
"Do not be afraid you might get your toes stepped on," he said. "If you don't stick your feet out, you never move forward."
Wise words from a man who is barefoot most of the time.
"I like to feel the earth with my feet," he said, explaining that as a child, to save his shoes from getting scuffed on gravel roads, he walked with his shoes slung over his shoulder.
Mistakes, said the self-described barefoot vintner, are opportunities to learn. And Blakney rather relishes them.
When a batch of Somethin' Blue didn't taste quite right for wine, it became a tasty, tangy spread for crackers -- BB's Maine Blueberry Sting.
"Beware of a wicked sting" reads a warning on the label, which instructs users to shake, open and devour.
Blakney said his tasting room will likely be open for a couple of weekends before Christmas, then he will hibernate and remodel until spring.
Calling ahead is recommended for those interested in a weekend wine-tasting, conversation and a walk with Blakney through the vineyard.
Those who get his answering machine will hear his cheerful voice say, "Drop in, we can talk. And certainly we can drink."

PORTLAND, Maine -- The tropical storms that drenched the Northeast this year left an unexpected bounty: Thousands of mushrooms have sprung up on some lawns, and foragers have filled bags with wild ones plucked from the earth, stumps and logs.
"It was like a scene from 'Alice and Wonderland,"' said David Fischer, who wrote "Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America."
The mushrooms are providing good meals for people like Margaret Primack of Newton, Mass., who collected 60 to 70 pounds this summer. But because some mushrooms are poisonous, they also present a danger for people who can't tell the difference between the tasty and the toxic.
The Northern New England Poison Center has seen an increase in mushroom poisoning cases in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, with 97 in August and September, nearly double the figure from the same time last year.
"People need to have respect for mushrooms," said Karen Simone, the poison center's director. "They don't understand that this can be dangerous."
Different mushrooms types can look similar, and it takes a trained eye to tell the difference between those that are safe and those that are deadly. Mushroom and health experts discourage people from eating wild mushrooms unless they're absolutely sure they're safe.
"If somebody eats the wrong thing, they could be dead, and it's not a fun way to go," said Fischer, who also runs a website dedicated to wild mushrooms from his home in Syracuse, N.Y.
Consumers who are worried about safety can buy mushrooms from the nation's commercial growers, who produce the white button mushrooms commonly used on salads and pizzas, along with shiitake, Portobello and oyster mushrooms.
Commercial mushroom production also is up, topping $1 billion for the first time in the 2010-11 growing season, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's an 8 percent increase from the previous year. Pennsylvania is the leading mushroom state, producing more than half of the nation's commercial crop.
Mushrooms thrive in wet weather and there's been no shortage in the Northeast. Most of the region had more rain than usual in August and September, with cities like Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia setting two-month records. Almost 30 inches of rain were recorded in New York's Central Park during that time.
The downpour didn't help spring mushrooms like morels, but it boosted other species like black trumpets, chanterelles and hen-of-the-woods, which can weigh 20 to 30 pounds each. Hundreds of common mushrooms, and sometimes more, appeared on lawns and golf courses.
"This has been a special year. Some people say it's the best that they've ever seen," said Cynthia Kowal, a senior research administrator at Boston University, member of the Boston Mycological Society and amateur forager who collects mushrooms in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
Mycology is the study of fungi. Both amateur and professional mycologists tend to be a passionate group, photographing and documenting mushrooms, sharing and identifying them and discussing them in online forums.
This year, the volume and variety of mushrooms has given them plenty to talk about. There are lobster mushrooms, so-called because of their red color; shaggy manes, an edible lawn mushroom; stinkhorn mushrooms, which emit an unpleasant odor; and chanterelles, prized among epicureans.
Candice Heydon, a mushroom grower and broker in Maine, said she has had to turn away amateur pickers and foragers who've shown up at her door with bags of mushrooms, hoping to make some extra money.
Even some professional foragers have been overwhelmed.
"They're looking for one kind they're going to get paid for. When they see so many, they're distracted," said Heydon, who owns Oyster Creek Mushroom Co. in Damariscotta.
David Spahr, who collects and studies mushrooms, said the volume of black trumpets is the biggest he's seen in 40 years of foraging.
"That gets people excited because black trumpets are the best-tasting mushrooms in the woods," he said from his home in Washington, Maine.
Spahr cautioned that it's not just rain that's responsible for the widespread fungi this summer and fall. Mushrooms are a bit of a mystery and are not well understood, he said, and even experts don't fully understand why some years are better than others.
That's no concern for Primack, a middle school teacher, and her husband, Richard. They're just grateful for the bounty they're enjoying this year.
"People normally add mushrooms as a garnish for dishes. This year they're so abundant that we have whole large bowls of mushrooms for dinner," said Richard Primack, a biology professor at Boston University. "Our freezer is filled with mushrooms. We're having difficulty finding space for the ice cream."

WATERVILLE -- In real estate, it's all about location.
In the world of edible, wild-mushroom gathering, it's all about timing.
"Timing, timing, timing," mushroom hobbyist and presenter Richard Tory of Canaan told a group of more than 100 people Sunday during an open-air workshop at the Quarry Road Recreation Area. "The seasons; what time of year to look for them -- right after a rain. Not too cold, not too hot, not too dry. The right amount of water."
Sunday's workshop and self-guided mushroom tour of the trails and woods surrounding the recreation area were sponsored by Kennebec Messalonskee Trails.
Foraging, identifying and preparing fungi for the table also is about safety, said Tory, a vegetarian for the past 40 years.
"People need to make sure they identify very carefully what they eat," he said displaying a series of local mushrooms that are good -- and safe -- to eat. "Poisoning cases at hospitals in Maine are up this year. You have to be very careful; you have to really learn how to identify species and try to avoid the other ones.
"Be observant, curious and patient. There are old mushroom hunters and there are bold mushroom hunters, but there are no old, bold mushroom hunters."
The first rule of foraging fearlessly for fungi is to buy and use a good field guide, to learn where the safe, "choice" ones grow and when they grow, Tory said. He recommends learning the identity of the top 10 varieties that grow in central Maine.
There is the oyster mushroom, the chicken mushroom and hedgehog mushroom. There are shaggy manes, bear's head tooth, black trumpet and wine cap, he said of some of the mushrooms that flourish in Maine this time of year, especially after a wet summer.
Some of the tips shared by Tory Sunday included avoiding "little brown mushrooms" and "little white mushrooms." Use only firm and "non-buggy" specimens, he said. Usually mushrooms without "gills" are the safest to eat, he said.
Tory told enthusiasts Sunday to make sure they cook the mushrooms, to eat them in moderation and to be careful of alcohol consumption while eating mushrooms.
Fred Murphy of Waterville was among the many visitors to the workshop who were anxious to learn more about the tasty, wild treat.
"I'm interested in understanding mushrooms," Murphy said. "I want to know what ones I might be safe in picking out back of my house because I own a wood lot that might have some in it."
Murphy said he wanted to take a piece of the bear's head tooth mushroom to try to "inoculate" the trees on his land with the spores from the sample.
Heather Tompkins of Waterville said she had not actually tasted the mushroom selections being circulated through the crowd Sunday, but said she wanted to know more.
"We see mushrooms all over the place and wanted to get a sense of what they are," she said. "I've never really looked into it before, so I wouldn't feel quite ready to eat them. I'm thinking of getting a field guide for them."
Workshop attendee Steve Frederick of Norridgewock said that with recent interest in eating locally and the general state of the economy, he and others may have to look to the woods more for food -- like mushrooms.
"I pick mushrooms, but I wanted to identify more," he said.
"For every one I pick, there's probably 10 varieties that I don't know if they're good or not. I think this is very informative. I'm glad I came."

AUGUSTA -- A highly anticipated report on the state Department of Marine Resources offers plenty of recommendations but few revelations.
In light of the abrupt resignation of Norman Olsen as Gov. Paul LePage's marine resources commissioner in July, there was speculation that the independent audit would contain sharp criticism of the department or shed further light on the circumstances surrounding Olsen's departure.
Ultimately, the 90-page document drafted by three out-of-state experts picked by Olsen cited several concerns that have been topics of discussion in Maine's fishing industry in recent years:
* Criticism of the Department of Marine Resources' structure and effectiveness.
* Skepticism about the sustainability of recent record-breaking lobster harvests.
* Concern that the already cash-strapped department will have fewer resources in the near future.
Insiders in the industry apparently did not spend their weekend reading the report, which was released Friday.
Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, said she's looking forward to reviewing it, "however, I have not yet received a copy."
LePage's press office issued a news release Friday afternoon containing a link to the report, which is on the Department of Marine Resources' website.
Rep. Windol Weaver, R-York, House chairman of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee, said Monday that he was just beginning to review the report.
Others contacted Monday for their thoughts on the report declined to comment because they hadn't looked it over.
Despite the report's low profile so far, Weaver predicted that it will be the focus of much of his committee's work during the legislative session that starts in January.
"I guess it's good advice and an outside evaluation that the department's probably needed for many years," he said, "so it gives us a good starting point."
The audit was done by David Wallace, who has owned seafood processing companies and fishing boats in his 45 years in the industry; W. "Pete" Jensen, whose career in natural resources management includes work with the National Marine Fisheries Service; and David Borden, who has been in fisheries management for 38 years, according to the report.
The review contains more than three dozen recommendations, ranging from staffing and fiscal matters to fishery management, lobster processing and aquaculture.
It says, "The department should be restructured and activities prioritized around a strong legislative policy requiring sustainable resource management based on management plans with clear objectives and goals."
It also says that, based on interviews with dozens of department staffers and lawmakers, "one particular concern was that the continued increase in the harvest of lobsters that is largely unexplained may not be sustainable but there were no efforts underway to constrain the harvest to an identified sustainable level."
Maine lobster landings averaged about 20 million pounds a year from 1950 to 1990, according to the report. More than 94 million pounds were landed in 2010.
The number of lobster traps increased from 430,000 in 1950 to 2.6 million in 1996. Now, there are more than 3 million traps for 5,977 lobstermen, according to the report.
The audit says that because it is not clear why the yield has been so plentiful in recent years it would be "prudent to initiate a process to slowly transition the industry away from several practices that we view as undesirable and/or damaging in order to promote the long-term viability of stock and industry."
The authors recommend that the state gradually reduce the number of traps "in a very predictable and transparent way."
Weaver, the lawmaker from York, said he doesn't believe that lobsters are being overfished but he agrees that the industry likely faces changes.
"We're going to look at that (number of traps) because we've got to do something about it, but also we're having a problem with letting new people into the industry," he said, because entry is now restricted.
He agreed with the report's evaluation that the Department of Marine Resources - in charge of one of Maine's most lucrative industries -- is running on a shoestring budget and is likely to get less federal money.
"It's getting very tough and we're looking for more money, but you know the state doesn't have it, the federal government doesn't have it. The options are to increase license fees," he said, acknowledging that doing so would upset fishermen.
"You try and work with them and see what you can do, but sometimes you may have to do something that's not pleasant, and I hope we don't, but it's getting serious, as indicated by this report," Weaver said.
On the upside, the report highlights potential for expanding the industry for shellfish processing and expanding aquaculture opportunities by streamlining government permitting.
Adrienne Bennett, spokeswoman for LePage, said Monday that the administration is not prepared to discuss plans for following up on the report's recommendations until specific legislation is drafted.

DEP: Dredging didn't hurt river

BATH -- The Army Corps of Engineers' dredging of the Kennebec River is complete, and Bath Iron Works launched its latest destroyer by the Navy's Sept. 1 deadline. However, concerns about the future effect of the off-season project on juvenile lobster and clams persist among harvesters, environmentalists and residents.
Officials at the Maine Department of Environmental Protection said no significant harm was caused, and the Sept. 1 departure of the USS Spruance was a success on more than one front.
The Navy ship made safe passage down the Kennebec River on its maiden voyage, the summer catch was left unharmed by the Army Corps of Engineers project, and state marine officials reported there were no documented takes of endangered salmon or sturgeon.
In order to ensure the warship's safe passage, the corps dredged sand that had built up near Doubling Point and at the mouth of the river, and it dumped the material in an area of the river north of Bluff Head, known as The Narrows, and by Jackknife Ledge near Popham Beach.
The dredging was completed Aug. 14.
The project got a lot of public attention because it was done at the height of fishing and tourism season, unlike in previous years.
According to a report from the corps, "Steps were taken to minimize potential adverse impacts of the discharge on the aquatic ecosystem."
DEP spokeswoman Samantha DePoy-Warren said clam flats remained open after the dredging project on Aug. 18; and after the Corps dumped the dredging material by Jackknife Ledge, lobstermen hauled in traps to find lobsters inside.
As far as the endangered species observer aboard the dredging ship could tell, no endangered fish were killed during the process, DePoy-Warren said.
The question of how the dredging and dumping affected juvenile marine life will have to wait longer for an answer.
There were fears that the dredging might have stirred up fecal matter carried by the river from soil erosion, rain and antiquated septic systems and farms. The state Department of Marine Resources tested for fecal contamination at 11 additional sites along the river before and after the dredging project, and tests came back clean. The river remains open to clam digging.
Before the project started, the corps was required to have a suitability determination test to show the elements that were to be dredged up.
Bob Greene, project manager for the DEP, said the department determined 98 percent of the material was sand and that contaminants would adhere to other sediments, but not sand.
As a result of the finding, Greene and his staff determined that any additional testing for metals and other contaminants was not merited.
The Department of Marine Resources doesn't test for metals and other contaminants settled into the river bottom, either, according to Fran Pierce, who monitors water quality in shellfish growing areas for the department.
Pierce said they also don't have a way to test the effects of the dredging on juvenile clams and lobsters, the results of which local harvesters have said would not be realized for three or four years after dredging.
"Even at that point, how could you definitely say whether it was caused by the dredging?" Pierce said.
Tests need to be taken in advance of dredging to establish a baseline, and then tests would need to be taken years after.
"It would be a pretty involved study," Pierce said. "We just don't have the staff."
A small staff working for DMR monitors the entire ragged Maine coastline -- about 3,500 miles -- to measure shellfish health.
Greene said they did not measure the effect of the dredging on juvenile lobsters and clams for the Spruance dredging.
He did not think dumping material at Jackknife Ledge, which many local lobstermen view as a prime summer lobster fishery, would harm young lobsters. He also said they relied heavily on previous projects and information gleaned from local lobstermen.
Greene said lobsters would not migrate out of a dumping area permanently; they just get out of the way of the disturbance area, then return to the same spot over time.
"That is what I've been told by people who have been involved in the lobster industry," Greene said.
In recent years, shellfish harvesters have become increasingly involved in the health and sustainability of clam flats. When the state and clam diggers clashed about a series of flat closures, it sparked awareness of the need to monitor pollution levels and reseed flats.
"There's much more interest at the local level and many parties are involved," Pierce said. "It's really great. The public is much more aware."
Regarding the effect of dredging silt on clam spat -- juvenile clams planted by local diggers for future harvests -- Greene was less sure.
"I don't think anybody knows," he said.
However, he said there was little concern. Of the material dredged, about 2 percent of it was silt, Greene said.
Two percent of 50 yards over the vast acreage of clam flats would total about 0.016 inches of silt thickness, Greene said. That amount of silty material would not cover evenly, nor remain in one place for any length of time.
"We made the determination there wouldn't be an unreasonable impact on the clam flats. From a physical perspective, there was just not enough silt to cover the spat," Greene said.
He said it would be difficult to develop the methodology to measure the specific impacts of silt on clam flats.
"There are a lot of mitigating circumstances why we haven't done post-dredging monitoring," he said. He added that his department doesn't have enough data to indicate what the silty material's effect would be to warrant a study.
"Yes, there's going to be an impact, but not enough to warrant the staff or the cost."

PORTLAND -- A Japanese delegation from the Aomori Prefecture will make a five-day visit to Portland, Augusta and four other communities next week to exchange ideas on alternative energy, business and aquaculture.
The delegation includes government officials, business leaders and university faculty members from a Japanese energy think tank.
The visit, from Sept. 6-10, will include stops at the Gulf of Maine Research Center in Portland, as well as presentations at the Maine International Trade Center, the University of Maine's Offshore Wind Laboratory, the Maine Aquaculture Association and the Maine Shellfish Growers.
The visit was organized by the Maine-Aomori Sister State Advisory Council.
"(The council's) mission is to identify and assess existing activities and exchanges with Aomori and devise strategies to develop cultural, educational and commercial opportunities between the sister states," said Stephen MacDougall, the council's chairman, in a press release. "This visit, with its very timely focus on energy and the fishery and food products industries, will strengthen and expand the Maine-Aomori partnership and quite possibly reveal the potential for joint research and development programs."
Maine's relationship with the Aomori Prefecture dates to 1889, when the 1,500-ton ship Cheseborough, sailing from Bath, wrecked off the coast of Aomori.
Residents from the village of Shariki rescued four survivors and buried the people who died, including Peter Erickson, the captain.
Amid the wreckage that drifted ashore, the people of Shariki discovered Maine pears, and enjoyed them so much that they planted pear trees of their own.
Every year, the people of Shariki hold a service for the sailors who lost their lives on that night in 1889 and leave pears on the graves of those who died.

Full text: Correspondent
PHIPPSBURG -- The Army Corps of Engineers finished dredging a portion of the Kennebec River on Aug. 14, in time for the Navy to receive Bath Iron Works' newly built destroyer, the DDG 111 Spruance.
But some residents are concerned about the project's impact on marine life.
While the disturbance of silt caused some immediate problems for local fishermen and clammers, long-term effects are uncertain.
Laura Sewall, director of Bates Morse Mountain conservation area and a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Corps, said she saw an unusual spread of dead quahogs washed ashore in the days immediately after the project's completion.
"It was like a trap door had opened up," she said, describing what she said were hundreds of dead quahog shells scattered across the beach Tuesday. "It was like pulses of dead quahogs. It was so visible. People have said we have seen this before, but it was always after a big storm."
But with each passing day, the shells were picked clean by birds and the waves spread them farther apart.
Phippsburg Shellfish Committee chairman Dean Doyle describes the silt washing ashore as a fine, light brown substance.
The Shellfish Committee joined the town of Phippsburg, the Shellfish Conservation Commission, the Phippsburg Land Trust, the Kennebec Estuary Land Trust, Friends of Merrymeeting Bay, residents and others in a legal appeal of a Maine Department of Environmental Protection decision that allowed the out-of-season dredging to occur.
The Corps dredged approximately 70,000 cubic yards of sand near the area of Doubling Point and at the mouth of the Kennebec near Popham Beach.
They dumped the sand in two sites: One just north of Bluff Head, in a portion of the Kennebec known as the Narrows; the other at a spot about a half mile south of Jackknife Ledge.
In their complaint filed with the First District Court in Portland, plaintiffs asked that the court direct the Corps to dredge and dump the river-bottom material using the least environmentally damaging alternative. The complaint included a request to wait to do advanced dredging until off season, or else dredging the minimal amount needed for safe passage of the Spruance down the Kennebec.
Was it enough?
John Libby, a small-business owner and shellfish harvester who sells seafood and produce from his Phippsburg home, is upset by the dredging and thinks it may need to occur again.
"I'm sick and tired about hearing them dumping all the dredging material into a 125-foot hole in the Kennebec, but when they come back five years later, it's still 125 feet deep," Libby said. "It tells you, you need to take that sand out into the ocean and dump it. Yes, it's going to cost more initially, but it's going to save money in the long run. It's just ridiculous."
Ed O'Donnell, navigation chief for the Army Corps of Engineers New England District, said he did not think tidal currents would fill in where they dredged.
Still, he said a lot of material had moved from where they had surveyed from May this year to a pre-dredge survey in late July.
"This river is really unpredictable," he said. "Things changed pretty quickly."
O'Donnell said upriver activity meant they felt they needed to do advanced maintenance dredging, which is additional dredging of sand.
He said that was more cost effective, since getting the equipment onto the river is expensive and they were able to get more done over the course of one project.
He said the Corps didn't take any extraordinary measures to minimize the impact, but that the dredging ship had an endangered species observer on board.
"We didn't see any takes of endangered species," O'Donnell said.
Dave Percy, a lobsterman who sets and hauls his traps by Jackknife Ledge, said he hadn't seen any takes, either. But he said he was surprised to see the dredging ship dump all the material in few spots.
"They just dropped it, boatloads," he said as he unpacked crates of lobsters from the back of his pickup on a West Point dock last week. "I was thinking they'd shoot it out little by little."
Percy said he could not say for sure whether smaller lobsters were affected by the sand dumping.
"I highly doubt they (the lobsters) could get out of the way," he said. "That's why everybody wanted them (Army Corps) to go further out (to dump)."
In addition to the concern about dumping in what many have described as a prime lobster fishery, there's some concern over how the dredging will affect clam flats.
Doyle said he has taken water samples and conducted tests for fecal pollution at 20 clam flat sites along the Kennebec River -- from Fort Popham to the South End Launch in Bath, during and after the dredging.
"There was a lot of stuff stirred up," he said, without elaborating.
Dot Kelly, a member of the Phippsburg Land Trust, stuck rods in the flats at low tide before the dredging began, to mark, in 10-centimeter intervals, any accumulation of silt.
She said the rods did not show how much silt had accumulated on the flats, and that it is difficult for citizen scientists to quickly determine the potential damage an August dredging project would have on marine life.
"It's not something that happens overnight," she said.
But she questioned the timing. "The Army Corps of Engineers even said August is the worst month for this."
"Is it really going to extend to the next time they need to dredge?" she said. "When the river needs to be dredged again, we need to be collaborative."
Kelly was referring to the hope that many residents, shellfish harvesters, lobstermen, business owners and town officials have for open communication between the Navy, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies to get the necessary work accomplished with the least negative impact.
Several days after the project, clam diggers began seeing signs of clams, but many said they were not sure if the lack of holes immediately following the dredging were from the warm August weather or from the disturbance from the dredging process.
Affect on clams
August is high season for fishing and tourism on the Maine coast, when clam diggers make $130 per bushel, the highest price paid for clams all year.
A significant concern among residents is an accumulation of dredging silt on the spat, the baby clams harvesters planted in spring. Throughout the summer, the spat float freely in the water and then toward summer's end, they settle into the mud.
Local clam harvester Terry Watson said he remembers a test that was taken several years ago, during the time of another Kennebec River dredging project, which sought to measure the accumulation of silt on the clam flats. He alleged that after the project, harvesters lost two years' worth of clams as a result of smothering sediment.
Watson said he did not see significant layering of sediment this year.
While some residents argue the effects of the dredging are not as easy to see, any sediment of sand dumped from the dredging process on the flats could suffocate the clam spat.
Clam spat is tiny, smaller in circumference than a fingernail, with necks that can't stretch beyond half of an inch. Larger clams are found deeper in the mud, since they have longer necks that can reach the surface.
"I wouldn't be able to say whether (the dredging) affected the seed," Doyle said. "It takes two to three years for them to mature."
Doyle said his father still works at Bath Iron Works, as do many members of his family.
As one of several plaintiffs against the Army Corps of Engineers, Doyle emphasized one point he said he has stressed all along: They weren't interested in stopping the ship's passage down the Kennebec, but were asking for the least amount of damage be done to the river.
"There's more in the Kennebec than that shipyard," Doyle said. "It would be better if they would just work with the fishermen. There are plenty of other ways to do it.
"We don't want to see (BIW) be impacted at all," he said. "But it would be nice if we could sit down and work on something that could work out for everybody."

The Portland Press Herald
SCARBOROUGH -- Standing on his pontoon work station, Nate Perry scooped young inch-and-a-half-long oysters into plastic mesh bags. Good weather meant an opportunity to deploy some floating bags and get the shellfish on the way to market size.
By this time of year, nearly all the bags have been set out. The warm waters of the Scarborough River will encourage the oysters to pump and take in nutrients after their winter hibernation. When they reach cocktail size -- 3 inches -- Perry, a one-man operation, will be able to harvest them and sell them to markets and restaurants hungry for Maine oysters.
Perry and Abigail Carroll, another fledgling farmer, are among the first to try oyster aquaculture in the Scarborough River. The location, with its tidal currents and particular nutrients, creates oysters that they try to describe with such adjectives as briny, sweet, creamy and grassy.
"That's what an oyster is, it's the taste of the sea where it came from," Perry said.
While Carroll sees continued high demand for Maine oysters, she cautions that oyster aquaculture isn't for everyone. The work, she notes, is dirty, hard and very physical.
Carroll and Perry each use bags with foam floats that are connected to lines. The systems vary in the details, and Carroll and her two part-time employees do some of their work on the beach at low tide rather than on a pontoon like Perry does. But each of them will have to flip the bags regularly to dry out the algae that forms on the wet side and root out invaders like starfish and crabs. As the oysters grow, the farmers have to sort them into different bags to provide them more room.
"You've got to really nurture these guys," Carroll said.
It takes about three years to grow oyster seeds -- specks about 2 millimeters big -- to market size. Carroll got a jumpstart with her initial batch by starting with juveniles.
Perry and Carroll each are looking to expand small operations around Nonesuch Point after an initial go under small-scale licenses that limit operations to 400 square feet. Under the new licenses they're seeking, Perry could expand to 1.4 acres and Carroll to 4 acres.
A third license holder, Ernest Heether, began a venture with Carroll before they went their separate ways. Heether, who could not be reached, has renewed his small-scale license with the state.
The expansions planned by Perry and Carroll come at time when aquaculture is becoming the new face of the working waterfront in Maine, said Sebastian Belle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association. The sector is growing as it becomes more difficult to make a living in traditional fishing, whether due to limits on the resources or a lack of available licenses, he said.
Perry, who comes from a lobstering family, also makes his living by teaching music and working at J's Oyster in Portland. (His shucking skills -- he's done about 1,000 in an hour -- once won him a state title.) Carroll is an entrepreneur who got immersed in oyster aquaculture after deciding to investigate the concept and work on a business plan.
Oyster aquaculture in Maine is centered around the Damariscotta River, where research at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center in Walpole and warm water created a hospitable environment. More than 72 percent of last year's harvest -- some 2.96 million oysters -- were from the Damariscotta River.
Interest in oyster aquaculture had been increasing slowly and steadily, said Jon Lewis, aquaculture environmental coordinator at the state Department of Marine Resources. There are about 150 oyster sites in the state, with some businesses operating multiple sites.
In addition to proper temperatures, oysters need areas that are free from fecal coliform contamination. Other considerations include navigation, water flow and other uses of the area.
Both Perry and Carroll are growing American, or Eastern, oysters, which account for nearly all the oysters from Maine. Wellfleets, Blue Points and Pemaquids are all American oysters that come from different locations.
Perry expects to sell his oysters under the name Pine Point Oyster Co. in time for Independence Day, and Carroll has been selling hers as Nonesuch Oysters.
He hopes to sell about 1,000 a week while she hopes to increase production from hundreds a week to thousands.
As a side project, Carroll is also growing Belons, or European flats, the other type of oyster found in Maine. Distinctive in their metallic undertones, Belons are prized in their homeland of France and among connoisseurs. They are also more difficult to grow. Carroll is growing them as part of a research project coordinated by the Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research and Education.
Oysters are a high-value product, with Americans able to fetch 50 or 60 cents apiece on the wholesale market, according to Lewis. That market was worth more than $1.75 million last year.
The strength of Maine's brand is based not just on the state's reputation as a pristine area. There's a biological basis as well, Belle noted.
Water temperatures in Maine are relatively cold, which means that oysters here generally do not spawn. When oysters direct their energies toward reproduction, their glycogen content falls, making them less sweet and plump, Belle said.
Maine oyster farmers cannot grow enough to satisfy demand and it's not uncommon for growers to have to ration the number they provide to each account, Belle said.
"There aren't enough Maine oysters for the world," Carroll said.

Groups sound off against dredging

Popham Beach area fishermen, business owners and others are trying to block the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from dredging the Kennebec River during the height of the summer fishing and tourism season.
While dredging is normally done in winter, the corps is seeking state and federal permits to remove 70,000 cubic yards of silt from two sections of the river in August. The dredge spoils would be deposited downriver in Phippsburg, and offshore near Seguin Island off Popham Beach.
The corps, which is responsible for keeping federal navigation channels open, says the work is necessary to prevent the U.S.S. Spruance, a $1 billion destroyer under construction at Bath Iron Works, from running aground when it leaves in September.
The Navy says speedy delivery of the 510-foot ship is critical to national defense. Opponents say they are seeking a compromise that won't harm the endangered short-nosed sturgeon, Atlantic salmon and other wildlife in the river, or jeopardize the livelihoods of clammers, lobstermen and those involved in the tourist trade.
"They are wiping out the entire bottom habitat, smothering it under a layer of sand. Ecologically, dredging is carpet bombing," said Stephen Hinchman, a West Bath lawyer.
Hinchman represents the town of Phippsburg, the Phippsburg Shellfish Conservation Commission's 40 commercial harvesters, the Phippsburg Land Trust, the Kennebec Estuary Land Trust, Friends of Merrymeeting Bay and several Phippsburg residents who have appealed a conditional permit issued by former state Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Darryl Brown. The appeal is one of four filed in the case.
They will be decided by the Board of Environmental Protection.
Brown issued the permit earlier this year, on the condition that the Legislature reclassify the water quality in sections of the river below BIW where the dredged material will be dumped. The current classification, the highest possible, prohibits the disposal of dredged material.
DEP officials said the sections in question were mistakenly classified at the highest level in the 1990s.
"Our documentation makes it clear to us there was an error," said Susan Davies, water quality standards coordinator at the DEP.
Lawmakers have yet to act on the reclassification, which is included in an omnibus bill proposing changes to DEP rules.
Opponents say they are not against shipbuilding or dredging, but they question why the corps didn't plan better for the project.
"It is frustrating for us because we know they have to do it, and BIW provides a ton of jobs for our families and friends. But why do we have to do all the sucking it up for poor planning?" said Ethan DeBery, a Phippsburg resident who runs a fishing excursion boat and ferry boat to Seguin Island.
Opponents say they are just asking the corps to take less intrusive steps than the full-fledged dredge the agency is proposing -- the firstsince 2003 -- to ensure that the Spruance doesn't run aground.
Hinchman said it is possible the channel can be deepened by using a mechanical bucket dredge rather than the proposed hopper dredge, which vacuums up the material. He said the corps could then come back and do the full dredging in the winter.
Bill Kavanaugh, manager of the dredging project, said the corps cannot afford to dredge twice. He said federal funding for maintenance dredging is declining, especially for projects like this one, that do not involve commercially important ports. The Kennebec dredging will cost about $1.5 million.
"We are not looking to modify our plan," said Kavanaugh.
He disputed opponents' claims that the dredging would hurt fishing or the environment, saying the corps is required to pursue the least costly environmentally suitable alternative available.
"We don't anticipate any flats being closed and any significant impacts as far as fishing and tourism," said Kavanaugh.
He said ongoing dredging off Cape Cod in Massachusetts has benefitted fishing.
"You are dredging up sediments that contain tiny organisms that fish go for," said Kavanaugh.
He said he expects the project to win approval from the National Marine Fisheries Service, which has the authority to stop the work if it threatens endangered species.
Opponents point out that the destroyer went safely down the river for sea trials in March, when a Bath Iron Works pilot successfully navigated the ship outside the designated channel.
Commander Tate Westbrook, a self-described environmentalist and captain of the Spruance and its 275 crew members, said that is a risk he cannot take. He said that in March, with the tides at their highest, the ship barely cleared the bottom.
"We had two feet between the bottom of my ship and the granite edges of the river," said Westbrook.
He said no matter how experienced the pilot, it is impossible to know exactly where the channel is under a destroyer, which is not equipped with a forward depth sounder.
Westbrook said the safety of his crew, many of whom will be going to sea for the first time, is at stake as well as the environment if his ship runs aground and spills the 300,000 gallons of fuel it will be carrying.
Westbrook said due to technical delays the ship is already six months overdue for its nearly year-long trip down the East Coast and through the Panama Canal to its home port of San Diego. Westbrook said the chief of naval operations, Admiral Gary Roughead, has repeatedly told Congress the Navy needs 313 destroyers to meet its current obligations around the world, but is operating with an active fleet of only 286.
"In Navy-speak, the demand for destroyers exceeds the supply," said Westbrook.
Last week, the corps conducted new channel surveys to determine whether spring runoff may have solved the problem by washing out the sand blocking the channel. Although the results are not yet available, Kavanaugh expressed doubt because the snowpack in the Kennebec watershed over the winter was below normal.
Even if the channel has opened up, there is no guarantee it will remain so this summer, when sand at the mouth of the river washes back toward shore and up the river, said Kavanaugh.
Bath Iron Works officials find themselves caught in the middle.
"BIW has no desire to negatively impact the livelihoods of either our Phippsburg neighbors, the 111 BIW employees who reside in Phippsburg or the 5,600 BIW employees who live in communities across the state and make their living building ships for the U.S. Navy," said spokesman Jim DeMartini.
But BIW officials questioned the motives of some of the opponents, such as landowner Dot Kelly, who has applied for a federal permit to place six tidal turbines in the area where the dredge spoils will go.
Kelly said her concerns are strictly about the environmental impact of the project.
"I just want them to go through the legal process for permits," said Kelly.
U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree has met with both Bath Iron Works and the dredging opponents to try to broker a compromise. She said she is concerned about the effects of an August dredge.
"I hope it won't be necessary," said Pingree.
Meanwhile, time is running out, Kavanaugh said.
It is unclear when the Board of Environmental Protection will get to the appeals, including two filed by area residents opposed to the dredging and one by the corps, which is seeking an unconditional permit that would require no legislative action.
The BEP has stopped meeting until its members are vetted for possible conflicts of interest, at the direction of Gov. Paul LePage. The governor instituted the review following the resignation of Brown, the former DEP commissioner, over conflict-of-interest concerns.
Brown resigned after it became apparent that his ownership of an environmental consulting firm could violate conflict-of-interest provisions in state and federal law, making him ineligible for the job.
Hinchman, the lawyer representing dredging critics, played a key role in raising the conflict-of-interest issue with the federal government, state lawmakers and the Maine Attorney General's Office.
Opponents say that even if the Legislature reclassifies water quality in the Kennebec, dredging in the summer still violates standards, and they will continue to fight it.
"You can't ask the people who live and work on the water to be the ones to pay for it. They should have done it last winter," said Hinchman.

State House Bureau
AUGUSTA -- State lawmakers must find $120,000 to maintain funding for three scientists who inspect shellfish beds, which are critical to Maine's $20 million-a-year shellfish industry, Sen. Lois Snowe-Mello, R-Poland, said Tuesday.
"These three positions must be maintained in order to ensure public health and safety, ensure uninterrupted services to the shellfish industry, and protect the Maine shellfish brand and economy," said Snowe-Mello, Senate chairwoman of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee.
Snowe-Mello and other members of the committee told the Appropriations Committee that they agree unanimously with Gov. Paul LePage's proposed marine resources budget, except for the omission of funding for the scientists.
The legislators recommended -- by unanimous, bipartisan vote -- adding money for the positions to the two-year budget that would take effect July 1.
Rep. Patrick Flood, R-Winthrop, House chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said he wants to check with the LePage administration to see "what the wishes are of the governor."
"I don't want to be terribly critical of the executive branch," he said. "A lot of things fall through the cracks, and this may be one of them."
Adrienne Bennett, spokeswoman for LePage, said Tuesday evening that the administration is working with the committee to find a solution.
The Legislature created the positions in 2009, after the state closed shellfish beds from Kittery to Harpswell in response to a determination by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that "Maine was not in compliance with federal requirements," said the Marine Resources Committee's report.
Snowe-Mello and other committee members said the state's shellfish industry must stay in compliance with federal rules so clammers can sell shellfish across state lines. Clammers have been a visible presence at the State House since last week as they have discussed the issue with lawmakers.
"A dirty lobster or a bad clam, and we lose billions of dollars," said Sen. Nancy Sullivan, D-Biddeford. "This needs to work and we have to play ball with the feds."
Lawmakers funded the positions through fees for subsurface wastewater disposal systems, fees paid by public sewage treatment plants, and overboard discharge surcharges.
Those sources haven't produced enough money to support the positions over the long term, said Patrick Keliher, acting deputy commissioner for the Department of Marine Resources. He said funding for the positions will run out in June 2012. The additional $120,000 requested would keep the positions funded through 2016, he said.
Commissioner Darryl Brown of the Department of Environmental Protection said he will examine his budget to look for funding. He said the state should add to the number of people who inspect the shellfish beds.
"These positions are what we need to keep, to maintain a minimum level of performance," he said.

Full text: The Portland Press Herald
This time of year, Maine cities and towns are busily removing towering snowbanks to make roads and sidewalks safe, and trucking the piles to snow dumps.
Under state regulations that protect water quality, the dumps must be away from rivers and streams, partly surrounded by silt barriers and, by June 30, cleared of all the trash that gets left behind when the snow melts.
Now a bill backed by the Maine Municipal Association would let cities and towns dump their snow wherever they want -- including into lakes, rivers and coastal bays -- without permission from the Department of Environmental Protection.
Municipalities that support the measure say snow dump rules cost them money and create their own environmental problems. But some environmental groups say that abolishing the regulations would threaten water supplies, kill fish and contaminate shellfish beds.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Sheryl Briggs, D-Mexico, has created another battle over environmental regulations in the early days of Gov. Paul LePage's administration. The snow dump requirements are on LePage's list of rules that he wants to abolish or weaken to make the state more friendly to businesses and create jobs.
Briggs said she sponsored the bill to review the regulations, not necessarily to abolish them.
"I am not saying it is a good idea, but I am saying the discussion should come forward," said Briggs, who is executive secretary for the town of Mexico.
Briggs' boss, Town Manager John Madigan, is lobbying for the change. He said the rules cost the town money and don't prevent pollution.
Mexico is one of about 10 municipalities in Maine that pay $315 a year to operate snow dumps that do not conform to DEP regulations.
"The bottom line is, we are along the Androscoggin River, and when the snow melts, it is going to get there anyway," said Madigan.
Madigan said the town used to pile the snow it removed from its downtown behind the town hall, which is on the river. Now it hauls the snow to a dump four or five miles away.
The new dump is licensed by the DEP, but the town has to pay the $315 fee because the site is over an aquifer.
Madigan said that moving the snow dump has created its own problems, driving up the cost of transporting the snow and sending more diesel fumes from dump trucks into the air.
He said the snow dump license fee is just one of a number of fees charged to towns by the state, and those costs add up.
"The state keeps taking money away from us, and all we can do is pass it on to property taxpayers," said Madigan.
He said he is skeptical that snow dumps pollute and questions the research on which the regulations are based.
Environmental groups say there is no question that snow dumps pollute and need regulation. Joe Payne, baykeeper for the Friends of Casco Bay, said snow is dirty even before it hits the ground because it washes pollutants from the air as it falls. On the ground, it mixes with oil, dirt, road salt, litter and other material on roadways.
"There are plenty of studies that show how polluted snow is. You dump it into the water, and the pollutants go into the mud. It is one thing that is preventable," said Payne.
Geoff Herman, director of state and federal regulations for the Maine Municipal Association, said the bill was backed by the association's 70-member policy committee. He said clearing roads and sidewalks of snow is a public safety issue, not a pollution issue.
Herman said the bill would help cities and towns that don't own property that is suitable for snow dumps under current regulations.
"It has been a real limitation about where they can put the snow," he said.
Stephen Hinchman, lawyer for the Androscoggin River Alliance, said that if the DEP no longer issues snow dumping permits, any dumps that discharge into waters will violate federal law, and expose cities and towns to lawsuits.
Some municipalities say they welcome the snow dump rules because they protect water supplies.
"I don't think the regulations have been onerous at all," said Mike Bolduc, Saco's public works director.
When Saco's snow dump melts in the spring, he said, it leaves behind a pile of debris that would otherwise go into storm drains and, ultimately, the Saco River.
Portland officials said that even if the snow dump regulations are abolished, the city will keep its controls to minimize the dumps' environmental impacts.
The city piled snow in a vacant lot in the Bayside neighborhood until it got full. Truckloads of snow are going now to a site on outer Congress Street.
"We will continue to be good environmental stewards," said Nicole Clegg, the city's spokeswoman.

Marine committee endorses foreign affairs expert

Full text: State House Bureau
AUGUSTA -- Can someone who has spent much of his career resolving conflicts overseas while working for the U.S. Foreign Service bring peace to Maine's fractious fishing industry?
It appears Maine will soon find out. The Legislature's Marine Resources Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to endorse Norman Olsen to be commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Olsen has worked as an associate coordinator for counterterrorism at the U.S. State Department, a senior adviser to the ambassador to Israel, a political affairs counselor in Israel during the Iraq War, and chief of staff of a team of diplomats in Kosovo that arranged a cease-fire between Serbian and ethnic Albanian forces.
If his nomination is confirmed by the Maine Senate, Olsen will have to handle disputes among groundfishermen, lobstermen, shrimpers, shellfish harvesters, sports fishermen, herring, tuna and alewife fishermen, environmentalists, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council.
Speaking at his confirmation hearing Wednesday, Olsen said he planned to build a sense of "community" among all the sectors of Maine's marine resources industry, explaining that the economic climate of the industry as a whole can improve when sectors cooperate.
"We in the marine resources industry have always thought of everything as a zero-sum game, one in which the extra dollar someone makes somehow comes out of our pocket," he said. "Nothing could be farther from the truth."
Representatives of several fishing sectors praised Olsen at the hearing. They liked his cool-headed diplomatic manner and his personal connections to Maine's fishing industry
Olsen is a fourth-generation fisherman. He grew up in Cape Elizabeth, and his father caught shrimp, whitefish, groundfish and lobsters.
Olsen began fishing for lobsters at age 12 and worked as a lobsterman for two years on his own 32-foot boat after graduating from Colby College with a degree in economics.
He also worked for a national company that harvested and processed surf clams and ocean quahogs.
"That's credibility you can't get any other way," said Tom Valleau, president of the Portland Fish Exchange. "He has the respect of the fishing industry."
One of the most controversial issues facing Olsen is whether lobsters caught as incidental catch in groundfish nets should be legal to sell in Maine ports. Because the practice is banned in Maine, many groundfishermen land their fish in Massachusetts ports, where those lobsters can be sold legally.
A proposal to allow such sales in Maine ports was defeated soundly in 2007 after the powerful lobster industry lobbied hard against it. When asked Wednesday what he thought of the idea, Olsen said he wanted to study the issue before making a decision.
James Odlin, a Portland groundfishermen, said he hopes Olsen's diplomatic skills will allow him to help the struggling groundfishing industry without threatening the livelihoods of lobstermen.
"I am hopeful that the new governor and commissioner can find a way for both fisheries to exist and bring the groundfishing industry back to the state of Maine," Odlin said. "There has to be a way to make that happen."

Long return puts Connolly in spotlight

Full text: FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) -- Dan Connolly took a seat at the bar of the fancy French restaurant where his brother was the chef and started digging in.
One by one, the portions disappeared during that meal three years ago in Boston's financial district.
"I felt like I exhausted my efforts on him, both quantity-wise and creatively, and he still had room," Patrick Connolly recalled. "I would say it was about 12 portions. He's always been a pretty experimental eater. He's open to trying anything, even when we were kids. I served him plenty of raw fish, shellfish, stuff like that."
From his palate to the playing field, versatility is Dan Connolly's strong suit.
He's played left guard, right guard, center, tight end and fullback in just three seasons with the New England Patriots.
And, of course, he returns kicks.
Speeding and swerving despite his 313 pounds, Connolly ran a kickoff back 71 yards in Sunday night's 31-27 win over the Green Bay Packers, the longest by an NFL offensive lineman since at least 1976 when the league started keeping complete records.
Does that worry Buffalo Bills coach Chan Gailey as he prepares for Sunday's game with the Patriots?
"I hope we don't kick it to him, to be honest with you," Gailey said with a laugh.
Patriots coach Bill Belichick wasn't buying it.
"Yeah," he said. "I bet Chan's really worried about that."
It may not be an issue since Connolly could miss the game. A victory over the Bills (4-10) would make the Patriots (12-2) the AFC's top-seeded playoff team, but Connolly sat out the entire second half Sunday night with a concussion and skipped practices on Wednesday and Thursday.
He stayed in the game for three plays after his return ended at the 4-yard line with 2 minutes, 4 seconds left in the first half -- blocking at fullback then right guard on the first two plays. He stayed at right guard for the next play, Tom Brady's 2-yard touchdown pass to Aaron Hernandez as the Patriots trimmed Green Bay's lead to 17-14.
"He just said he's fine," Patrick Connolly said Thursday in a telephone interview.
Dan, who has not spoken with the media since his run, seems to take everything in stride.
Undrafted out of Southeast Missouri State, Connolly played four games with Jacksonville as a rookie in 2005. He spent the next season on injured reserve and was cut by the Jaguars on Sept. 1, 2007, the day before his 25th birthday. The Patriots signed him 11 days later to their practice squad, where he spent the rest of the season.
Connolly appeared in just one game in 2008, then started four of his 14 games in 2009.
"Dan's always well prepared," Belichick said. "He kept working, kept getting better. He's developed a role for himself and has been a very productive player for us."
When left guard Logan Mankins stayed away in a contract dispute at the start of this season, Connolly started all seven games at his spot. Then he handled Mankins' return calmly.
"There's no telling what's going to happen once the game starts," he said then. "I may be right back in there, so I've just got to prepare myself for all those positions."
Connolly came off the bench in the next game but has started the six since then at right guard in place of Stephen Neal, who is on injured reserve.
"He's always thankful for what he has and works really hard," said Patrick Connolly, an award-winning chef in Boston and now chef at a restaurant in New York City's West Village. "He's still the same as when he was undrafted and on the practice squad at Jacksonville."
But he's famous now.
The kickoff return was the longest for an offensive lineman since Larry Tearry's 30-yarder for Detroit in 1978. Atlanta's Mal Snider had a 48-yard return in 1969 before complete records were kept.
The video of Connolly's run has received about 500,000 views on YouTube. The reigning AFC Special Teams player of the week is no longer just a big, anonymous body in the trenches.
But his teammates never viewed him that way.
"I had a lot more faith in Dan Connolly than you guys did before the season started," Mankins told reporters after returning to the Patriots. "Dan is a great friend of mine and he's done a great job. It was fun watching him play and get the opportunity to play to prove to everyone that he could do it."
The Patriots practice handling short kickoffs and it paid off against the Packers.
Mason Crosby wanted to keep the ball away from Brandon Tate, who has scored on two kickoff returns this season. So he hit a low drive that Connolly fielded cleanly on two hops at the 25-yard line and clutched to his stomach with two hands. At about his own 40, he found an opening and cut to the left.
Near the Green Bay 35, he stiff-armed safety Charlie Peprah and kept rambling along the sideline. Near the 13, he smoothly cut back toward the middle, eluding two defenders. Finally, Connolly was pulled down at the 4. He got up with a huge smile, surrounded by ecstatic teammates.
Some 200 miles away, Patrick Connolly and his wife were watching on television at their Manhattan home.
"I was laying on the floor. I just get as close as I can to the TV because I pretty much just watch him," said Patrick, who is four years older than Dan. "I think I probably screamed some curse word. We were jumping up and down."
His kid brother just had the thrill of a career.
"I think we felt just total exhilaration and shock," Patrick said. "That's pretty much the ultimate dream for a lineman."

CLINTON Odor improving at HerbKomp facility Composting operation's efforts to reduce smell are working, according to officials

Full text: Staff Writer
CLINTON -- A stinky problem that had become a public nuisance is now being fixed at the HerbKomp facility on Route 100, state officials say.
Most of the smelly odors had been created at the composting operation by seafood -- shellfish parts, animal bones and lobster-claw rubber bands -- that had been scattered around and not properly covered, according to inspections by the state Department of Agriculture.
Last month, complaints flooded in from neighbors, as well as town and state officials.
State officials gave HerbKomp's owner, Dwynn Williams, an outline of ways the facility could clean up its act and stop the bad smells.
This past week, those efforts appeared to be working.
"They've been cleaning up quite a bit -- the worst of it," said Mark Hedrich, nutrient management coordinator for the agriculture department. "We're just going to continue monitoring at this point, but we have been on top of it quite aggressively."
HerbKomp's owner, Dwynn Williams, couldn't be reached comment.
The company says on its website that it has developed "the best practice of processing aerobic compost" in Maine in response to increasing demand for quality soil for organic produce.
According to the website, HerbKomp's compost product, called Aerobic Digested Organic Matter, contains ingredients such as horse, cow and chicken manure, hay, clay, leaves, wood shavings, apples and water.
Complaints about odors from the facility came in October from five neighbors, Jeffrey Towne, who is chairman of the Board of Selectmen, and an official with the state Department of Environmental Protection.
In a letter written to Williams on Nov. 1, Hedrich outlined several ways of stanching the stink coming from the facility and said the matter would be referred to the state Attorney General's Office unless the "best practices" started in the next few weeks.
State officials inspected the facility three times in late October, according to Hedrich, and found the "offensive" odors "were resulting from shellfish and offal having been delivered to your site without appropriate amendment to minimize odors."
"Shellfish parts and large animal bones also were observed scattered about the site, as were rubber bands that had arrived at the site on lobster claws," Hedrich wrote.
The conditions were not in line with what the state considers "best management practices" and also violated state laws under the agriculture and nutrient statutes.
After talking it over Williams, state officials made several recommendations, including a review of covered materials and a compost management plan; no more delivering of fish or shellfish until it's handled properly; and removing rubber bands from lobster claws prior to arrival at the facility.
State officials also suggest a long-term goal of establishing a buffer of trees along the property's south side.

Five years after Katrina, priest still missing

Full text: LAKE CATHERINE, La. (AP) -- The night sky heaved like a living thing as Fire Chief Joe Perez took another slow cruise in the rescue truck down the two-lane road snaking across this town in the last patch of marsh standing between New Orleans and an angry Gulf of Mexico.
It was his final check before he, too, holed up in a safe haven just ahead of Hurricane Katrina.
On his dashboard, the radio was silent. His firefighters had left after a frantic weekend of tying down skiffs, helping folks pack up before the gusts and water arrived, getting fire trucks and equipment out of harm's way.
Perez slowed and drove down the shell road to St. Nicholas of Myra Church. Sure enough, Father Arthur Ginart was still at his simple steel-frame and brick veneer church built against a backdrop of marsh.
Katrina had developed into a Category 5 monster that nearly filled the Gulf on satellite images, and the hellish storm was due to make landfall within 12 hours. It was clear, though, that the 64-year-old priest, limping on prosthetic knees, was digging in, not leaving. Perez got out and walked over.
"You know I may not be able to come back," he said, trying one last time to get the stubborn priest to flee. "This is crazy. You've got to go. There's no telling what this storm's going to do."
"Joe," Ginart said patiently, "I've already told you. No cher, I'm staying. If it's God's will, I'll get washed away. If it's God's will, I'll go down with the church."
The chief nodded. He knew "Father Red" -- as the carrot-topped clergyman had come to be known to his flock -- well enough to accept defeat.
"I've got one of you all's radios, you know," the priest said reassuringly.
"Father Red, that radio is not going to do you any good."
"I'll see you tomorrow."
Perez nodded and said goodbye.
Counting the dead
It has been five years since Katrina swept across Lake Catherine, and Father Red remains among the missing.
For a society that craves closure and prides itself on leaving no one behind, the precise death toll from the August 2005 storm remains frustratingly elusive.
There are big differences, in the hundreds, between estimates of how many people perished. The confirmed toll stands at just over 1,800, mostly from Louisiana.
In Louisiana, 135 are, like Ginart, still officially categorized as missing (the Mississippi number stands at just three). But who died where and when is still a mystery in many cases.
By contrast, nearly every victim is accounted for after the 2001 suicide attacks on the World Trade Center. Workers sifted through tons of wreckage for traces of human tissue and bone against which DNA samples -- extracted from toothbrushes, combs, clothing -- were compared.
Some of those same techniques were used in Katrina's aftermath. But the two disasters were very different. While debris from the Twin Towers was largely confined to Lower Manhattan, Katrina's havoc was spread across three states and over more than 500 miles of coastline.
The story of the dead is told, in part, at the end of Canal Street, near New Orleans' famous "Cities of the Dead," where a mausoleum honors the remains of 80 Katrina victims. Half of them are people who were identified, but whose families either couldn't be found or didn't want to claim them; and the other half remain unknown.
"New Orleans has been a city for decades where people try to get lost in for various reasons," says Orleans Parish Coroner Frank Minyard.
And when Katrina hit, there were many lost people. Minyard's staff has done a remarkable job tracking them down. He maintains DNA profiles for all of the unknown dead, and anyone can come in and submit a cheek swab to be checked against the genetic files. None to date has produced a match, and Minyard says, "Nobody has come along in this past year."
Father Red was not one of those trying to lose himself. If anything, he saw his job as finding the lost.
A history of hurricanes
Sitting on an old land bridge between the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast, the tiny town of Lake Catherine had long ago learned to make peace with the water.
The original town -- home to railroad workers, trappers, hunters and fishermen -- was wiped out during a hurricane in 1915. Thirty-five people died, but the town was rebuilt and became home to a number of hunting and fishing clubs.
When Arthur Ginart (pronounced G'nart) arrived in town in 1976, the church of St. Nicholas of Myra -- the patron saint of sailors and travelers, as well as the model for Santa Claus -- was just five years old. Sitting on a concrete slab atop a big oyster shell mound, the sanctuary was built to keep up with the city's growing population and to meet the spiritual needs of the wild bunch out here.
Demographers might lump Lake Catherine into the New Orleans metropolitan area, and it does lie within the city limits. But with its bleary-eyed fishermen and toothless alligator hunters eating armadillo stew and sucking down beers at Crazy Al's bar on Sunday mornings, it's a world away.
Patrons still chuckle at the memory of Father Red storming in one Sunday while a porno film was playing on the TV over the bar.
"Just turn it off during Mass," the bearded clergyman pleaded. The bar complied.
Ginart wasn't exactly born a saint himself.
Having grown up in New Orleans' blue-collar Bywater district, Ginart boasted he once took a train for a little joyride when he was a boy. He smoked and cursed and flirted with alcoholism.
Perhaps all that explained his easy way with the fishermen, trappers and factory workers who made up his flock. He looked his parishioners right in the eye, and kept things short and simple -- especially his sermons.
"If I can't say what I want to say in five minutes, it's not worth it," he once said. "People stop listening after four minutes."
Fisherman Pete Gerica remembers Ginart was fond of saying his drinking days taught forbearance: "Bear the cross. Ask the Lord for help, shake it."
And everybody remembered Father Red -- whose eyebrows were really the only things still "red" about him besides his ruddy complexion -- as a football fan, a die-hard for "dem New Orleans Saints."
Back before they were Super Bowl champs, some called the hapless team the "Aints" and in shame would pull paper bags over their heads. Ginart kept a bag with eyeholes under the altar and was known to slip it on during Mass when the occasion called. He christened the path down to his church "Saints Avenue" and an adjoining street "Who Dat Lane."
Aug. 27, 2005
The evening of Saturday, Aug. 27, 2005, Ginart stood at the church's front door greeting his parishioners.
Water was already creeping in over the back yard of the church, just as it had nearly three weeks earlier when Hurricane Cindy came through. The church grounds got soggy just about every high tide, but everyone knew this was different.
There was still some light in the sky, but the first of Katrina's wind bands loomed on the horizon. The hurricane was heading straight toward Lake Catherine, outside the levee system that protected most of New Orleans proper.
Inside St. Nicholas, air conditioning units worked hard to keep the place cool. Outside, the marsh was alive with the sounds of screeching insects. As usual, Father Red's sermon was brief and comforting. He spoke of the approaching storm, then blessed the 125 or so worshippers and wished them the best.
Gerica and some others went across the lake to have dinner at Applebee's. Father Red headed for the modest 1950s-era mobile home adjoining the church where he received parishioners, slept and listened to his old-school jukebox.
And Katrina, with roaring winds and surging seas, barreled across the Gulf toward Louisiana.
At first, Michael Ginart didn't know whether his uncle and godfather had stayed behind for the storm. When he arrived in Lake Catherine that Friday after Katrina and saw the wreckage, he could only hope.
As he and two friends made their way to the church, heaps of marsh grass, boats, belongings and bits of homes blocked their path. Katrina's surge had reached about 20 feet here, flooding even fishing camps built atop sturdy pilings.
After picking their way along swollen canals and through back bayous, they finally reached St. Nicholas. It looked as if a bomb had gone off inside.
Walls and doors were blown out. Father Red's trailer was gone.
When Ginart spotted the little orange-red Dodge Neon resting in the marsh, he knew his uncle hadn't left. He loved that car and never would have left it behind.
No one in the close-knit community believed the priest could have made it. But his nephew couldn't just accept that the marsh had taken him.
Ginart, a lawyer, called the Archdiocese of New Orleans and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. By June 2006, a forensic pathologist had been hired to spend days scouring the marshes, cypress stands, ponds and bayous near the church.
He found a few personal effects -- a couple of photos, a lighter Father Red had saved from his smoking days, one of the priest's numerous jumpsuits.
Others joined the search. In the grass, a searcher found one of Father Red's favorite coffee cups, which had sat behind the priest's desk in the trailer. Corpse-sniffing dogs uncovered more personal items, but no bones.
Minyard's office compared the DNA from family members' hair follicles with his database of unclaimed victims. On more than one occasion, Michael Ginart was summoned -- for example, to see if the serial numbers from Father Red's knee replacements matched items that had come in.
Nothing.
Under Louisiana law, seven years must generally have passed before a judge can declare someone "dead in absentia." However, Father Red was declared "presumed dead" on May 17, 2010, under a post-Katrina law that shortened the period to two years for those missing from the storm.
Since the storm, friends of Father Red haven't waited to accept that he is gone -- or to honor his memory.
He was a volunteer firefighter in Terrytown and Fort Pike, a station up the road from St. Nicholas, and was trained as an emergency medical technician. He served as the auxiliary chaplain for the New Orleans Fire Department, and it was common for fire departments to ask him to bless trucks, firefighters and stations.
About a month ago, Lake Catherine completed its rebuilt fire house, and it was dedicated to Father Red.
Last week, hundreds of people and New Orleans Archbishop Gregory Aymond gathered at a New Orleans church for a somber memorial service in the priest's honor. His portrait was blessed with holy water and then hung on the wall inside the new suburban church in Katrina-scarred eastern New Orleans, where his old flock now prays.
St. Nicholas remains closed. Sitting amid the thrushes and cracking mud flats, the empty shell is slowly succumbing to the natural forces set in motion by the storm. For months after Katrina, dragonflies buzzed through its open walls and animals nested in the church. The archdiocese eventually mothballed St. Nicholas, erecting exterior corrugated walls.
The grassy slope where Father Red's trailer once stood is strewn with debris -- including a rusty electric piano, warped records from the priest's jukebox and the remains of his famously prodigious collection of Betamax videocassettes.
Inside the dark church, someone has arranged items -- a miniature plastic Christmas tree with presents, a camel from a Nativity scene, a votive candle -- on the floor as if waiting for the priest's return.
When the archdiocese announced plans around 2000 to close St. Nicholas as part of a restructuring, 250 people turned out to prove to the visiting archbishop that this was an active parish. The church hierarchy backed down, but the priest told his nephew to "keep a room for me" just in case. If the church were to close his parish, he said, he'd leave the priesthood.
There is talk of opening the church up someday as a camp for children.
"Father Red would have liked that," his nephew says.
After Katrina, his flock was at a loss for what to do without their shepherd. His absence is still keenly felt.
Alice Major went to St. Nicholas every day to pray. If the septuagenarian wasn't on her knees, she was in the kitchen baking Easter pastries or helping the Altar Society with Christmas dinner.
In the months after the storm, a Mass at a suburban and sterile church in New Orleans east only left her depressed. When she got home, she wept.
"I cry because I miss him," says Major, who keeps two crucifixes Father Red blessed for her close to her heart. "I miss our church. There will never be another Father Red."

PLYMOUTH, Mass. -- Mike Secondo remembers the days when Plymouth's docks outshone its rock.
Tourists swarmed the town pier in the 1970s and '80s, snapping pictures and bantering with commercial fishermen as they unloaded another shimmering haul for Secondo's company, Reliable Fish, to truck to points south.
Secondo is convinced Plymouth tourists went home remembering the fishermen more than Plymouth Rock, which commemorates the Pilgrims' landing in 1620.
"You couldn't move, (the tourists) were in awe of what they were looking at, the fish, the boats, the conversations that we were having," he said. "I mean, it was something years ago."
Today, Plymouth's fishermen are all but gone. Last year, according to federal statistics, Plymouth had zero landings of groundfish -- such as cod, haddock and flounder.
Tough new rules enacted in May have fishermen at New England's major ports, Gloucester and New Bedford, worried their history will fade away as fishermen faced with low catch limits sell out to larger interests. It's already happened in smaller ports, slowly changing the character of the New England coast.
Groundfishing has historically employed large numbers in good jobs. The romance of the deep-sea pursuit of fin fish is embedded in a region where its most famous cape is named after its most famous fish, the cod. People don't want that way of life to become just a memory.
"Is it progress to switch to a waterfront that produces food to a waterfront that hosts cocktail parties?" asked Warren Doty, a selectman in Chilmark on Martha's Vineyard, where fishermen are struggling to preserve a working waterfront on Menemsha Harbor.
A recent analysis indicates how densely the Northeast industry has consolidated around the major remaining ports.
The study by Cap Log Group Inc. and funded in part by the Environmental Defense Fund indicates that 31 million pounds of the 38 million pounds of groundfish caught in 2007 in Massachusetts, or 82 percent, were landed by vessels from either New Bedford, Gloucester or Boston.
Meanwhile, federal statistics show groundfishing has withered or vanished in numerous small and mid-sized ports in the last 30 years.
Rockland, in mid-coast Maine, landed 16 million pounds of groundfish three decades ago, but none last year. Jerry Carvalho said fishing boats once jammed city docks in Newport, R.I., where he's fished for three decades. Now, Newport is a tourist town that sells its beauty and Gilded Age history -- but almost no fish. The city went from 14 million pounds of groundfish in 1980 to a scant 37,000 in 2009.
In 1995, Marblehead, Mass., landed a half-million pounds of groundfish; South Bristol, Maine, landed 870,000; and Harwich Port on Cape Cod had 1.2 million. The total for each port last year was zero. (Federal rules don't require ports with less than three fishermen or dealers to report their catch.)
Tom Luce used longline hook-and-line gear to fish for cod off Harwich Port in the 1990s, until the fish seemed to go away. He's switched to fishing for conch, an edible mollusk, but other fishermen have left the harbor.
"It was just more lively (then)," he said. "There was product coming off the dock. And, now, there really isn't much."
Karen Alexander, a University of New Hampshire fisheries historian, said the industry was once so embedded in the region in the 19th century that even a tiny island like Islesford, Maine, with just a few dozen residents today, had 82 full-time fishermen.
"Every port was a significant port," Alexander said. "Fishing was spread like peanut butter on a slice of bread all over the coast of New England."
Fishermen say the industry's deterioration was caused by onerous regulation, which they say was pushed by environmentalists and based on flawed science that badly underestimates fish stocks. Environmentalists point to a legacy of overfishing enabled by poorly conceived rules that set too many boats loose on too few fish and devastated stocks.
William Leavenworth, another UNH fisheries historian, said the United States effectively stalled a long decline in the industry in 1976 by claiming coastal waters up to 200 miles from shore, booting out foreign fleets, and subsidizing domestic fishermen. By 1980, the number of Northeast vessels landing groundfish had doubled from about 600 to about 1,200, according to federal statistics, leading to massive -- and unsustainable -- catch increases.
In Gloucester, for example, the catch more than doubled from about 36 million pounds to 74 million between 1975 and 1980. Portland, Maine, went from 17 million to 27 million.
A decade later, fish stocks crashed, resulting in fishing restrictions in the mid-1990s that have only gotten tighter. Meanwhile, the fleet had dwindled by 2007 to about 820 boats, including 510 that fished enough to be considered full- or part-time, according to the Cap Log report.
Major stocks such as haddock and some species of cod have seen some recovery in recent years. Fishermen say the best thing to do to help is let them catch more fish, but fishing communities in Gloucester and Cape Cod have also set up "permit banks" to buy the expensive fishing permits and lease them to local fishermen at affordable rates.
At the Boston Fish Pier in South Boston, the smells of fish and diesel and the beeps of a forklift in reverse mark a waterfront that's still working, albeit with fewer workers. Veteran fisherman Mike Walsh remembers gear shops, an ice house and more fishing boats, not just at the pier, but stretching along the waterfront to berths downtown.
Now, he sees types of vessels that weren't there two and three decades ago, such as the water taxis that putter by and recreational boats like the one docked across the way.
Walsh knows waterfront property is coveted by interests with deeper pockets than his: office buildings surround the pier. But the city and region would sorely miss his fresh catch if Boston's fishermen disappear, he said.
"Come on, this is all natural, no additives here," Walsh said. "You cut the meat off the bone and you eat it, that's it. You ain't going to get better."

PORTLAND -- A team of 25 scientists surveying piers, docks and coves on the region's coast for invasive pests is documenting the growing problem of sea squirts as well as a newcomer, red alga, that's been spreading in southern New England.
The scientists wrapped up their weeklong survey Saturday by inspecting a cove and two marinas in Cape Elizabeth, South Portland and Freeport. Earlier in the week, the team visited sites in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
The goal is to develop a baseline inventory of marine animals and plants that have taken up residence in ocean waters where they don't naturally occur and determine if they pose threats to native organisms. The European green crab and the Asian shore crab, for instance, prey on commercially valuable shellfish, while other invasive species have been known to damage piers and pilings.
The worst group in recent years has been sea squirts, or tunicates, which are spreading across New England, said Jan Smith of the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management.
"They're like a creeping mass and smother other things," he said. "We're finding it virtually everywhere and it's smothering native communities."
This is the fourth time since 2000 that scientists have surveyed the New England coastline to collect information on ocean invaders. The survey is coordinated by the MIT Sea Grant program, the Massachusetts Bays Program and the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management, with assistance from estuary programs in different states.
There are at least 64 plants and animals, ranging from sea anemones to barnacles and crabs, that are not native to the region and can now be found in New England waters, Smith said.
This year's project brought together a team of scientists from the U.S., Canada, Brazil and the Netherlands who have taken samples at marinas and along the shore and examined their findings in laboratories.
Scientists this year have been seeing a red alga spread in southern New England, Smith said. The alga, which is native to the Pacific Ocean, first showed up three years ago in Narragansett Bay, but has yet to cause any problems.
Scientists also came across a sponge-like organism on a dock near Newport, R.I., that they couldn't identify, he said.
The survey is important because it provides information about species that could hurt both the ocean and those who make a living off of it, said Curtis Bohlen, director of the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership, which provides assistance to the survey.
Off Maine, sea squirts increasingly have been showing up on the ocean floor and growing on lobster traps that are set along the coast, Bohlen said.
"My concern is as these things are coming in, they're rearranging our marine ecosystem in ways we don't really understand," Bohlen said. "The potential risk to the way we make a living in Maine's marine environment is significant, and we'd like to know that before it becomes a problem."

Associated Press Writers
NEW ORLEANS -- In a nail-biting day across the Gulf Coast, engineers struggled to make sense of puzzling pressure readings from the bottom of the sea Friday, trying to determine whether BP's capped oil well was holding tight or in danger of springing a new leak.
No immediate leaks were spotted, which was encouraging; but midway through the testing period on the new temporary cap that was bottling up the crude inside the well, the pressure readings were not rising as high as expected, said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the government's point man on the crisis.
Allen said two possible reasons were being debated by scientists: The reservoir that is the source of the oil could be running lower than expected three months into the spill, or there could be an undiscovered leak somewhere down in the well. Allen ordered further study but remained confident.
"This is generally good news," he said, but he cautioned, "We need to be careful not to do any harm or create a situation that cannot be reversed."
He said the testing would go on into the night, at which point BP may decide whether to reopen the cap and allow some oil to spill into the sea again.
"No news is good news; I guess that's how I'd say it," Kent Wells, a BP PLC vice president, said on a conference call two hours after Allen spoke.
Throughout the day, no one was declaring victory -- or failure. President Barack Obama cautioned the public "not to get too far ahead of ourselves," warning of the danger of new leaks "that could be even more catastrophic."
Even if the cap passes the test, more uncertainties lie ahead: Where will the oil already spilled go? How long will it take to clean up the coast? What will happen to the region's fishermen? Will life on the Gulf Coast ever be the same again?
"I'm happy the well is shut off, that there's a light at the end of the tunnel," said Tony Kennon, mayor of hard-hit Orange Beach, Ala.; but he added, "I'm watching people moving away, people losing their jobs, everything they've got. How can I be that happy when that's happening to my neighbor?"
On Thursday, BP closed the vents on the new, tight-fitting cap and finally stopped crude from spewing into the Gulf of Mexico for the first time since the April 20 oil-rig explosion that killed 11 workers and unleashed the spill 5,000 feet down.
With the cap working like a giant cork to keep the oil inside the well, scientists kept watch on screens at sea and at BP's Houston headquarters, in case the buildup of pressure underground caused new leaks in the well pipe and in the surrounding bedrock that could make the disaster even worse.
Pressure readings after 24 hours were about 6,700 pounds per square inch and rising slowly, Allen said, below the 7,500 psi that clearly would show the well was not leaking. He said pressure continued to rise between 2 and 10 psi per hour. A low pressure reading, or a falling one, could mean the oil is escaping.
However, Allen he said a seismic probe of the surrounding sea floor found no sign of a leak in the ground.
Benton F. Baugh, president of Radoil Inc. in Houston and a National Academy of Engineering member who specializes in underwater oil operations, warned that the pressure readings could mean that an underground blowout could occur. He said the oil coming up the well may be leaking out underground and entering a geological pocket that might not be able to hold it.
Roger N. Anderson, a professor of marine geology and geophysics at Columbia University, said the oil pressure might be rising slowly not because of a leak, but because of some kind of blockage in the well.
"If it's rising slowly, that means the pipe's integrity's still there. It's just getting around obstacles," he said. He added that "any increase in pressure is good, not bad."
The cap is designed to prevent oil from spilling into the Gulf, either by keeping it bottled up in the well, or by capturing it and piping it to ships on the surface. It is not yet clear which way the cap will be used if it passes the pressure test.
Either way, the cap is a temporary measure until a relief well can be completed and mud and cement can be pumped into the broken well deep underground to seal it more securely than the cap. The first of the two relief wells being drilled could be done by late July or August.
In a positive sign, work on the relief wells resumed Friday. The project had been suspended earlier this week for fear that the capping of the well could interfere with it.
There was no end in sight to the cleanup in the water and on shore. Somewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons have spilled into the Gulf, according to government estimates.
In Orange Beach, Ala., long strands of white absorbent boom strung along the shore were stained chocolate brown after a fresh wave of BB-size tar balls washed up. Charter boat captains who can't fish because of the spill patrolled the shore, looking for oil slicks. Fishing guides spent their time ferrying Coast Guard personnel. A flotilla of fishing boats operating as skimmers plied the waters across the Gulf.
Large sections of the Gulf Coast have been closed to fishing and shellfish harvesting. Many fishermen have been hired out by BP to do cleanup work.
Cade Thomas, a 38-year-old fishing guide from Pine, La., said the whole mentality of the place is different.
"It's all changed dramatically. The fishing stories aren't there," he said. "There's no stories to tell except where we went to today and how much oil we saw."
In Grand Isle, La., most of the summer rental cottages are vacant, tables at the single high-end seafood restaurant are empty, and souvenir shops are barely doing enough business to pay the bills. A hand-painted sign along the main road rechristens the tourist town "Grand Oil."
Folks are grateful the gusher has been stopped, but many say it is too late to save this summer. Thousands of tourists have gone elsewhere.
Scientists cannot say for certain what the long-term environmental effect will be; but long after the well is finally plugged, oil still could be washing up in marshes and on beaches as tar balls or patties.
There is also fear that months from now, those tar balls could move west to Corpus Christi, Texas, or travel up and around Florida to Miami or North Carolina's Outer Banks.
Tim Kerner, mayor of Lafitte, La., said the crisis isn't over by a long shot.
"There's millions and millions of gallons of oil out there, and they need to keep the fishermen working," he said. "We need to constantly have that boom up absorbing oil along the banks and hard boom in the bayous to protect the marshland. It's no time to pull back. It's time to continue to fight until we know it's over."
Kerner added: "I don't want everybody to think we won this battle. This battle's going to be ongoing for a while."

NEW ORLEANS -- The oil has stopped. For now.
After 85 days and up to 184 million gallons, BP finally gained control over one of America's biggest environmental catastrophes Thursday by placing a carefully fitted cap over a runaway geyser that has been gushing crude into the Gulf of Mexico since early spring.
Though a temporary fix, the accomplishment was greeted with hope, high expectations -- and, in many cases along the beleaguered coastline, disbelief. From one Gulf Coast resident came this: "Hallelujah." And from another: "I got to see it to believe it."
If the cap holds, if the sea floor doesn't crack and if the relief wells being prepared are completed successfully, this could be the beginning of the end for the spill. But that's a lot of ifs, and no one was declaring any sort of victory beyond the moment.
The oil stopped flowing at 3:25 p.m. EDT when the last of three valves in the 75-ton cap was slowly throttled shut. That set off a 48-hour watch period in which -- much like the hours immediately after a surgery -- the patient was in stable, guarded condition and being watched closely for complications.
"It's a great sight," said BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles, who immediately urged caution. The flow, he said, could resume. "It's far from the finish line. ... It's not the time to celebrate."
Nevertheless, one comforting fact stood out: For the first time since an explosion on the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon oil rig killed 11 workers April 20 and unleashed the spill 5,000 feet beneath the water's surface, no oil was flowing into the Gulf.
President Barack Obama, who has encouraged, cajoled and outright ordered BP to stop the leak, called Thursday's development "a positive sign." But Obama, whose political standing has taken a hit because of the spill and accusations of government inaction, cautioned that "we're still in the testing phase."
The worst-case scenario would be if the oil forced down into the bedrock ruptured the seafloor irreparably. Leaks deep in the well bore might also be found, which would mean that oil would continue to flow into the Gulf. And there's always the possibility of another explosion, either from too much pressure or from a previously unknown unstable piece of piping.
The drama that unfolded quietly in the darkness of deep water Thursday was a combination of trial, error, technology and luck. It came after weeks of repeated attempts to stop the oil -- everything from robotics to different capping techniques to stuffing the hole with mud and golf balls.
The week leading up to the moment where the oil stopped was a series of fitful starts and setbacks.
Robotic submarines working deep in the ocean removed a busted piece of pipe last weekend, at which point oil flowed unimpeded into the water. That was followed by installation of a connector that sits atop the spewing well bore -- and by Monday the 75-ton metal cap, a stack of lines and valves latched onto the busted well.
After that, engineers spent hours creating a map of the rock under the sea floor to spot potential dangers, like gas pockets. They also shut down two ships collecting oil above the sea to get an accurate reading on the pressure in the cap.
As the oil flowed up to the cap, increasing the pressure, two valves were shut off like light switches, and the third dialed down on a dimmer switch until it too was choked off.
And just like that, the oil stopped.
It's not clear yet whether the oil will remain bottled in the cap, or whether BP will choose to use the new device to funnel the crude into four ships on the surface.
For nearly two months, the world's window into the disaster has been through a battery of BP cameras, known as the "spillcam." The constant stream of spewing oil became a fixture on cable TV news and web feeds.
That made it all the more dramatic on Thursday when, suddenly, it was no more.
On the video feed, the violently churning cloud of oil and gas coming out of a narrow tube thinned, and tapered off. Suddenly, there were a few puffs of oil, surrounded by cloudy dispersant that BP was pumping on top. Then there was nothing.
"Finally!" said Renee Brown, a school guidance counselor visiting Pensacola Beach, Fla., from London, Ky. "Honestly, I'm surprised that they haven't been able to do something sooner, though."
Alabama Gov. Bob Riley's face lit up when he heard the news. "I think a lot of prayers were answered today," he said.
The next 48 hours are critical. Engineers and scientists will be monitoring the cap around the clock, looking for pressure changes. High pressure is good, because it shows there's only a single leak. Low pressure, below 6,000 pounds per square inch or so, could mean more leaks farther down in the well.
Thad Allen, the retired Coast Guard admiral overseeing the spill for the government, said they are deciding as they go along whether to release oil into the water again. At the end of the 48-hour test it's possible oil will start to flow again -- but, theoretically, in a controlled manner.
When the test is complete, more seafloor mapping will be done to detect any damage or deep-water leaks.
The saga has devastated BP, costing it billions in everything from cleanup to repair efforts to plunging stock prices. Though BP shares have edged upward, they shot higher in the last hour of trading on Wall Street after the company announced the oil had stopped. Shares rose $2.74, or 7.6 percent, to close at $38.92 -- still well below the $60.48 they fetched before the rig explosion.
The Gulf Coast has been shaken economically, environmentally and psychologically by the hardships of the past three months. That feeling of being swatted around -- by BP, by the government, by fate even -- was evident in the wide spectrum of reactions to news of the capping.
"Hallelujah! That's wonderful news," Belinda Griffin, who owns a charter fishing lodge in Lafitte, La., said upon hearing the gusher had stopped. "Now if we can just figure out what to do with all the oil that's in the Gulf, we'll be in good shape."
The fishing industry in particular has been buffeted by fallout from the spill. Surveys of oyster grounds in Louisiana showed extensive deaths of the shellfish. Large sections of the Gulf Coast -- which accounts for 60 to 70 percent of the oysters eaten in the United States -- have been closed to harvesting, which helps explain why one oysterman in Louisiana refused to accept that progress was afoot.
Prove it, said Stephon LaFrance of Burress, La.
"I've been out of work since this happened, right? And I ain't never received nothing from BP since this oil spill happened," he said. "Like they say they stopped this oil leak. I think that's a lie. I got to see it to believe it."
Rosalie Lapeyrouse, who owns a grocery store and a shrimping operation in Chauvin, La. that cleans, boils and distributes the catch, was shocked.
"It what?" she said in disbelief. "It stopped?" she repeated after hearing the news.
"Oh, wow! That's good," she said, her face clouding. "I'm thinking they just stopped for a while. I don't think it's gonna last. They never could do nothing with it before."
Long after the out-of-control well is finally plugged, oil could still be washing up in marshes and on beaches as tar balls or disc-shaped patties. The sheen will dissolve over time, scientists say, and the slick will convert to another form.
There's also fear that months from now, oil could move far west to Corpus Christi, Texas, or farther east and hitch a ride on the loop current, possibly showing up as tar balls in Miami or North Carolina's Outer Banks.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is expecting to track the oil in all its formations for several months after the well is killed, said Steve Lehmann, a scientific support coordinator for the federal agency.
Once the well stops actively spewing oil, the slicks will rapidly weather and disappear, possibly within a week, and NOAA will begin to rely more heavily on low-flying aircraft to search for tar balls and patties. Those can last for years, Lehmann said.
In Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish, the worst-hit area of the coast, frequent BP and government critic Billy Nungesser, the parish president, offered a word of caution: This whole mess, he said, is far from over.
"We better not let our guard down," Nungesser said. "We better not pull back the troops because, as we know, there's a lot of oil out there, on the surface, beneath it. And I truly believe that we're going to see oil coming ashore for the next couple of years."

Associated Press Writers
NEW ORLEANS -- BP allayed last-minute government fears of making the disaster worse and began testing the new, tighter-fitting cap Wednesday that could finally choke off the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico.
Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, the Obama administration's point man on the disaster, said the government gave the go-ahead after carefully reviewing the risks.
"What we didn't want to do is compound that problem by making an irreversible mistake," he said at the end of a 24-hour roller-coaster of hopes raised, hopes dashed and hopes raised again along the Gulf Coast.
The cap -- a 75-ton metal stack of pipes and valves -- was lowered onto the well on Monday in hopes of either bottling up the oil inside the well machinery, or capturing it and funneling it to the surface. But before BP could test the equipment, the government intervened because of second thoughts about whether the buildup of pressure from the gushing oil could rupture the walls of the well and make the leak worse.
"We sat long and hard about delaying the tests," Allen said. He said that the pause was necessary in the interest of the public, the environment and safety, and that officials were convinced the test could go forward.
The test began with BP shutting off pipes that were funneling some of the oil to ships on the surface so the full force of the gusher went up into the cap. Then deep-sea robots began slowly closing, one at a time, three openings in the cap that let oil pass through. Ultimately, the flow of crude will be blocked entirely. All along, engineers will be watching pressure readings to learn whether the well is intact.
Allen said BP will monitor the results every six hours and end the test after 48 hours to evaluate the findings.
The one-day delay came just when it looked as if the Gulf oil crisis was nearing an end. The holdup was met with disappointment along the Gulf Coast.
"This thing's been going on for so long now, it's time to take a gamble," said Mitch Jurisich, a third-generation oyster farmer from Empire, La. "If it's going to blow the bottom of the ocean out, it's just going to blow the bottom out."
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the government acted "out of an abundance of caution to do no harm," and added that he did not consider the delay to be "some giant setback."
With the testing on hold, oil continued to spew nearly unimpeded into the water. Two vessels on the surface collected about 700,000 gallons on Tuesday, BP said. The government estimates 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons are leaking every day.
BP also said it was halting drilling for the duration of the test on one of two relief wells that are intended to plug the gusher permanently from deep underground. The company said it was stopping the work because it was not clear what effect the testing of the cap could have on it. Work on the other relief well had already been stopped according to plan.
Before BP got the go-ahead for the cap test, BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles urged Gulf residents to be patient.
"We're going to get this thing stopped as fast as we can," he said. "If it is not in the next couple of days with the test, we'll do it with the relief wells."
Tony Wood, director of the National Spill Control School at Texas A&M-Corpus Christi, said the government's caution is a prudent course, because so much of the work being contemplated is uncharted territory.
Wood said trapping the erupting oil in the cap could increase pressure inside the casing, or the piping inside the well, and could fracture it until it is leaking like a sieve. That could make it impossible to plug up the well.
The caution follows a string of failed attempts by BP to contain the leak, including the use of a giant concrete-and-steel box that quickly became encased in ice-like crystals; a colossal siphon tube that trapped very little oil, and an effort to jam the well by pumping in mud and shredded rubber.
As of Wednesday, the 85th day of the disaster, an estimated 92 million to 182 million gallons of oil had spewed into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP exploded April 20, killing 11 workers.

Portland Press Herald
PORTLAND -- With the lobster boat stopped near Fort Gorges, the delegation donned long rubber aprons and gloves and got a warning from Tom Martin to keep their hands away from the winch.
The Chinese business leaders gathered around as Martin, the owner of Lucky Catch Cruises, hauled up the traps. He explained the mechanism of the traps, told them that females with eggs must be thrown back, and showed them how to measure a lobster.
The one he held met the size standard -- at least 3 inches from the back of the eyes to the edge of the main body -- and could go into the tank.
"Big enough!" Martin said, to cheers from the group.
Friday's outing was part of a crash course on Maine's lobster industry for representatives of COFCO -- a conglomerate that includes China's largest food importer -- and Hopu Investment Management.
The group was in Maine at the invitation of independent candidate for governor Eliot Cutler, of Cape Elizabeth.
"I want them to understand Maine lobster is better than Australia and New Zealand lobster, that we produce enough to export to China, and that it is a sustainable fishery -- which is very important to China -- and that they and we can make a lot of money with trade going that way," Cutler said.
The delegation included Ning Gaoning, chairman of COFCO; Paul Liu, president of Ceroilfood, a subsidiary of COFCO; and Fang Fenglei, Hopu's chairman.
Cutler lived in China for two years, moving there to open an office for his law firm. He got to know Fang then, and in recent months met Ning through Fang.
Friday's schedule included a visit to Portland Shellfish Co., where the visitors tasted products and saw workers butcher live lobsters, pack tails for flash freezing and pick cooked meat by hand. They then had a lobster roll lunch at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute with representatives of the industry.
The day's activities combined business and fun, said Liu, who is based in New York. He said that, while there certainly is a market for lobster in China, more study is needed -- on issues including marketing, the catch and processing -- before the businesses decide whether to pursue opportunities in Maine.
"We'll do our homework, keep contact with people here and see what happens from there," he said.
The group learned that Maine's lobster catch is 75 million pounds a year, and that an estimated 35 million pounds could be available for export to China. That amount, which could be worth about $200 million a year, would be enough to consider pursuing, said Guy Cui, one of the partners in Hopu.
"Two hundred million dollars is something worth exporting. Twenty million is too small," he said.
Ning, who goes by "Frank," said he would first want to build the Maine brand in China, where lobster is now associated with Australia or Boston. He would work with frozen products before considering importing live lobster, which poses more logistical challenges.
Dane Somers, executive director of the Maine Lobster Promotion Council, said working with COFCO would be an enormous opportunity. He said it would broaden the market and help firm up prices for exports.
"That's a nice way of saying, 'Whoever pays the most gets the lobster,'" he said.
In November's election, Cutler will face Democrat Libby Mitchell, Republican Paul LePage and two other independents, Shawn Moody and Kevin Scott.
Arden Manning, the state Democrats' campaign coordinator, said it wasn't surprising that Cutler arranged to bring the delegation to Maine, given that he lived in China.
"It's hard to say you know what Mainers are going through if you live in China and, really, have lived in Washington before that. That might be a concern for Maine voters," he said.

Voters will decide June 8 whether the state should borrow $10.25 million to upgrade water infrastructure and improve water quality. The bond would be matched with $33.25 million in federal and private funds.
If approved, Question 5 would replenish two funds that lend money to communities and water districts on a revolving basis; as the loan is repaid with interest, the money is lent again.
The Safe Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund would receive $3.4 million that is needed to secure $17 million in federal money over the next two years.
There are more than 20 projects awaiting funding, according to Nancy Beardsley, director of the Division of Environmental Health at the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, which manages the fund.
The highest-priority projects are those that address a public health risk, she said, such as the presence of contaminants in water.
Many areas of Maine have relatively high concentrations of natural arsenic and uranium in its water, Beardsley said, noting the federal government has installed new safety limits for these chemicals in the past several years.
The department received requests to fund projects that would cost $42 million this year, and anticipates being able to spend only $18 million if the bond package is approved.
"We have more projects each year than we have money available," said Beardsley.
Question 5 also includes $3 million that would bring in an additional $15 million in federal money for the Wastewater Treatment Facility State Revolving Loan Fund.
Municipalities can borrow money from this to upgrade their sewer systems and eliminate combined sewer and storm-water overflow systems present in larger communities. This fund has been in place for 20 years and has loaned out over $500 million.
"We need to have federal money continue to flow into the fund to keep it going," said Stephen McLaughlin, engineering manager for the Bureau of Land and Water Quality at the Department of Environmental Protection, which manages the waste-water fund. "Currently, we have documented waste-water needs of another $500 million within the next five years that need to be dealt with."
If Question 5 is approved, $1 million will help towns without sewer systems work with homeowners and small businesses to build septic systems, cleaning up cesspools and straight pipes that still exist and dump sewage into streams.
Another $600,000 would go toward eliminating overboard discharge systems that, even when working properly, require the banning of shellfish harvesting around the state in anticipation of system failure.
In addition, $750,000 would go to investigate and clean up areas of hazardous contamination, and $600,000 more would be used to make grants that would enable poorer communities to build sewerage systems. This program would bring in a match of $900,000 in other funds.
Another $1 million would go to help farmers build irrigation ponds and wells to ease weather-related risk and reduce the environmental impact of pumping water from rivers. In the past decade, this program has protected 9,000 acres of crops worth $21 million, according to Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture Ned Porter.
Democrats generally support the bond package, saying investing in Maine's infrastructure will pay dividends in terms of creating jobs and preparing the state for the future.
Sen. Minority Leader Kevin Raye, R-Perry, said he expects voters to be more selective about bonds this year because of the precious state of the economy and what he considers to be excessive borrowing.
"Many issues that in past years could have sailed to passage are going to be rough sledding," he said. "The water bond is one that I think is extraordinarily valuable, especially given the federal match. I am hopeful that as voters go through that selective process that they look very carefully at it."

Jarod Bray is asking people to pay him not to catch lobsters.
For $1,350 a year, Bray will send the customer the identification tag -- required by law -- off one of his 800 lobster traps with a pledge not to fish it. He said he reduces his carbon footprint by using less fuel, and his gear poses less risk to the endangered right whale. Farmers get paid not to grow certain crops, so why not pay lobstermen not to catch lobsters, Bray asks.
Bray, who fishes with his father, Joe, off Matinicus Island, launched his "No Impact Trap" business and website, www.ecolobstercatch.com, last fall. Although he has yet to find any takers, he said people have told him he is on to something.
"Everyone is trying to be green and eco-friendly," said Bray.
Known for creative marketing ploys, Maine's 4,330 lobster fishermen are casting about for new ways to broaden demand for the venerable crustacean. Adopt-a-trap programs, peddling right off the boat or at farmer's markets and selling shares of the catch are among the recent innovations.
Lobstermen say they are just trying to cope with the uncertainty over what 2010 holds, following several years marked by soaring fuel costs, rock bottom lobster prices and, last summer, enough competition to trigger lobster wars.
"Every other week there is something challenging," said Dane Somers, executive director of the Maine Lobster Promotion Council.
The lobster promotion council is pushing the "new shell lobster," also known as softshell lobster, as the tastier alternative to hardshell specimens, which fetch higher prices because they are easier to ship.
"Some people are convinced it is sweeter and more tender and if you talk to chefs they love to get their hands on a nice new shell lobster," said Somers.
Lobstermen say the only thing that saved them from total disaster last year was a record catch. In 2009, Maine lobstermen hauled in 75.5 million pounds. But the lobster was worth a lot less -- $221 million, compared with the $244 million value of the 69.8 million pounds caught in 2008. Fishermen received $2.93 per pound last year, compared with $3.50 a pound in 2008 and the peak price of $4.63 a pound in 2005.
This year, lobstermen are worried not only about the troubled economy and whether Americans have regained their appetite for the luxury shellfish, but also about the price of bait. Federal regulators have imposed a quota on herring, a favored baitfish.
Although the lobster population has been deemed relatively healthy, there is growing scientific concern over the high level of lobstering, said David Etnier, deputy commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
"There is a lot of gear in the water and a lot of fishermen that could pose a long-term threat," said Etnier.
Such talk sends shivers through an industry that prides itself on its self-imposed sustainable fishing practices. In recent years, regulators have stepped in to require costly replacements of fishing gear and to restrict the entry of new lobstermen into the fishery.
Stuart Norton, owner of Three Sons Lobster and Fish in Portland, said although business has picked up around the holidays -- he was busy with Mother's Day orders on Friday -- the days of people from out of state ordering a shipment on a whim show no signs of coming back.
Norton predicts the glut of lobsters will continue this summer, bad for the harvesters but great for consumers, with prices even better than last summer, when some retail markets were selling small soft shells for as little as $3.50 a pound.
"It is not going to be the luxury food it once was," Norton said.
Others are more optimistic. Somers said he has seen some encouraging signs. He said people who attended the European Seafood Exposition in Brussels last month and the International Seafood Show in Boston in March said they felt customers are coming back and the worst is behind them.
"Not that things are going to be wonderful," said Somers.
Longtime Yarmouth lobsterman Willis Spear said he is feeling more certain about the cost of bait, after his suppliers assured him they would have plenty on hand through August at least. He said all he can do is hope for the best.
"We are always cautiously optimistic or we would never go out," said Spear.

AND SETH BORENSTEIN
Associated Press Writers
VENICE, La. -- A sense of doom settled over the American coastline from Louisiana to Florida on Saturday as a massive oil slick spewing from a ruptured well kept growing, and experts warned that an uncontrolled gusher could create a nightmare scenario if the Gulf Stream carries it toward the Atlantic.
President Barack Obama planned to visit the region Sunday to assess the situation amid growing criticism that the government and oil company BP PLC should have done more to stave off the disaster. Meanwhile, efforts to stem the flow and remove oil from the surface by skimming it, burning it or spiking it with chemicals to disperse it continued with little success.
"These people, we've been beaten down, disaster after disaster," said Matt O'Brien of Venice, whose fledgling wholesale shrimp dock business is under threat from the spill.
"They've all got a long stare in their eye," he said. "They come asking me what I think's going to happen. I ain't got no answers for them. I ain't got no answers for my investors. I ain't got no answers."
He wasn't alone. As the spill surged toward disastrous proportions, critical questions lingered: Who created the conditions that caused the gusher? Did BP and the government react robustly enough in its early days? Most important, how can it be stopped before the damage gets worse?
The Coast Guard conceded Saturday that it's nearly impossible to know how much oil has gushed since the April 20 rig explosion, after saying earlier it was at least 1.6 million gallons -- equivalent to about 21/2 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The blast killed 11 workers and threatened beaches, fragile marshes and marine mammals, along with fishing grounds that are among the world's most productive.
Even at that rate, the spill should eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history within about a week; but a growing number of experts warned that the situation already may be much worse.
The oil slick on the water's surface appeared to triple in size over the past two days, which could indicate an increase in the rate that oil is spewing from the well, according to one analysis of images collected from satellites and reviewed by the University of Miami. While it's hard to judge the volume of oil by satellite because of depth, it does show an indication of change in growth, experts said.
"The spill and the spreading is getting so much faster and expanding much quicker than they estimated," said Hans Graber, executive director of the university's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing. "Clearly, in the last couple of days, there was a big change in the size."
Florida State University oceanography professor Ian R. MacDonald said his examination of Coast Guard charts and satellite images indicated that 8 million to 9 million gallons already had spilled by Wednesday.
Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production, said it was impossible to know just how much oil was gushing from the well, but said the company and federal officials were preparing for the worst-case scenario.
Oil industry experts and officials are reluctant to describe what, exactly, a worst-case scenario would look like -- but if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and is carried it to Florida's beaches, it stands to be an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions.
The Deepwater Horizon well is at the end of one branch of the Gulf Stream, the famed warm-water current that flows from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic.
Several experts said that if the oil enters the stream, it would flow around the southern tip of Florida and up the eastern seaboard.
"It will be on the East Coast of Florida in almost no time," Graber said. "I don't think we can prevent that. It's more of a question of when rather than if."
At the joint command center run by the government and BP near New Orleans, a Coast Guard spokesman maintained Saturday that the leakage remained around 5,000 barrels, or 200,000 gallons, per day.
However, Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, appointed Saturday by Obama to lead the government's oil spill response, said no one could pinpoint how much oil is leaking from the ruptured well, because it is about a mile underwater.
"And, in fact, any exact estimation of what's flowing out of those pipes down there is probably impossible at this time due to the depth of the water and our ability to try and assess that from remotely operated vehicles and video," Allen said during a conference call.
From land, the scope of the crisis was difficult to see. As of Saturday afternoon, only a light sheen of oil had washed ashore in some places.
The real threat lurked offshore in a swelling, churning slick of dense, rust-colored oil the size of Puerto Rico. From the endless salt marshes of Louisiana to the white-sand beaches of Florida, there is uncertainty and frustration about how the crisis got to this point and what will unfold in the coming days, weeks and months.
The concerns are both environmental and economic. The fishing industry is worried that marine life will die -- and that no one will want to buy products from contaminated water anyway. Tourism officials are worried that vacationers won't want to visit oil-tainted beaches. Environmentalists are worried about how the oil will affect the countless birds, coral and mammals in and near the gulf.
"We are just waiting," said Meghan Calhoun, a spokeswoman from the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans. "We know they are out there. Unfortunately the weather has been too bad for the Coast Guard and NOAA to get out there and look for animals for us."
Fishermen and boaters want to help contain the oil; but on Saturday, they were hampered again by high winds and rough waves that splashed over the miles of orange and yellow inflatable booms strung along the coast, rendering them largely ineffective. Some coastal Louisiana residents complained that BP, which owns the rig, was hampering mitigation efforts.
"They're letting an oil company tell a state what to do," said 57-year-old Raymond Schmitt, in Venice preparing his boat to take a French television crew on a tour.
"I don't know what they are waiting on," Schmitt said. He didn't think conditions were dangerous. "No, I'm not happy with the protection, but I'm sure the oil company is saving money."
As bad as the oil spill looks on the surface, it may be only half the problem, said University of California Berkeley engineering professor Robert Bea, who serves on a National Academy of Engineering panel on oil pipeline safety.
"There's an equal amount that could be subsurface too," said Bea, who worked for Shell Oil Co. in the 1960s when the last big northern Gulf of Mexico oil well blowout occurred. That oil below the surface "is damn near impossible to track," he said.
Louisiana State University professor Ed Overton, who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills, worries about a total collapse of the pipe inserted into the well. If that happens, there would be no warning and the resulting gusher could be even more devastating because regulating flow then would be impossible.
"When these things go, they go kaboom," he said. "If this thing does collapse, we've got a big, big blow."
BP has not said how much oil is beneath the Gulf seabed Deepwater Horizon was tapping, but a company official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the volume of reserves, confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels.
At a church in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson told a gathering of community leaders that the spill has created an "environmental challenge of the highest order."
"Every oil spill is a challenge; but this is quite different because of where it is, because the marshes are so different than the beach and the coastline in Alaska when we had the Valdez," she said. "This one is complicated by the fact that the well head is 5,000 feet below the water."
The Coast Guard's Allen said Saturday that a test of new technology used to reduce the amount of oil rising to the surface seemed to be successful.
During the test Friday, an underwater robot shot a chemical meant to break down the oil at the site of the leak rather than spraying it on the surface from boats or planes, where the compound can miss the oil slick.
In Pass Christian, Miss., Jimmy Rowell, 61, a third-generation shrimp and oyster fisherman, worked on his boat at the harbor and stared out at the choppy waters.
"It's over for us. If this oil comes ashore, it's just over for us," Rowell said angrily, rubbing his forehead. "Nobody wants no oily shrimp."

MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER -- High winds and choppy seas frustrated efforts to hold back the oil spill seeping into Louisiana's rich fishing grounds and nesting areas Friday, and the government desperately cast about for new ideas for dealing with the nation's biggest environmental crisis in decades.
President Barack Obama, meanwhile, halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent a repeat of the disaster that was set in motion when an offshore platform exploded and sank 50 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico.
The mile-deep BP well continued to spew an estimated 200,000 gallons of crude a day. Many of the more than two dozen lawsuits filed in the wake of the explosion claim it was caused when workers for oil services contractor Halliburton Inc. improperly capped the well. Halliburton denied it.
The seas were too rough and the winds too strong Friday to burn off the oil, suck it up effectively with skimmer vessels, or hold it in check with the miles of orange and yellow inflatable booms strung along the coast.
The floating barriers broke loose in the choppy water, and waves sent oily water lapping over them.
"It just can't take the wave action," said Billy Nungesser, president of Louisiana's Plaquemines Parish.
The spill -- a slick more than 130 miles long and 70 miles wide -- threatens hundreds of species of wildlife, including birds, dolphins and the fish, shrimp, oysters and crabs that make the Gulf Coast one of the nation's most abundant sources of seafood. Louisiana closed some fishing grounds and oyster beds because of the risk of oil contamination.
Lawsuits filed this week, including one by an injured technician on the platform, claim that Halliburton improperly cemented the well. Cementing is a process in which a slurry is used to fill the gap between the drilled hole and the casing, or the pipe that brings oil and gas up out of the ground.
In a statement, Halliburton said workers had finished a cementing operation 20 hours before the rig went up in flames. But the company said it was "premature and irresponsible to speculate" on what caused the disaster.
According to a 2007 study by the federal Minerals Management Service, which examined the 39 rig blowouts in the Gulf of Mexico between 1992 and 2006, cementing was a contributing factor in 18 of the incidents. In all the cases, gas seepage occurred during or after cementing of the well casing, the MMS said.
At least 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled, according to Coast Guard estimates.
As of Friday, only a sheen of oil from the edges of the slick was washing up at Venice, La., and other extreme southeastern portions of Louisiana. But several miles out, the normally blue-green gulf waters were dotted with sticky, pea- to quarter-sized brown beads with the consistency of tar.
High seas were in the forecast through Sunday and could push oil deep into the inlets, ponds, creeks and lakes that line the boot of southeastern Louisiana. With the wind blowing from the south, the mess could reach the Mississippi, Alabama and Florida coasts by Monday.
"These next few days are critical," Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal warned.
For days, crews have struggled without success to activate the well's underwater shutoff valve using remotely operated vehicles. They are also drilling a relief well in hopes of injecting mud and concrete to seal off the leak, but that could take three months.
At the rate the oil is pouring from the sea floor, the leak could eclipse the worst oil accident in U.S. history -- the 11 million gallons that spilled from the supertanker Exxon Valdez off Alaska in 1989 -- in just two months.
U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he pressed the chief executive of BP to "work harder and faster and smarter to get the job done." He said the government will not rest until BP seals the well and "they clean up every drop of oil."
As for the cause of the accident, he said: "I am confident we will get to the bottom of what happened here. Those responsible will be held accountable."
In the search for creative solutions to the problem, the state of Louisiana opened gates built into the Mississippi River levees in hopes that the rush of fresh water would drive the oil away from the coast. But the tactic did not appear to work.
"The diversion can't compete with the wind right now," said Garret Graves, the governor's adviser on coastal issues.
With the government and BP running out of options, Salazar said he asked other companies across the oil and gas industry "to bring their global expertise to the situation to make sure that no idea worth pursuing is not pursued."
BP likewise sought ideas from some of its rivals and planned to use at least one of them Friday -- applying chemicals underwater to break up the oil before it reaches the surface. That has never been attempted before at such depths.
More than 1,900 people, some 300 vessels and dozens of aircraft took part in the effort to contain the slick, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said. The Pentagon authorized two massive Air Force C-130 Hercules cargo planes to join civilian craft that have been dumping tens of thousands of gallons of oil-dispersing chemicals.
An animal rescue operation at Fort Jackson, about 70 miles southeast of New Orleans, had its first patient Friday, a bird covered in thick, black oil. The bird, a young northern gannett found offshore, is normally white with a yellow head.
Across the state line in Gulfport, Miss., scientists, veterinarians and researchers at the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies worked frantically to prepare for the possible arrival of hundreds of oily sea mammals. The institute has surgery and exam rooms, eight large pools, and X-ray and ulatrasound equipment.
Dr. Moby Solangi, the nonprofit center's director, said this is birthing season for the roughly 5,000 dolphins along the Mississippi and Louisiana coasts.
"It's very bad timing," he said. "We're looking at a colossal tragedy."
Ten sites that the American Bird Conservancy considers globally important bird areas are directly in the path of the oil slick, the group said.
"This spill spells disaster for birds in this region and beyond," said ABC President George Fenwick. "It is ironic that next weekend is International Migratory Bird Day. At a time when we should be celebrating the beauty and wonder of migratory birds, we could be mourning the worst environmental disaster in recent U.S. history."
Volunteers converged on the coast to offer help.
Valerie Gonsoulin, a 51-year-old kayaker from Lafayette who wore an "America's Wetlands" hat, said she hoped to help spread containment booms.
"I go out in the marshes three times a week. It's my peace and serenity," she said. "I'm horrified. I've been sitting here watching that NASA image grow, and it grows. I knew it would hit every place I fish and love."
Along a canal in St. Bernard Parish, Hal Cyprian tied string on a piece of chicken, tossed it into the water and quickly pulled out a half-dozen crabs. He planned to cook them up as a Mother's Day treat for his wife.
"If the oil comes, then the crabs are through," he said. "That's why I come today."
President Obama, who recently announced plans to open large swaths of the U.S. coast to offshore oil exploration, ordered Salazar to report within 30 days on what new technology is needed to tighten safeguards against spills from deepwater drilling.
"Let me be clear: I continue to believe that domestic oil production is an important part of our overall strategy for energy security," Obama said. "But I've always said that it must be done responsibly for the safety of our workers and our environment."

Associated Press Writers
VENICE, La. -- An oil spill that threatened to eclipse even the Exxon Valdez disaster spread out of control and started reaching land along the Gulf Coast Thursday night as fishermen rushed to scoop up shrimp and crews spread floating barriers around marshes.
The spill was bigger than imagined -- five times more than first estimated -- and closer. Fingers of oily sheen were reaching the Mississippi River delta, lapping the Louisiana shoreline in long, thin lines.
"It is of grave concern," David Kennedy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press. "I am frightened. This is a very, very big thing. And the efforts that are going to be required to do anything about it, especially if it continues on, are just mind-boggling."
The oil slick could become the nation's worst environmental disaster in decades, threatening hundreds of species of fish, birds and other wildlife along the Gulf Coast, one of the world's richest seafood grounds, teeming with shrimp, oysters and other marine life. Oil was thickening in waters south and east of the Mississippi delta about five miles offshore.
The leak from the ocean floor proved to be far bigger than initially reported, contributing to a growing sense among many in Louisiana that the government failed them again, just as it did during Hurricane Katrina. President Barack Obama dispatched Cabinet officials to deal with the crisis.
Cade Thomas, a fishing guide in Venice, worried that his livelihood will be destroyed. He said he did not know whether to blame the Coast Guard, the federal government or oil company BP PLC.
"They lied to us. They came out and said it was leaking 1,000 barrels when I think they knew it was more. And they weren't proactive," he said. "As soon as it blew up, they should have started wrapping it with booms."
The Coast Guard worked with BP, which operated the oil rig that exploded and sank last week, to deploy floating booms, skimmers and chemical dispersants, and set controlled fires to burn the oil off the water's surface.
The Coast Guard urged the company to formally request more resources from the Defense Department. A BP executive said the corporation would "take help from anyone."
Government officials said the blown-out well 40 miles offshore is spewing five times as much oil into the water as originally estimated -- about 5,000 barrels, or 200,000 gallons, a day.
At that rate, the spill could eclipse the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- the 11 million gallons that leaked from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989 -- in the three months it could take to drill a relief well and plug the gushing well 5,000 feet underwater on the sea floor.
Ultimately, the spill could grow much larger than the Valdez because Gulf of Mexico wells typically hold many times more oil than a single tanker.
Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP Exploration and Production, had initially disputed the government's larger estimate.
But he later acknowledged on NBC's "Today" show that the leak may be as bad as federal officials say. He said there was no way to measure the flow at the seabed, so estimates have to come from how much oil rises to the surface.
Mike Brewer, 40, who lost his oil spill response company in the devastation of Hurricane Katrina nearly five years ago, said the area was accustomed to the occasional minor spill. But he feared the scale of the escaping oil was beyond the capacity of existing resources.
"You're pumping out a massive amount of oil. There is no way to stop it," he said.
An emergency shrimping season was opened to allow shrimpers to scoop up their catch before it is fouled by oil. Cannons were to be used to scare off birds. And shrimpers were being lined up to use their boats as makeshift skimmers in the shallows.
This murky water and the oysters in it have provided a livelihood for three generations of Frank and Mitch Jurisich's family in Empire, La.
Now, on the open water just beyond the marshes, they can smell the oil that threatens everything they know and love.
"Just smelling it, it puts more of a sense of urgency, a sense of fear," Frank Jurisich said.
The brothers hope to get all the oysters they can sell before the oil washes ashore. They filled more than 100 burlap sacks Thursday and stopped to eat some oysters.
"This might be our last day," Mitch Jurisich said.
Without the fishing industry, Frank Jurisich said the family "would be lost. This is who we are and what we do."
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Thursday so officials could begin preparing for the oil's impact. He said at least 10 wildlife management areas and refuges in his state and neighboring Mississippi are in the oil plume's path.
The declaration also noted that billions of dollars have been invested in coastal restoration projects that may be at risk. He also asked the federal government if he could call up 6,000 National Guard troops to help.
As dawn broke Thursday in the oil industry hub of Venice, about 75 miles from New Orleans and not far from the mouth of the Mississippi River, crews loaded an orange oil boom aboard a supply boat at Bud's Boat Launch. There, local officials expressed frustration with the pace of the government's response and the communication they were getting from the Coast Guard and BP officials.
"We're not doing everything we can do," said Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish, which straddles the Mississippi River at the tip of Louisiana.
Tension was growing in towns like Port Sulphur and Empire along Louisiana Highway 23, which runs south of New Orleans along the Mississippi River into prime oyster and shrimping waters.
Companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips have facilities nearby, and some residents are hesitant to criticize BP or the federal government, knowing the oil industry is as much a staple here as fishing.
"I don't think there's a lot of blame going around here. People are just concerned about their livelihoods," said Sullivan Vullo, who owns La Casa Cafe in Port Sulphur.
A federal class-action lawsuit was filed late Wednesday on behalf of two commercial shrimpers from Louisiana, Acy J. Cooper Jr. and Ronnie Louis Anderson.
The suit seeks at least $5 million in compensatory damages plus an unspecified amount of punitive damages against Transocean, BP, Halliburton Energy Services Inc. and Cameron International Corp.
In Buras, La., where Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005, the owner of the Black Velvet Oyster Bar & Grill couldn't keep his eyes off the television. News and weather shows were making projections that oil would soon inundate the coastal wetlands where his family has worked since the 1860s.
It was as though a hurricane was approaching, maybe worse.
"A hurricane is like closing your bank account for a few days, but this here has the capacity to destroy our bank accounts," said Byron Marinovitch, 47.
"We're really disgusted," he added. "We don't believe anything coming out of BP's mouth."
Signs of the 2005 hurricane are still apparent here: There are schools, homes, churches and restaurants operating out of trailers, and across from Marinovitch's bar is a wood frame house abandoned since the storm.
A fleet of boats working under an oil industry consortium has been using booms to corral and then skim oil from the surface.
The Coast Guard abandoned a plan Wednesday to set fire to the leaking oil after sea conditions deteriorated. The attempt to burn some of the oil came after crews operating submersible robots failed to activate a shut-off device that would halt the flow of oil.
Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was briefed Thursday on the issue, said his spokesman, Capt. John Kirby. But Kirby said the Defense Department has received no request for help, nor is it doing any detailed planning for any mission on the oil spill.
Obama dispatched Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson to help with the spill. The president said the White House would use "every single available resource" to respond.
Obama has directed officials to aggressively confront the spill, but the cost of the cleanup will fall on BP, White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said.

DETROIT -- It was a popular roller-skating rink since the 1950s. Now, it's a hub of all things antique.
Welcome to the Roller Rink Antique Mall on Route 100 in Detroit, which used to be the Spotlight Pavilion Roller Skating Rink. On opening day Thursday, there was a long line of cars parked up and down the road.
The owners, Paul and Maureen Greene, of Newport, said they were amazed at the turnout.
"I'm humbled; people have put their trust in us," Paul Greene said on a warm and sunny Friday afternoon. "A lot of people have come out to support us. We've tried to do everything we can to be dealer and customer friendly."
The Greenes said they had initially looked at the building as a place to store auction items as part of their existing "Greene's Cove Auction" business, but the space was far too big for that.
One night, Maureen Green, who survived a bout with cancer eight years ago, said she had an inspiration.
"I got to thinking what we could do with the building so big, so I thought we could open the building front as an antique store," she said.
So that's what they did. They purchased the spot on Feb. 18, giving themselves about five weeks to get it ready for customers.
And in transforming the space into an antique mall, the 7,200-square-foot building has also held onto its roots. The Greenes said they included "roller rink" in the business's name because it seemed "perfect" and they used to visit the rink when it was open. They have also hung vintage photos of the roller-skating rink on the wall.
Even so, "we did put a lot of work into it," Maureen Greene said, by renovating the interior.
Sandy Welsh, of Dover-Foxcroft, an employee and a vendor with her own booth of antiques, said she got into the business by purchasing items on the Web site eBay. Welsh said she was excited to see hundreds of people come to check out the store, saying it's rare to hear about such a business opening; most are closing, she said.
"It couldn't have gotten any better," Welsh said. "The sun came out and a long line of people were at the door."
The mall has space for at least 50 vendors and is nearly full at the moment, though some spaces are still available, the Greenes said. The cost to vendors ranges from $30 per shelf per month to $189 per month for a full-sized booth.
The vendors offer a variety of antique items, from tools, dishes and furniture, to old comic books, taxidermy, jewelry and glassware. Displayed in an aisle is a large, "one of a kind" handmade boat, costing $595. Nearby is a rocking chair for $25 and rustic farm tools for a buck or two.
Janice and Bruce Ogilvie, of Skowhegan, liked what they saw as they pursued items Friday afternoon. They picked up a tin food strainer costing $5 and a glass oyster dish costing $7.50.
Welsh thinks the antique mall fills a need in the community.
"Things are cheaper than at retail stores and it's about having a piece of history," she said.
The Roller Rink Antique Mall is open every day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and can be reached at 487-5565.

MADISON -- Oyster River Lobster opens its doors today, offering an assortment of seafood, including lobsters, shrimp, crab, oysters and haddock.
While several restaurants serve seafood dishes, Oyster River Lobster, situated at 30 Main St., is the only business in Madison geared specifically toward wholesale and retail seafood products.
Co-owner Jeffrey Brow, 55, is well-acquainted with the area. For the last year, he has sold seafood out of his truck in the parking lot at Taylor's Drug Store, on Main Street. He was also at the same spot about a decade ago.
"We just want everyone to come to Madison to buy seafood," said the town's economic development director, Joy Hikel, who helped the owners for six months to find a suitable location. "I think he'll be a draw for the town ... I'm excited. It will be nice. Just having it down the street is good for me."
Brow, with his wife Sharon and son Josh, own another store by the same name on Camden Road in Warren. He said he enjoys Madison.
"I just liked the town a lot, and the people are good to work with," he said of opening the new store.
Despite additional trucking costs to central Maine, the Madison store's prices will be the same as those in Warren. "We're bringing the coastal prices to the area," Josh Brow said.
The seafood is trucked the two-hour drive from wharfs in Port Clyde and Rockport and then stored in ocean water. No chemicals are used, and only the best hard-bottom, deep-water lobsters are sold in the store, Jeffrey Brow said. He said he ships any lower-quality lobsters to processing plants in Canada.
The store also offers to-go items, such as lobster and crab rolls, as well as chowder. They plan to introduce local food products, and hope to hire a couple of employees if business goes well, Josh Brow said.
Jeffrey Brow said he grew up in the seafood business. He started lobstering with his father when he was 12 years old. "Hauling, clamming, shrimping, scalloping, I've done every bit of it," he said. He said he opened Oyster River Lobster in Warren in 1986.
Maine's lobstermen lost about $50 million in revenues in 2008, according to a report produced by the Moseley Group in June 2009 to determine Maine's economic stability in the lobster industry.
People can reach the store by calling Josh Brow at 542-6806.

AUGUSTA -- Traces of old and unused medications that people throw out with the trash are showing up in water, and Maine lawmakers took a step Wednesday toward reversing the problem -- at the expense of the pharmaceutical industry.
By a 91-51 vote, the House of Representatives endorsed a bill to create a prescription drug take-back program. It would require drug manufacturers, individually or in groups, to set up and operate programs to collect, transport, manage and dispose of unwanted drugs from residences.
"We have a long, long history of putting chemicals into the environment where we aren't thinking about what the long-term impacts are, and this is one where we can address it," Rep. David Van Wie, D-New Gloucester, a former director of the state Bureau of Land and Water Quality, said during a debate.
Maine is one of 13 states with bills this year addressing pharmaceutical collection or disposal, according to the National Conference of state Legislatures. An Illinois law bars health care facilities from disposing of unused medications in wastewater systems. Under Maine's bill, which faces further House and Senate votes, manufacturers would have to pay for a collection and disposal program.
The industry has placed ads in Maine newspapers saying the proposal's expenses will be passed to consumers in higher medicine prices. Industry group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America says that levels of pharmaceuticals found in water supplies and landfills are too tiny to pose any risk.
Minute amounts of discarded drugs, such as antidepressants, birth control pills and over-the-counter pain relievers, have been found in water at Maine landfills in Augusta, Brunswick and Bath, confirming suspicions that pharmaceuticals thrown into household trash are ending up in water that drains through waste.
While drug-tainted leachate doesn't pose a direct threat to drinking water, environmental officials want to know whether water that flows into rivers from sewage treatment plants affects fish and shellfish. About 90 percent of the drugs found in water were excreted and flushed, not dumped into the trash, lawmakers for and against the bill agreed.
But sewage treatment plants are not equipped to filter out the drug traces that are pumped in, said Van Wie. And the remaining 10 percent that's trashed is significant, said Rep. Anne Perry, D-Calais, who's been working on the legislation for seven years.
While some Maine police agencies have run community drug-collection programs, state environmental officials say most Mainers have no way to properly dispose of their medications.
Rep. Linda Sanborn, D-Gorham and a medical doctor, recalled patients in her practice bringing bags of old drugs back to her for disposal. Having a mix of drugs around the house can cause confusion among some patients, who might ingest the wrong pills.
"Yes, we are asking the pharmaceutical industry to help us," said Rep. Patricia Jones, D-Mount Vernon. "With the huge profits they're making, it's only reasonable to ask that."
Jones also noted that the bill can also be defended on public safety grounds because it can discourage thefts from homes where prescription drugs -- particularly painkilling opiates -- are kept or where thieves believe they are kept. Jones said she was the victim of such a theft.
An opponent of the bill, Rep. Michael Celli, said he objected to "bashing" of the pharmaceutical industry.
"We do not bash the phone companies, the gas companies, the energy companies, credit card companies, insurance (companies)," said the Brewer Republican.
He said drug manufacturers already spend millions researching potential cures that never make it to the marketplace.
Opponents also argued that many questions remain about details of the legislation, which "still need a lot of time and a lot of work," said Rep. Meredith Strang Burgess, R-Cumberland.

POPHAM BEACH STATE PARK Heavy rains may ease erosion issue

PHIPPSBURG -- For months, Dick Hill has been nervously watching the erosion at Popham Beach State Park.
Since November, the shifting Morse River has eaten away the sand dunes to within 25 yards of the park's bath house and septic system, toppling hundreds of trees and further threatening a beach that for the past few years disappears at each high tide. Last week, Hill organized a meeting to rally support for a dredge-and-fill operation to put the Morse River back on its original course -- a move opposed by abutting landowners.
But this weekend, an unusual trifecta of ocean surf and tides could solve the decades-old erosion of Popham Beach.
"Mother nature is going to do the heavy lifting for free," state marine geologist Stephen Dickson gleefully predicted last week.
Dickson said the storm system on Thursday and Friday created a tidal surge and a pounding surf from 10- to 15-foot waves offshore, followed by astronomical high tides Saturday and today. That may be enough to recut the original channel, which Dickson said will result in a visibly enlarged beachfront with room for sunbathers even at high tide as early as this summer.
"You might see this once in a lifetime," said Dickson, who has spent his professional career studying the sands at the mouth of the Kennebec River.
The sands at Popham Beach have been shifting since the glaciers departed 20,000 years ago, leaving behind mountains of sand that washed down the Kennebec River to form a beach system unique to the Maine coast. Today, sands extend out several miles along an area stretching from Small Point Beach at the tip of Phippsburg Peninsula to Reid Sate Park at the tip of the Georgetown peninsula on the mouth of Sheepscot River.
The sandbars attract birds. Sand dollars cover the sandy underwater delta. The area is a magnet for winter flounder, which prefer sandy ocean bottoms.
The Morse River, which lies on the western end of three-mile long Popham Beach, carries the tides from the ocean into the marshes behind the beach. The river channel naturally changes course every 15 years or so, moving eastward and back, from a straight path to the ocean to an angled approach.
"Like a tail on a dog wags back and forth," said Dickson.
But for the past decade, the tail has continued to wag toward the state park, causing the beach to erode more than at any time in the past century.
A series of easterly storms in the past couple of years accelerated the erosion. That pushed the high tide mark inland by about 180 feet -- to within 75 feet of one of two new bath houses that opened last summer, part of a $1.4 million improvement project.
Hundreds of trees fell into the river. With about 10 feet of shoreline disappearing each week, park officials obtained a special permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in November for a project to stem the erosion.
The permit allowed the state to rig a temporary sea wall by bundling the fallen trees and securing them with ropes to others on high ground. The temporary wall has worked.
"We have lost inches rather than hundreds of feet since we did that in early November," said John Picher, director of engineering and realty at the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands.
At the same time, bureau officials met owners of property abutting the Morse River. They hoped to get permission to cut a channel through the sand bars now blocking the river's direct outlet to the ocean, and to block off the new channel that has been carved out.
The abutters, including the Bates-Morse Mountain Conservation Area, the Small Point Association and the Nature Conservancy of Maine, said they were not interested in human intervention in the area, preferring to let nature take its course.
Laura Sewall, director of the Bates-Morse Mountain Conservation Area, said it was not clear that cutting a channel would permanently solve the problem and abutters were worried about how the work would affect wildlife. The conservation area is used for educational research.
"It could not serve as a laboratory that teaches us about natural processes," said Sewall.
Clammers were equally displeased with the prospect of human interference and the potential loss of clam beds that had been uncovered by the changing course of the river.
"Who is going to pay the clammers for the loss of all of these clams?" asked Richard Lemont, a former long-time chairman of the Phippsburg Shellfish Committee.
But beachfront residents such as Dick Hill, worried that the Morse River would erode the beach in front of their homes, were anxious to see the channel cut.
"My family has been going to that park since the turn of the last century," said Hill.
He said if the erosion were to reach the park's septic systems the entire beach area might have to be shut down because of the resulting pollution.
Other visitors to the beach -- there are 175,000 annually, making it one of the most heavily used state parks in Maine -- say it would be great if they no longer were forced to abandon the beach for a couple of hours around each high tide.
"I just want to make sure it is still here so we can use it," said Susie Reinheimer of Bowdoinham, who was riding her horse, Cody, on the beach last week.
Will Harris, Bureau of Parks and Lands director, said the channel-cut proposal has now been shelved, and moving the building and septic system is not financially feasible. No other practical solutions have surfaced.
"We have done pretty much what we can do," said Harris.
Which means Harris and others are hoping that Dickson is right, and the storms and high tides this weekend will deepen a new fledgling channel that has developed and send the Morse River back on a straight course. After Thursday and Friday, several more feet had been eaten into the shoreline and more trees had toppled over near the bath house.
But there were signs that the erosion had shifted further east. Dickson said it will be clear by Wednesday, once the high tides wane, whether the river has changed course.
He said the new channel has to be scoured out to a depth greater than the existing channel, like a seesaw. Then the sand will begin to build back on the park side of Morse River.
"It could tip the balance and help save the Popham State Park," said Dickson.

PORTLAND -- The federal government advises throwing most unused or expired medications into the trash instead of down the drain, but they can end up in the water anyway, a study from Maine suggests.
Tiny amounts of discarded drugs have been found in water at three landfills in the state, confirming suspicions that pharmaceuticals thrown into household trash are ending up in water that drains through waste, according to a survey by the state's environmental agency that's one of only a handful to have looked at the presence of drugs in landfills.
That landfill water -- known as leachate -- eventually ends up in rivers. Most of Maine doesn't draw its drinking water from rivers where the leachate ends up, but in other states that do, water supplies that come from rivers could potentially be contaminated.
The results of the survey are being made known as lawmakers in Maine consider a bill, among the first of its kind in the nation, that would require drug manufacturers to develop and pay for a program to collect unused prescription and over-the-counter drugs from residents and dispose of them.
Scientists and environmentalists have long known of the common presence of minute concentrations of pharmaceuticals in drinking water, either through human excretion flushed into sewers or leftover medicine thrown down the drain. Research shows that pharmaceuticals sometimes harm fish and other aquatic species, and that human cells can fail to grow normally in the laboratory when exposed to trace concentrations of certain drugs.
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection found tiny amounts -- measured in parts per trillion -- of medications ranging from antidepressants and birth control pills to blood pressure and cholesterol prescriptions. The most prevalent drugs were over-the-counter pain relievers, including ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
"People need a way to properly dispose of their drugs, and they're not getting it right now," said Mark Hyland, director of the state Department of Environmental Quality's Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management.
The bill is one of many "take-back" programs under consideration in more than half a dozen states and would be the first of its kind if enacted; it has won committee support and awaits further action.
The bill is opposed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a Washington-based organization that represents pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and has partnered with other groups to pay for advertising against the proposal.
The lobby acknowledges that previous testing shows trace levels of pharmaceuticals can be found in water supplies and landfills, but says the levels are so small that they pose little risk.
"The amounts of pharmaceuticals (in the environment) are infinitesimally small," said Marjorie Powell, senior assistant general counsel. "We're talking about two drops in an Olympic-size swimming pool."
The state last October tested leachate at landfills in Augusta, Brunswick and Bath. Hyland ordered up the study after members of the pharmaceutical industry expressed skepticism about the presence of pharmaceuticals in landfill water.
Leachate at Maine landfills typically is piped or trucked to municipal wastewater treatment plants. Those plants are not equipped to remove drugs from the water before it is discharged into rivers and the ocean.
The pharmaceuticals found in the landfills don't pose a direct threat to drinking water, Hyland said. The landfills are lined to protect groundwater supplies, and in Maine there aren't any wastewater plants that treat leachate and discharge into rivers that ultimately supply drinking water.
But the leachate -- in high enough concentrations -- can pose a threat to fish and shellfish. Research suggests that hormonal drugs, such as birth control pills, tend to feminize fish. If the trend continues, Hyland said, there could be too few male fish to continue reproduction.
"What you find are greater concentrations of females downstream from where they've seen a dose of hormones, so you find a feminization of the fish population where there are fewer males around," he said.
Hyland said he has questions about the effect on commercial seafood -- one of Maine's biggest industries -- in ocean waters downstream from the rivers, particularly bivalves such as clams or mussels, which filter water constantly and live near the shore.
"But obviously we need to know a lot more before we can draw a lot of conclusions," Hyland said.
Although landfill leachate doesn't get into drinking water supplies in Maine, it probably does elsewhere, said Andy Tolman, a geologist with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. And some scientists urge caution about the dangers of drinking such water over several decades.
"Many larger states have big rivers that are used for both waste disposal and drinking water supplies, places like Ohio and Pennsylvania," Tolman said. "The same river gets used a number of times, and they're very concerned about treatment of sewage and leachate."
Powell, from the pharmaceutical lobby, argued that people can properly dispose of their drugs in their household trash. In Maine, much of the trash is burned, she said, and pollution control experts agree that incinerating unwanted drugs is the safest solution.
She argued that if the bill does pass, it will only make drugs more expensive, she said.
Concerns have grown in recent years over pharmaceuticals reaching drinking water supplies. An Associated Press investigation in 2008 reported that the drinking water of at least 51 million Americans contains minute concentrations of a multitude of drugs.
It's commonly believed that the vast majority of drugs that get into water supplies come from human and animal excretion and that smaller amounts come from flushing them down the toilet or drain, a practice the Food and Drug Administration says is not recommended for most medications.
Federal guidelines recommend using community drug take-back programs to dispose of medications. If those aren't available, people should mix their unwanted drugs with cat litter or some other undesirable substance, put them into a sealed container and put it in the trash, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Full text: In the eyes of religion, marriage is a sacred covenant created by God.
In the eyes of the state, however, marriage is little more than a word defining certain legal rights, benefits and protections. These include joint tax filing, property inheritance, hospital visitation, and participation in a spouse's health-care benefits.
Can anyone anywhere explain what any of that has to do with what God considers sacred? How does giving two men a "tax credit" detract from the sanctity or blessedness of someone else's covenant?
It all stems from fear, I guess. Fear that granting homosexuals the same legal status as heterosexuals will in some way anger the Creator.
After all, Leviticus 18:22, calls homosexuality an abomination, right? Never mind that, seven chapters earlier, it makes the same case for shellfish. Yet have you ever had a crisis of conscience over a good lobster?
Paul's first letter to the Corinthians says nothing specifically about gay marriage, but clearly states that homosexuals will not enter the kingdom of God. Of course, he says the same thing about greedy people, drunkards and the verbally abusive. Yet would any of us deny marriage to a Yankees fan, hellbound though they be?
Dress it up however you want, voting "yes" on Question 1 boils down to "hatred." Pure and simple.
But, I don't hate homosexuals, you gasp. I just don't think they should be allowed to get married.
There were people like that during the Civil Rights era, too. They didn't "hate" black people. They just didn't think they should be allowed to drink from the same water fountain.
You may not be chanting racial slurs, and to suggest that another human being isn't as worthy of "x,y,z" as you are, may not be "hate," but it sure ain't love.

LUBEC -- On the waters of Cobscook Bay this week, fishing boats are abundant: 23 boats in the water by dawn Monday.
This is the first day of the sea urchin dragging season, and in these rich waters -- the extreme tides bring in nutrients to the sea life --sea urchins are plentiful.
Captain Jonathan Wallace, owner of the dragger Endangered Species, and his two deckhands, Daphne Savage and Derek Lyons, work nonstop.
With an ear-jarring screech, the winch pulls up the drag -- a suspended basket constructed of metal rings -- and holds it above a work table at the back of the boat.
Savage and Lyons open the drag and its booty spills out: hundreds of sea urchins mixed in with a little kelp, a few green crabs, a starfish or two and plenty of ungainly-looking sea cucumbers.
The pair work feverishly sorting the urchins by size -- nothing smaller than 21/16 inches can be taken -- and with a swipe of their arms, the rest is dropped back into the sea.
Wallace pilots the boat back and forth, back and forth, in 31-foot deep water off Cooper's Island. Box after box of sea urchins pile up on the deck.
Wallace cracks an urchin open, revealing its creamy, carrot-colored roe that is prized in Asia as a delicacy.
"There it is," he says. "That is what we are all after."
From no rules to overfished
The unattractive, spiny sea urchin once was a nuisance to lobster fishermen, getting caught in their traps and pricking their hands.
But all that changed in 1986, when a group of international seafood buyers came calling. Urchin eggs, or uni, are highly sought after by the Japanese as a rare and expensive delicacy.
"The urchins used to be garbage," Wallace said. "Now they are a resource."
By the late 1980s, Japan's sea urchin harvest had dropped 41 percent due to overfishing, and marketers were looking for fresh supplies. It turned out that the cold waters off Maine produced some of the finest urchins anywhere.
When the Maine market first began to blossom, urchins were going for 14 to 28 cents a pound and the harvest was unregulated. Urchin landings skyrocketed. More than 1,500 divers worked the sea year round, and prices shot as high as $3.50 a pound, according to the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Licenses to help DMR track the number of urchin harvesters were put into effect in January 1992. Earning $150,000 during the 85-day season was not unheard of. Landings reached a high of 41.6 million pounds in 1993, according to the DMR, a level that clearly was not sustainable.
In January 1994, a more comprehensive management plan went into effect, which limited the amount that can be harvested and created two fishing zones. Zone 1 extends from Kittery to Rockland and Zone 2 from Vinalhaven to Canada.
Since then, the catch has continuously declined until some promising signs appeared this year.
University of Maine researchers determined in 2003 that divers and draggers were killing urchins about three times faster than the mollusks were able to replace themselves, and that only about 10 percent of the once-plentiful urchin population remained.
With urchin stocks in Zone 1 virtually depleted, only 10 days of harvesting is allowed. In Zone 2, where stocks are greater, 45 days are allowed.
An industry destroyed?
In 1994, there were 2,725 Maine urchin licenses; this year there are 434. In 1994, 40 million pounds of urchins were harvested; last year, 2.7 million pounds were taken.
Urchin buyer Atchan Tamaki of ISF Trading in Portland and Lubec said Maine has slipped from once being the No. 1 supplier of urchins, to the No. 3 slot behind Russia and China.
Tamaki was the pioneer of Maine's urchin business and said that, at the peak, he bought 12 million pounds of urchin roe from Maine fishermen. This year he expects to buy about 1.5 million pounds.
Although the harvest figures have plummeted, DMR scientist Margaret Hunter says the industry has not been destroyed. In fact, a spring assessment is cause for optimism in Zone 2, she said.
"We found that Zone 1 really hasn't recovered," she said.
But the decline in Zone 2 seems to have leveled off and could be rebounding.
"It is possible there is some improvement," she said. "We are keeping our fingers crossed and being very tentative about our optimism. We still have a $5 million (annual value) industry here."
Marcus Jones, of Gouldsboro, is on the state Sea Urchin Zone Council, a DMR advisory board made up of industry people and scientists, and was one of the divers who participated in the assessment.
"It was good and we were pleasantly surprised," he said. "This was the first year we saw large sized urchins. There were places in Jonesport where the bottom was covered."
Jones said the assessment involved 162 diving locations from New Hampshire to Eastport. He said half of the sites were computer-selected while the rest were traditional urchin breeding locations.
Jones said that what he saw during the dives indicated the shortened season and the management plan are working.
"Without a doubt, the curtailed season should continue," he said.
Hunter said reseeding trials conducted last April off Winter Harbor also showed promise.
"We are still assessing the numbers, but the divers are reporting to us that the population is looking really good," Hunter said.
Reseeding, in which adult urchins are relocated to depleted areas, is tricky because once the urchin population is removed from an area, algaes such as kelp grow back.
"This algae then harbors small crabs and other life that feeds on small urchins," Hunter said. "This has proven very difficult to reverse. Even though reseeding has shown some promise, it would have been better to manage the stock in the first place."
Doug McNaught, a scientist at the University of Maine at Machias, agrees with Hunter. McNaught studies urchin survival rates and using reseeding to recover the urchin population.
"The population in Zone 2 appears to be leveling out, albeit at low levels," he said. "It appears to be 10 percent of what it once was."
As a member of the urchin council, McNaught said many options are currently being looked at to manage the industry.
"We are trying to come up with new regulations," he said. "We will continue to work over the next few months, and by next spring we should have new recommendations for the DMR and the Legislature."
McNaught said some of the options being researched include changing the number of harvest days, instituting quotas, or creating a flexible harvest season that would allow for harvesting on good weather days for safety reasons.
Another member of the council, Jim Wadsworth of Camden, who buys urchins, said that balancing the need to keep the fishery vital and the need to protect the resource is a tough balancing act.
"I've been doing this 20 years and this may be my last year," Wadsworth said, but added that shutting down the harvest to give it time to recover would be too harsh a blow.
"The Maine processors would lose their market position," he said. "If the buyers can't get urchins in Maine, they'll go somewhere else. I think we have to find a way to make it work."
Regulations: Help or hinder?
Wallace watched Monday as his deckhands tossed more small urchins back into the cold waters than they keep. He called Monday's harvest "a good day" and was encouraged by the numbers found. When he reached the dock in Lubec late in the afternoon and the seafood buyers swarmed around the load, he collected $4,000 for the day's work.
He said the urchin population is sound in Cobscook Bay and chafes hard against the 45-day season limit.
"I'm catching only 10 percent of what is on the bottom," Wallace said. "Between equipment issues and weather, we're lucky to get 35 days in. Every other state seems to help their fishermen. Maine seems to hold us back."
A fourth-generation fisherman, Wallace said the urchin fishery days should be expanded.
Many of the urchin fishermen feel this way, but DMR and others disagree, arguing that the management of the urchin population through shortening the season is working.
"We have the most controversial fisheries in the world right here in Maine," Jones said. "It was tough to change, to go from a completely unregulated system to one with such a shortened season, but once it happened and we are now seeing the result, we are convinced of its value."
Jones said he was asked in the 1990s if the urchin beds would ever be "fished out" and he said no.
"The places where we were then seeing urchins 3 to 4 inches deep are not totally barren. It was the cowboy mentality -- take it all -- that got this fishery here in the first place."
Jones said he believes the shortened season system should stay in place "at least another four years. If not managed properly this time, we'll be in the same place as the herring and other fisheries. It will simply be gone."

SCARBOROUGH -- An intense red tide outbreak that closed much of Maine's clam flats is retreating, but just as the state began reopening some areas to diggers, heavy rains over the weekend led to a shellfishing ban for southern and midcoast Maine.
"You kind of get used to red tides, but these rain closures are really taking a (toll). This year, it's been a combination of both," said Tim Downs, a Scarborough digger.
Downs and others diggers learned Thursday that the state was reopening clam flats in Jones Creek, a branch of the Scarborough River near Pine Point. But before diggers had a chance to reach the flats during a low tide Friday, the state announced a flood closure stretching from New Hampshire to Port Clyde.
"It never got dug," said Dave Corbeau, Scarborough's marine resources officer. "They only dug, I think, four days in the last five weeks. That's five weeks of prime-time digging."
Clam diggers now hope to go back to work by the weekend, and they say this summer's above-normal rains and record-setting red tides have already made this the worst in a string of bad years for the industry.
Heavy rains trigger automatic closures because they can flood the coast with contaminated stormwater and bacteria from overflowing sewers and septics. Since June 1, Portland has received 16.4 inches of rain, more than 10 inches more than normal.
Red tide, a seasonal bloom of toxic algae that can make shellfish dangerous to eat, triggers closures based on how much of the toxin is present. The red tide became so intense in recent weeks that it turned some parts of the ocean reddish brown and was blamed for killing fish and birds, effects rarely seen in Maine.
"We're just now starting to see (the red tide) pull out," said Darcie Couture, director of the Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program for Maine's Department of Marine Resources. "It's going to be a long, uphill battle because the scores were so high. (But) I'm hoping once the flood closure is lifted, we'll be able to get more places open."
Couture said it's shaping up to be a horrible season for the industry.
"The red tide was bad enough, but with red tide and flood closures staggering almost perfectly all summer, these guys have not had any work at all," she said.
A 2005 University of Maine study found that a one-week statewide closure in August would result in an estimated loss of $1.2 million for clam diggers and mussel harvesters, and an economic loss of $2.9 million for Maine's economy.
The closures this summer also are affecting dealers, retailers and restaurants.
"A lot of the restaurants have taken it right off the menus," said Bill Bayley, owner of Bayley's Lobster Pound in Scarborough.
Bayley and others have been getting clams from eastern Maine, where flats are no longer contaminated and clam diggers have been allowed to go back to work, he said. But, even with concerns about red tide driving down demand, supplies have been tight.
Clams are selling for more than $4.00 per pound, at least $1 dollar more than usual for this time of year. "It's the highest I've ever seen it," Bayley said.
Downs and other diggers were looking forward to getting top dollar when the flats in Jones Creek briefly reopened last week. But after missing a good part of the peak summer digging season, Downs said he's stopped watching the price of clams go up.
"It's too depressing," he said.

WATERVILLE -- It was the late 1970s. Eric Bloom and his band, Blue Öyster Cult, were on a small private plane flying to a show in Maine.
The first half of the two-hour flight was fine, a smooth ride. Then came dark clouds and lightning.
And chaos.
"We got knocked all over the place," Bloom said in a telephone interview Wednesday. "It felt like we were going up 1,000 feet and then down 2,000 -- in five seconds."
By the time the plane got below the storm clouds and was prepared to land, Bangor International Airport had had its power knocked out and lost its runway landing lights. The plane had to swing around and land at Portland International Jetport.
"It was the worst storm; the worst flight. It was pretty miserable," said Bloom, the band's lead vocalist, who also plays rhythm guitar and the keyboard.
Blue Öyster Cult (BOC) arrives in Waterville Saturday night to play a show at Champions Fitness Club at the Elm Plaza. The rock legends will be driving to Waterville, Bloom said.
The show will be the band's eighth of a 2009 tour that began June 3. BOC plays today at the Zeiterion Performing Arts Center in New Bedford, Mass.
Saturday's show at Champions will be held at the fitness club's tennis court, with capacity for 800 to 1,000 people. Bloom said he's looking forward to the show.
"I would prefer to play Shea Stadium," Bloom said, tongue-in-cheek. "I'm glad to play Waterville and party all night long."
What can concert-goers expect to hear?
"I write a different set every day; it depends on what kind of show it is," Bloom said. "The obvious will be there. It's the other songs ... depends on how long we get to play."
The "obvious" choices will certainly include BOC's most popular songs -- "(Don't Fear) The Reaper," "Burnin' For You," "Cities on Flame" and "Godzilla."
Bloom said the band did play a "fan's show" in New Jersey this past winter and played its longest set ever -- 27 songs over nearly three-and-a-half hours -- and the above songs were left out.
"We rehearsed and learned a few (songs) they never heard us play before," Bloom said. "You do have to relearn them."
BOC remains popular enough that the band continues to tour year after year; their last studio album, "Curse of the Hidden Mirror," was released eight years ago.
Bloom said the band doesn't have a record label and producing a new album is not in the cards because it's too difficult with the downward spike of the music industry, caused largely by digital music downloads, he said.
Other than his own band's work, what is Bloom listening to these days? Lykke Li, for one; she's an alternative, gritty Swedish pop singer with an independent label, Bloom said. Disturbed and Slipknot are among his favorite modern hard-rock favorites.
Bloom said the band sees a wide variety of ages at BOC shows, even though the height of their popularity was during the '70s and '80s. Bloom said he's seen entire families at shows, with the parents and children all wearing BOC T-shirts and headbands.
Indeed, many of BOC's fans are young people, Bloom said. "More cowbell" may have something to do with that, he admits.
The popular catchphrase comes from an April 8, 2000, comedy sketch from "Saturday Night Live" that spoofs a VH1 documentary of Blue Öyster Cult in 1976 performing their most famous song, "(Don't Fear) The Reaper." Actor Christopher Walken plays famed producer Bruce Dickinson. Walken interrupts the band's rehearsal several times and implores fictional cowbell player Gene Frenkle, played by Will Ferrell, to deliver "more cowbell" during the song.
"I gotta have more cowbell," Walken says memorably. "I got a fever; the only prescription is more cowbell."
The skit -- and the "more cowbell" line -- became notorious and continues to stick with Walken, Ferrell and, of course, Blue Öyster Cult.
Bloom, who is "a big car nut" and blogs for autoweek.com, recalls reading his post one day and seeing a response: "the car needs more cowbell."
Bloom remembers watching the skit live on TV that night.
"My jaw dropped," Bloom said. "You can imagine -- if I'm making a skit about your life. I thought it was funny later. When watching, it was a shock."
But Bloom isn't bitter; he's thankful.
"The cowbell sketch has been terrific for me. It's raised our visibility," he said.

Taking life outdoors in the big city

Full text: The Washington Post
WASHINGTON -- In the long tradition of American self-reliance -- that urge to eschew social conventions for a simpler life -- most refugees have headed for wilderness. Henry David Thoreau went to Walden Pond. John Muir to Yosemite. Then there is Paula Smith, who came to Washington about 20 years ago and has been pretty much living off the land ever since.
Not that Smith farms, hunts or freeloads. She is a forager and a scavenger. And among the assorted characters who roam the forests and streams of the Washington region and the Potomac River valley north of Georgetown -- a wilder place than many realize -- there might be no keener two-legged creature in the woods.
Smith knows when to look for fruit on the papaw trees, where the best oyster mushrooms hide and when the wild raspberries and wineberries are ripest. Also the easiest way to get free venison.
"I've eaten my quota of dead roadkill, trust me honey," she said. "As long as it's clean" and not too beat up, "I'll cut it up and eat it."
In a town known for backslapping bonhomie and double talk, Smith, 57, is brutally direct and totally unconcerned with appearance. Short, wiry and ill-mannered, she wears thick glasses and heavy boots and is rarely seen without her tattered bucket hat and a cigarette. Her salty language is as legendary on the river as her knack for finding deer antlers. Local outdoorsman Bill Heavey, a columnist for Field & Stream, once described her as "gruff and gravel-voiced," with "all the charm of a sawmill foreman." To many, she is the Potomac's unofficial riverkeeper.
"There's a lot of (stuff) that goes on in these woods that people don't know about," she said recently, at work on the docks at Fletcher's Cove in Washington.
Cleaning up garbage and litter along the river has been Smith's obsession for a long time. But lately she has been consumed by a new concern: Deer shot illegally along the river on National Park Service land.
"Poachers are going wild up there," she said, referring to the area south of Chain Bridge.
Poachers? In Washington, D.C.?
"I'll show you," she said.
To fishermen on the Potomac, and just about any weekend recreationist who has taken out a rowboat at Fletcher's, Smith is "the dock lady," running the boat rental program from a wooden shack stuffed with oars and life jackets. There, she works the angler crowd like a canny waitress at a truck stop, bantering with fishermen she calls "baby" and "honey" -- when she's not cursing at them -- and serving up shad and perch advice in turn for a little extra in her coffee can tip jar.
"We call her the empress of the docks," said Dan Ward, who has worked at Fletcher's Boat House since 1969. "Occasionally we get someone who complains because she has a bad habit of cussing in front of children, but she's worth the price of admission."
The boats are Smith's part-time job, an occupation reduced to a few days a week during the spring fishing season. But her full-time profession is in the forest. She spends most of her days alone on long peregrinations she describes as "just me (messing) around in the woods."
Deer antlers, old bottles, wild edibles and animal skulls are her pursuit on these outings, which can last all day and take her through Park Service land, private property and city parks. Because male deer shed their antlers at different times after rutting season, she keeps detailed notes to track their whereabouts. Over the years, she said, she has found magnificent antlers worth hundreds, even thousands of dollars, along with 19th-century whiskey bottles and rare coins. Twice, she said, she has called the police after finding human remains: once a missing kayaker, and another time the body of a drowned little girl.
Smith has no family nearby but lives in Arlington, Va., with Gordon Leisch, her friend and a well-known outdoorsman. Leisch, who is retired from the Interior Department, said he asked Smith to move in about 10 years ago to help him care for his dying father. Today their living room is kept like a large tackle box, overflowing with fishing poles, nets and other outdoor equipment. Wild game abounds in the freezer: hunks of deer meat, perch and turkey. Smith said she also likes squirrel and raccoon.
"Young raccoon," she specified.
"She's like no other you've ever met," Leisch said.
Washington may seem an odd place for this type of frontier lifestyle, but since Smith doesn't have a car and never learned to drive, she's pretty much stuck here. Most days, she catches a bus at 5 a.m. and transfers to other routes until she gets close enough to the woods to start walking.
"People think you're weird if you wander around in the woods," she said. "But that's OK if some people think I'm crazy. Most river rats are crazy."
Smith grew up in and around Chicago, and her hard-drinking father managed a trailer park for a time, she said. As a kid, her grandfather took her on walks in the woods. "He knew every bird, every plant," she said.
Smith said she left home for New York City before finishing high school, and for almost 25 years she worked in a printing shop before eventually running one of her own. But when she fell into tax problems and the business failed, Smith lost everything and came to stay with a friend in Washington. She has no children and never married -- "The one mistake I haven't made," Smith said. She showed up on the docks at Fletcher's one day like a castaway washed downstream in a storm.
"She asked for work, and originally I had my doubts she could handle it physically," said Ward, her co-worker at Fletcher's. Smith quickly proved him wrong. "She's the only employee I can remember who I have to get to work less hard. She'll get down on her hands and knees to get every little bit of sand out of the boats. She takes these things so personally," he said.
Smith quit drinking years ago, she said, but still smokes two packs of cigarettes a day. Just as there are certain fishermen on the river she doesn't care for, there are a few species she's not a fan of: Cormorants, which eat too many herring in her judgment; catfish, which she deems "nasty"; along with darn "yuppies" and their dogs, which harass the forest animals, she said.
Then there are her favorites: deer, of course, but also snakes, turtles and vultures, since she is just as interested in what's living in the forest as what has died there.
"Don't ever get too close to a vulture's nest," she cautioned this reporter, following her along the Potomac through muck and underbrush on the search for dead deer. "They'll vomit on you. And you don't want nothing to do with what they've been eating."
Washington's riverbanks may not be far from human settlement, but they can be wild and dangerous, Smith said. When the weather warms, homeless men set up camps in the woods. A few are dangerous, Smith said, and she is careful to avoid those she considers most unstable.
As she cut a roundabout path through the forest, Smith followed a pack of circling vultures to a rocky outcropping near Chain Bridge on the Washington side of the river. There, a pregnant doe had been butchered so recently that its discarded remains had no odor.
"You see this (mess)?" she said angrily, poking at a pile of entrails. "Since October I've probably found 20 dead deer out here. Most years I find one to six. I think they're taking them out and selling the meat."
Smith said that while there's an overpopulation of deer in the region, the animals are supposed to be protected on parkland. "I don't want no commercial venture wiping them out in here," she fumed.
Two wild turkeys appeared on the way back toward Fletcher's, and Smith followed them for a little while through the bushes, seeing how close she could get. She said the poachers would probably hunt them out by the end of the summer.
Of course, she didn't exactly use that language.

Full text: In her May 30 column, Rev. Susan Reisert asserts that the Bible does not provide a stable, authoritative mandate on marriage -- nothing could be further from the truth.
Quoting Jesus: "At the beginning, God made them male and female and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate." Matthew 19:4-6.
Anyone who claims to be a Christian and takes the Bible seriously is on dangerous ground when they use narrative examples of polygamy, fornication, etc. as proof to support sinful moralities. The Bible also recounts incidents of murder, theft, lying, adultery. Would you also claim that those are acceptable because they are "in the Bible?"
Such foolishness seems to be the hallmark of our day, when good is called evil and evil is called good.
An equally maddening mindset among Bible critics is the idea that Christians are hypocrites if they don't adhere to all the Jewish laws in the Old Testament (such as abstaining from shellfish). While there are many Jewish civil laws our country would do well to observe, the ceremonial laws (regarding kosher food, hairstyles, circumcision) were peculiar to the Jews, to mark them as God's special people. The moral laws (do not murder, steal, lie) stand firm, including God's definition for marriage -- anything less isn't intellectually honest.

Full text: Blue Oyster Cult to play at Champions
WATERVILLE -- The music group Blue Oyster Cult will perform at Champions at 9 p.m. June 20.
The concert is presented by Mountain Wireless, a group of independently owned regional radio stations.
Mountain Wireless has grown out of its current space in Skowhegan and will soon become one of the anchor tenants for the refurbished Lockwood Mills/Hathaway site in downtown Waterville, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
The concert celebrates the expansion, said Jay Hanson, co-owner and general manager of Mix 107.9, The River 93.5 and ESPN 1160.
"Our move to the historic Hathaway Creative Center was the next logical step in our community-first philosophy," Hanson said in a release.
To celebrate, the stations are throwing an open-house party on June 20 at Lockwood Mills for its listeners just prior to the Blue Oyster Cult concert. Concert tickets cost $25, and can be purchased in advance by calling 474-5171, or in person at Champions on June 20. Doors at Champions open around 8 p.m.
Reptile expert
in Waterville
WATERVILLE -- Andrew Wyatt, president of the United States Association of Reptile Keepers, will speak at 11 a.m. today at the Mid Maine Chamber of Commerce office at One Post Office Square, off Main Street.
The Maine Herpetological society is hosting the event.
The Reptile Keepers Association is a science- and education-based advocacy group for the responsible private ownership of and trade in reptiles, according to the organization's Web site. The association endorses caging standards, escape-prevention protocols and various conservation issues.
Fundraiser today
at Carrabec High
NORTH ANSON -- The Embden VFW Auxiliary is holding a special "Luck of the Draw" kind of a Chinese auction, fundraiser today at Carrabec High School in North Anson to benefit area veterans.
Doors open at 9 a.m. and the drawing is at noon.
"Come have fun and help us help the veterans," organizers say.
Admission is $2.50.
Maine revokes
surgeon's license
AUGUSTA -- A Maine board has imposed sanctions on two doctors, one of whom was stripped of his medical license.
The Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine revoked the license of Dr. Jaroslav Stulc, a surgeon who had practiced in Skowhegan but is now in Kentucky. The Portland Press Herald said the board found that he committed fraud on two licensure applications, acted in an incompetent and unprofessional manner, and violated rules on sexual misconduct.
The board issued a reprimand to Dr. William Tillman, a radiologist now living in Georgia. He was cited for failing to disclose information on his license renewal application.
Community meetings
in Waterville
WATERVILLE -- REM, the grassroots group dedicated to community revitalization, will hold its "Community Catalyst" meeting from 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at the REM Forum at The Center, 93 Main St.
The event, whose full name is "Community Catalyst: Check-up on Vision for 2020," is intended to evaluate the group's Mid-Maine Strategic Vision for the year 2020, which REM formulated in 1996.
"Now that we're halfway there, it's time to see how we've done and what we still need to work on," said REM director Faye Nicholson in a release.For information, call 873-4444.
Governor lauds
fallen officers
AUGUSTA -- About 100 people paid tribute to Maine's fallen officers Thursday morning during a ceremony at the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.
"The work of police officers is never easy," Gov. John E. Baldacci said. "...As a society, we need and depend on a well-trained police force to not only protect our lives and property, but also our rights as citizens of this great state, and of this great nation."
The service featured the laying of a wreath, the reading of all 82 names on the memorial, the playing of "Taps," and the attendance of state and local dignitaries.
"The dedication of the officers we honor today, their devotion to duty and public service, their recognition that justice thrives when all people enjoy the protection of our laws, fairly and evenly enforced, helped to make Maine a better, safer place," Baldacci said.

Some people struggle to pick a career, let alone "find their calling."
For Alexandra Desaulniers, of Rockland, she's known her career path for most of her life.
"Since the age of eight, I have known that I want to be president of the United States," she said. "During a tour of the White House, I gazed up in awe at each president's portrait. But I also wondered, 'Where are all the women?'
"I was shocked when my mother told me that there had never been a woman president. And so my determination was sparked to become the very first."
Now 20, Desaulniers is a sophomore at Colby College in Waterville and will be featured in a book, "She's Out There: Essays by 35 Young Women Who Aspire to Lead the Nation: The Next Generation of Presidential Candidates." Edited by Amy Sewell and Heather L. Ogilvie, the book hits stands May 12.
Desaulniers heard about the call for essays through The White House Project, a non-profit organization working to advance women in business, politics and media. The contest asked for girls and women to write about what their presidential platforms would be.
Desaulniers' essay reflects her support of government policies that help small business. Her passion for small business began when she was 11 and her father, a science teacher, began a 12 feet by 12 feet oyster farm on an estuary as a school marine biology project. The family decided the farm had potential and invested in its growth. Today the family has more than a million oysters -- some smaller than pinky, others up to three inches, the size they are harvested.
The oysters are appealing because they pump and clean 60 gallons of water a day. They aren't just a source of sea food, Desaulniers said -- raising oysters is an environmentally friendly business and is an efficient way of cleaning the estuary's waters.
"As a member of a small family aquaculture business, I have felt firsthand the impact of local, state and federal policy on small business -- the backbone of much of the nation's economy," Desaulniers said in her essay.
Her essay was one of 35 submissions accepted from a pool of more than 200 papers. Editors Sewell and Ogilvie chose 35 essays because 35 is the minimum age for becoming president.
Besides Desaulniers' ideas regarding small businesses, many of the essayists wrote about issues discussed in the 2008 presidential campaign, including the Iraq war, health care, education, immigration and the environment. Women's issues came up often and several young girls mentioned the circumstances of the 2000 Bush-Gore election as an impressionable time on their interest in politics, Ogilvie said.
"We judged them based on how serious and passionate the writers are about politics, and how well they communicate their ideas," Ogilvie said. "The best essayists link their political ambition to their personal experiences, have unique ideas for solving problems our country is facing, or intend to take unique paths to reach their political goals."
Desaulniers' experiences, along with what she's learned as an Anthropology and theater double major, is the foundation of what she hopes will be an industrious service record.
"Politics need to be about the people; starting from small towns to federal, we need to have a local feel," she said.

THOMASTON -- Rain or shine, each morning Alvin Dennison drives his customized pickup truck to his turnout off Route 1 in Thomaston and arranges the red, white and blue signs that advertise his wares.
Lobster, fresh mussels, clams. Shrimp meat, scallops, haddock.
Selling seafood from a truck on the side of the road is no way to get rich, especially this year, Dennison said -- but it's a living.
"If I work every day, I can still scrape out a dollar," the white-bearded Owls Head man said Friday. "I'm going to do this as long as I can stand here and shoot the breeze. I might have my wife push me around, but I'll be here."
Traffic whooshed by on the rainy road as Dennison, 61, weighed clams and bagged lobsters for his occasional customers. They pulled over despite the dreary weather and made cheerful small talk as they paid him in cash. "It's the best and the freshest seafood on the midcoast," said Don Gjertsen of South Thomaston, who has shopped at Dennison's truck for five years.
That truck, officially a licensed mobile vendor with the state of Maine, has been parked at the turnoff on Dragon Cement land for much longer. Dennison first set up shop there in 1993, a few years after the closure of his long-time employer, National Sea Products in Rockland.
The Vietnam veteran is a fixture on the coast, with regular customers and an inimitable sense of style. Weathered American flags dot the turnoff, and there is room in the jumble of patriotic seafood price lists for a hand-painted POW-MIA sign. "You are not forgotten," it reads, in stark white on black.
Dennison was drafted and served as a supply clerk with the Army's 1st Logistical Command.
"I came home from 'Nam in '69," Dennison said. "If I had known then what I know now, I would have been here in '69. You can't get a better job. I get to talk to everybody." In fact, he enjoys his work so much that he said he's encouraged several other people to get into the business. Dennison is happy to share some trade secrets.
"I'm a good gabber," he said. "Being a veteran helps a lot, too."
Dennison figures most of the area veterans have stopped by his truck. Generating a regular clientele helps keep him in clams -- of both the literal and figurative varieties -- as does the fact that his business has low overhead.
Most of his products come from Maine Shellfish Co., which delivers right to the truck, and he hardly buys anything straight from the fishermen. Dennison keeps his markup around 25 percent, he said, lower than it is at most stores.
It's not easy money.
"A lot of days you don't gross $100," he said. "I might make $25 or $30, depending on what sold. To make a living like I do, you have to work seven days a week."
There are plenty of slow hours, which he fills in the cab of the red Dodge Ram by listening to talk radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh. While 99 percent of his clientele know his politics, he doesn't put up signs in election years.
"Nope. I don't want to kill my business," Dennison said.
When asked about his best day at the truck, he remembered a New Year's Eve several years ago when customers lined up for hours in the rain, chatting together as they waited for their orders.
But then Dennison smiled behind his beard.
"I figure every day is the best day," he said. "I'm up, I'm alive, I've got my health."

Flame retardant, banned here, found in shellfish

Full text: Portland Press Herald
Flame-retardant chemicals banned in Maine because of emerging public health fears have shown up in sediment or shellfish in all U.S. coastal waters, including in mussels collected along the Maine coast, according to a new federal report.
Maine was among the first states to restrict the sale of consumer products containing polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs, over the past five years. The compounds now are banned or are being phased out in many parts of the world amid growing evidence that they are building up in the environment.
Laboratory tests have shown them to be toxic to animals.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, released a report Wednesday saying that PBDEs have spread to all U.S. coastal waters from only a limited number of areas a decade earlier. Levels of contamination are highest around urban areas such as New York and Los Angeles, but the chemicals also are present in remote and relatively pristine areas, including along the coasts of Maine and Alaska.
"This is a wake-up call for Americans concerned about the health of our coastal waters and their personal health," John H. Dunnigan, NOAA assistant administrator of the National Ocean Service, said in the agency's written announcement. "Scientific evidence strongly documents that these contaminants impact the food web, and action is needed to reduce the threats posed to aquatic resources and human health."
Mussels collected from three sites along the Maine coast -- Kennebunkport, Harpswell and Sears Island -- contained low to medium levels of the chemicals, according to NOAA.
However, experts stressed that the presence of the chemicals does not mean that shellfish are unsafe to eat.
PBDEs also have been found in other foods, including fatty meats and dairy products, and in household dust, which is believed to be the biggest source of exposure for people.
Scientists also are not exactly sure yet what effects, if any, the chemicals might be having on humans, or how much exposure could cause health problems.
"I certainly wouldn't, on the basis of this data, get alarmed about people eating mussels or eating shellfish. The stuff is all over our houses and in all the other foods you eat," said Deborah Rice, a Maine state toxicologist who has studied the health effects of PBDEs.
"We already know that they're in the food supply," agreed Michael Belliveau, executive director of the Bangor-based Environmental Health Strategy Center. "It's one additional piece of evidence that the food web has been badly contaminated by these chemicals."
NOAA looked at sediments and shellfish because both tend to capture whatever contaminants are in the water. Samples collected in 1996 showed the presence of PBDEs in a small number of areas, while samples collected in 2006 showed the chemicals virtually everywhere.
The NOAA study was the first to look at coastal waters. Studies in Maine and elsewhere have found the chemicals in human blood and breast milk, dust, wild bird eggs and seal blubber, among other things.
PBDEs are long-lasting, man-made toxic chemicals that have been used since the 1970s as flame retardants in a variety of consumer products, including building materials, electronics, furnishings, motor vehicles, plastics, polyurethane foams and textiles.
A growing body of research points to evidence that exposure to PBDEs might cause damaging health effects, according to NOAA and other scientists. Studies indicate that liver, thyroid and neurobehavioral development could be harmed by exposure to PBDEs, and that babies, who can ingest the chemicals in breast milk or in household dust, are most susceptible.
Representatives for a group of companies that make the chemicals could not be reached. The trade group Bromine Science and Environmental Forum opposed recent restrictions in Maine and elsewhere by arguing that some common forms of the chemicals do not last in the environment as long as others, and that there was still no proof that low levels of exposure present a health threat.
Belliveau, of the Environmental Health Strategy Center, said the report shows that Maine was right to lead other states with restrictions on the chemicals. He also said it shows the need for stronger federal regulation of toxic chemicals.
"We have a broken federal safety system that allows untested and known toxic chemicals to be widely used in commerce and dispersed in the environment and in our homes and in our bodies," he said.
Maine and others states also need to do even more, he said.
"Maine has done what it can to ban new uses of the chemicals." But, he said, "there's a huge reservoir of these chemicals in old products."
Bellieveau said state officials have begun talking about a program to collect and dispose of old furniture and other products containing PBDEs. Although difficult, he said, it would be easier than trying to avoid exposure through foods or household dust.

AUGUSTA -- Maine's forests, rivers and coastal waters -- and the communities and industries that rely on them -- all face major changes in the coming decades because of a warming climate, according to a University of Maine report released Wednesday.
Maine already is warmer than 30 years ago, with warmer coastal waters and earlier spring thaws, among other things, according to the report. And a much warmer and wetter climate is now unavoidable because of past emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, according to the study.
"It's a very complex and urgent problem that we have to deal with globally," said George Jacobson, a professor emeritus and a lead author of the report.
But, he said, "there is no way we can prevent the climate from changing a lot. We need to adapt."
Gov. John Baldacci asked the university to prepare a statewide assessment about a year ago, and a team of researchers from the university's Climate Change Institute presented the report to him Wednesday morning.
"It's a very sobering report," Baldacci said.
The report is the most ambitious effort yet to apply climate change projections to Maine's environment and economy, and it identifies a range of challenges, as well as some opportunities. It says, for example:
* Forests are expected to have fewer spruce and fir trees and more oaks and maples.
* Species such as loons, chickadees, lynx and moose could gradually be replaced by bobcat, deer and other southern species.
* Warmer ocean waters, together with higher acidity, could affect the health of lobsters and other shellfish, while southern flounder may become more common.
* Maine's tourism industry should prepare for rising sea levels that could threaten coastal areas, as well as shorter and wetter snow seasons and longer spring and fall seasons.
Baldacci said Maine will continue to lead efforts to slow global warming and minimize its impacts. But, he said, the report will help the state prepare and adapt.
"The effects of past emissions are already here and will continue to grow," Baldacci said. "This report is going to be one of the things that we want to constantly keep in front of us."
Baldacci said the report could be immediately useful to members of a task force that may soon explore adaptation strategies for the state. A bill to create the group is scheduled to be presented to a legislative committee next Tuesday.
More than 75 Maine researchers contributed to the report released Wednesday. Leaders of the effort said they plan to follow up with new studies focusing on climate change in Maine.
The report projects a 3- to 10-degree increase in average annual temperature over the next century and an increase in rainfall as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere gradually change Maine's climate. Those are considered middle-of-the-road projections and assume that global action is taken soon to reduce global warming pollution, according to Jacobson.
"This is not a worst-case scenario by any means," Jacobson said.
Among the projected effects, scientists say, a warmer and wetter climate will mean shifts in the plants and animals that live in Maine and coastal waters, including many that are commercially valuable. "The changes are significant enough that all of the species that live in Maine will be affected," Jacobson said.
Those changes will bring both challenges and opportunities, he said. For example, the spruce and fir trees that have fed the state's pulp and paper industry are expected gradually to be replaced by maple and oak trees.
"There may be opportunities for different kinds of forest products," Jacobson said.
Charles Colgan, a contributor to the report, said there clearly will be costs, such as rising sea levels and shifting river flows that threaten coastal communities and tourism.
"A lot of our economy is exposed to sea level rise and river flooding," he said. "The cost of being in risky places is going to go up."
But he also agreed there will be economic opportunities for Maine.
"I think when we get past the current (economic) crisis, the question is going to be: 'What's going to drive the economy in the next decade?'" he said. "And the answer has got to be, figure out how to fix these problems and make money doing it."
Paul Mayewski, director of the university's Climate Change Institute, said the report represents the state of the art of climate science.
While the overall global warming trend remains clear, scientists continue to learn new things about the rate of climate change and how it will affect different regions and environments, he said. The team of Maine scientists plans to build on the report with more regional studies that could help the state prepare and respond, he said.
"We will have no choice but begin to think more and more of these things," he said.
Mayewski said Maine, because of its natural resources, is in a good position to adapt and to take advantage of the economic opportunities such as developing wind power and other renewable energy. "We couldn't be in a better place," he said.
Jonathan Reisman, associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of Maine at Machias, was not a part of the research team and has been a more skeptical voice in the debate over Maine climate-change policy.
He said he could not argue with the science, but praised the authors for acknowledging that there is still much to learn about climate science and how it will affect Maine.
"This is at best a guess, albeit an educated one," he said.
And, he said, he wishes the state would also take a hard look at the costs of addressing climate change before promoting alternative-energy sources and other opportunities. While that may enrich some, he said, it will mean lower standards of living and less opportunity for most Mainers.

VASSALBORO -- On Tuesday morning, a small sign hung in front of the log cabin-style building, listing the hours: 6 a.m.-6 p.m.
The outside windows were covered with promotional posters for New England Coffee. Up the entrance ramp to the front door, another sign: "Over 18 only" -- and another at the door: "No cameras, no touching, cash only." A man in a white dress shirt kept watch at the front door.
Inside, two men sipped coffee at their booth; the rest of the tables were empty. There are 15 tables, with room enough for 58 people.
On Tuesday, inside were three topless women, one topless man and owner Donald Crabtree in a dress shirt and tie. Blue Oyster Cult's "Don't Fear the Reaper" was playing.
Brothers Dick and Rene Brochu of Augusta, ages 60 and 59, said they decided to stop by the Grand View Topless Coffee Shop after hearing about it from friends. Both men are retired.
"I really hope it works," Dick Brochu said of the business. "It's different. I kind of like it. If you don't like it, I say don't come in, stay away."
Implying that criticism of the coffee shop has been overblown, Rene Brochu said, "The evil is in your head."
To the chagrin of some residents, the shop on Belfast Avenue opened its doors Monday. More than 50 opponents turned out for Planning Board hearings in January, but despite complaints, town officials said there was nothing they could do to stop Crabtree from opening the business.
The coffee shop is in a former motel, which has been the site of many businesses in the last several years, and is located on a sparse stretch of Route 3 just over the Augusta line. It was most recently Mac Daddy's Pub at the Fat Cat Grille, which closed several years ago.
Eight customers -- all men -- stopped by the coffee shop between 10 and 11:15 a.m. Tuesday. Staff members estimated they had between 50 and 60 customers on Monday, despite a snowstorm; of those customers, about eight were women, they said.
Aside from the Brochu brothers, the other customers in the shop Tuesday morning declined to give their names or comment.
Topless waitress Susie Wiley, 23, of Farmingdale, said she went for the job because it's "something different" and said she's worked in coffee shops since she was a teenager.
Asked whether the shop is degrading to women, Wiley said, "No, I love it. I find it very empowering, not degrading."
For now, the menu at the shop is slim: Just cups of New England Coffee ($3 each) and donuts made from Chase Farm Bakery in Whitefield ($2 each). Crabtree said he may offer more food if business picks up.
Elvis Thompson, 32, of Brunswick, was the lone male waiter at the coffee shop Tuesday morning, though he said there are two other male waiters.
Thompson, topless and wearing black boots and black shorts, said he was laid off from another job two weeks ago and then saw an advertisement for the coffee shop.
During the first day, Monday, Thompson said he waited on two ladies, one of whom told him she had been opposed to the business but now she thinks it's great.
Topless waitress Kris Kelley, 43, of Windham, said her previous restaurant experience was managing a pizzeria in Hawaii.
Kelley said criticism of the shop is "ridiculous."
"It's just a body part," she said. "There are more serious issues to worry about in this country than something like this."
Kelley said she gets along with all her co-workers and customers: "We're one big happy family."
Contacted on Tuesday, resident Paula Furbush, who was critical of the coffee shop when it was proposed to the Planning Board, said she had not realized the business had opened.
"I definitely think it's not a good idea. I've lived in town my whole life and we've never had anything like this," Furbush said.
Lisa Breton, a resident for 23 years, said she was surprised the coffee shop opened up.
"I don't believe it's going to pan out, not in a small community like this," Breton said. "People move to these small towns because they don't want to deal with bars and adult video stores and a topless coffee shop. It's important for towns to have an ordinance written so things like this can't happen."
Crabtree said he does not pay his staff a regular wage; all their earnings come from customer tips, mostly ranging from $5 to $20.
On Tuesday morning, Kelley brought coffee to a male customer, who gulped down about half of the cup during a couple minutes, handed Kelley a $100 bill and left without saying a word.
Topless waitress Ginni Labree, 34, of Palermo, wore fluorescent electric pink nail polish and has a tattoo of a rose on her arm. Labree said she has previous experience as a store manager and used to work in dance clubs.
Although "most people have been respectful," Labree said she did encounter inappropriate behavior on Monday when an intoxicated couple came in. The male attempted to touch her, but she backed away. "I told them, 'Hey, we can't touch.'" Labree said she doesn't mind hugging customers or shaking hands.
Labree said she enjoys chatting with people and she has received many compliments from customers, such as "you're pretty, nice body, nice tattoos and you're very colorful."
"I haven't had anybody leave without a smile yet," she said.
Crabtree said he interviewed 150 people for the positions and narrowed the field to 10. Crabtree said he selected people who were the friendliest and comfortable being topless.
"We want to keep the girls respectable, not trashy," said Crabtree, who lives in the motel attached to the shop. "The biggest thing is keeping people happy."

This summer is already breaking records for red tide in eastern Maine, with the toxic algae even more concentrated there than it was during the record-setting summer of 2005.
And, experts say, a second large wave of red tide is lurking off the southern Maine coast, waiting for a shift in the winds to bring it ashore.
The state has so far avoided a coast-wide economic disaster like the one that hit three summers ago, in part because of an intensified monitoring effort that has kept more Downeast clam diggers working this time around. And state officials also hope the preparations will help the shellfish industry in southern Maine if the red tide spreads.
"It's still sitting out there, and we're only halfway through the season," said Darcie Couture, head of the Biotoxin Monitoring Program for the Maine Department of Marine Resources. "But we are very well prepared for it."
Red tide refers to blooms of Alexandrium sp, a microscopic algae that produces a potentially deadly neurotoxin. While the causes of severe red tides are not yet fully understood, the algae is always present offshore and becomes a health problem when winds and currents bring blooms onshore during the spring and summer.
The toxin does not harm mussels, clams or oysters, but it accumulates in their flesh and can poison people who eat them. Maine keeps toxic shellfish out of the market by shutting down shellfish beds whenever red tides appears.
Officials collect shellfish from various parts of the coast, grind up the meat and inject the juices into laboratory mice. If red tide is present, the mice quickly die. If the mice survive the next 20 minutes, on the other hand, shellfish in that area are deemed safe.
Although the mice test hasn't change since the 1950s, Maine's monitoring efforts have never been more intense or high tech.
The state is using a federally-funded network of buoys to detect blooms of red tide and serve as an early warning system. It also uses $143,000 in federal disaster aid from the 2005 red tide to triple the size of its monitoring staff, so that 12 people can visit the state's harbors and bays to collect samples of clams and mussels.
The effort, which runs out of funding after this summer, according to Couture, has allowed the state to shut down shellfish beds tainted by the algae while keeping open individual bays or rivers that have been spared.
"In eastern Maine, even though they're having a record-breaking year, they still have areas that are open to digging," said Couture. "Cobscook Bay would have been completely closed to digging more than a month ago" under the old testing program.
Julie Keane, a clam digger in Lubec, said the red tide this summer feels like a repeat of 2005 in some ways.
The state ordered additional parts of Cobscook Bay closed last week and warned that more closures could follow. "I think we're going be shut down entirely," Keane said.
But Keane is grateful for the buoy system and intensified testing because she's been able to keep working a few more weeks.
"I think the buoy system is great," Keane said. "They can only test so many areas. We have so many coves in Cobscook Bay. There's so much area to cover. ... We need to make some noise to make sure there's funding available to keep it going."
The intensified monitoring also has helped in southern Maine, where a part of the Scarborough River remained open for clams despite a general closure from New Hampshire to Cape Elizabeth.
And it helped the state reopen additional southern Maine flats this week, after testing showed a retreat of the red tide in Casco Bay and other areas.
Even with the monitoring, though, southern Maine would have been much harder hit had there been some strong onshore winds in the past month. "We're kind of coasting along being very lucky," Couture said.
SCRAMBLING AT RESTAURANT LEVEL
The combination of good luck and intensive monitoring also has limited the damage to the soft shell clam market, which is about to hit peak season on the July 4 weekend.
Although prices in fish markets and restaurants are higher than average, clams are still available, dealers said. Markets in Portland were selling soft shell clams for just under $3 a pound this week.
"I've seen it much worse at this time of year," said James King, marketing manager for JP's Shellfish Inc. in Eliot.
Although his company has so far been able to get plenty of clams from parts of the coast not affected by the red tide, demand for the July 4 weekend is sure to test general supplies, he said.
"I think there's going to be a lot of scrambling going on down at the restaurant level," he said.
Dealers said reports of red tide don't reduce demand because consumers know the state keeps exposed clams off the market.
"That's our primary goal is to protect public," Couture said. "With the extra resources we had this year we've also been able to lessen the impact on the industry."

Full text: It's high school graduation time, which means speeches from an important person wearing a funny hat and standing behind a lectern. No one invited us to give a graduation speech, but this is what we'd say if we were invited:
"Dear graduates,
1. Because you are 18 and full of yourself, and we are old and gray, you will ignore everything we say today.
2. But you're sitting there with nothing else to do, so you may as well keep your ears open.
3. That means taking the I-Pod buds out of them.
4. Sex, drugs, Amy Winehouse, American Idol, the Jonas Brothers and MTV's The Hills. Oh, and Madonna, Tila Tequila and Justin Timberlake.
5. We're not allowed to talk about those things at a high school graduation, but maybe now I at least have your attention for a moment.
6. If you wasted your high school years by getting by on the least amount of study, didn't join any clubs or play any sports and just "hung" -- all is not lost.
Tomorrow, you can cast off that identity and start again because the people at the next place you go -- college, a job, the service -- don't know that about you. You have a chance to make a second first impression -- don't blow it.
7. If you made the most of your high school years -- well, you're not like us. But we still like you. You can put your I-Pod buds back in you ears.
8. This is more for the parents: The worst is probably over. You won't believe how nice and considerate your annoying kids will be in about five years. You'll not only love them -- you'll even like them.
9. Graduates -- don't pay any attention to adults who tell you that you have to save the world, or the world is your oyster or any other grand platitude. Resolve now to listen respectfully to what we tell you (because that's good manners), but make up your own damn mind.
10. See No. 1.

Full text: Consider that the state of Maine is a business. In a business, you must do two very important things: Maintain your infrastructure and invest in your capacity to grow.
Over the last few years, Maine has done a poor job at both those essential tasks. For a variety of reasons -- political wrangling between the Democrats and the Republicans, lack of leadership and vision -- the state has not paid for the upkeep of its transportation systems and the upgrade and maintenance of its water and sewer systems. It has given only fitful and episodic attention to investing in effective economic development. A TIF here, a trade mission there, a last-ditch attempt to keep a mill open -- these are hardly acts that spring from a unified and systematic approach to statewide economic development.
Much of that poor record can be remedied if the Legislature can get past partisan politics and pork barreling for select constituents and accepts at least a version of the bond plan Gov. John Baldacci unveiled on Tuesday.
The governor has proposed paying serious attention to the state's infrastructure needs, with a bond package of $131 million for transportation and $20 million in water and sewer system upgrades to be voted on by the state's citizens in June. That's appropriate for safety and environmental reasons. It's also appropriate because, in the case of roads and bridges, it's more expensive for businesses to run trucks over poor roads and to take detours because of posted roads and bridges. And even the water and sewer system upgrades have economic development potential: In the case of coastal towns and cities, cleaning up their sewage treatment plants can mean opening up long-closed shellfish flats, which can then generate income for harvesters.
For the November ballot, Baldacci has proposed a bold program of investment in targeted economic development based on helping the state's own businesses and industries grow, not simply on going begging to out-of-state industries. That includes millions of dollars for research and development, which will support our state's budding industries as they attempt to compete in a global economy by devising innovative approaches to boat building, aquaculture and genetics, among many other fields. His bond proposal includes significant investment, as well, in higher education bricks and mortar. When there isn't enough classroom space to accommodate the growing number of students who need education and training to fill jobs, that's an economic development problem.
The economic investment aspects of Baldacci's bond plan are based on the accurate perception that Maine is transitioning out of a natural resources-based industry built on a small number of large employers fed by a blue-collar workforce, and into a new economy of smaller employers sprinkled across the state who need highly skilled and educated workers. That's been a hard reality for politicians and Maine workers alike to accept, because it demands radical change in how we perceive ourselves in this state. It means, essentially, that the opportunities that used to be there are diminished, and that it will take significant work, from government and individual citizens, to transform from the old ways of doing things into the new.
The bond package also includes investments in the state's environmental infrastructure, which lawmakers should seriously consider. With tourism an ever-greater part of our economic activity, the shameful neglect of the state's parks and historic sites needs to be remedied. So, too, the Land for Maine's Future fund needs replenishment if it's to continue its fruitful partnership with the federal government and private donors to conserve land that would otherwise be lost to private development.
As we have for months now, we urge lawmakers to set aside their historic differences and consider the larger future of the state when they take up the governor's bond requests. Certainly, there are many competing proposals for bonds -- by some counts, $2 billion in requests so far.
That leads us to the conclusion that it's no longer a question of "if" Maine should bond in order to take care of business. Rather, it's a matter of what we should spend that money on. In our view, it's time to invest in this state's future, and to do that wholeheartedly and with a determined, inclusive and progressive vision that can take us into a prosperous future. That's what the governor's proposal offers.

Coast wardens help protect clam resource

Full text: By DAVID HENCH Blethen Maine Newspapers
SCARBOROUGH -- Officer David Corbeau stares out over the expanse of mudflats that is his beat, trying to pick out the subtle signs of someone breaking the law.
What he sees are a handful of "the hardest working people you'll find," bent at the waist and wielding a heavy hand-held rake as they slice the fetid mud in search of clams.
Corbeau is looking for unlicensed diggers or those digging in areas closed for conservation or because of pollution, people who threaten the resource and the viability of the industry.
"Most of the guys in Scarborough, I have to give them credit, are pretty legal," Corbeau says. "People will still try to go out there and push the limits a little bit and we do write tickets."
This is the busy season for clamming and for the officers who protect the resource. Maine's appetite for clams swells in the summer tourist season, and so too does the temptation for a digger to take advantage of the high prices by breaking the law.
Unlicensed diggers are drawn to the quick payday, and unscrupulous diggers can reap a bonanza from closed flats without competition from those obeying the law. The closure of clam flats, because of red tide or polluted runoff, can also leave diggers desperate for income, particularly in the summer months when they count on making most of their money.
That's why towns up and down the coast employ clam wardens, officers whose primary job is to police the flats. Local wardens, working with Marine Patrol officers, try to make sure people are only digging where they're allowed.
"We're mainly trying to protect the public. We want people to continue eating clams," says Corbeau, reciting a fear shared around the industry that if anyone got seriously ill from tainted shellfish it could jeopardize the reputation of Maine clams.
"We also have an industry to protect. It's a shame we have to rely on licenses, but if we don't, the resource would be gone," he says.
When the tide goes out, diggers use their rakes to peel back slices of mud and pick out clams that exceed 2 inches. It can take as many as 1,000 clams to fill a 50-pound bushel. A good digger working in a good spot can pull as many as six bushels in a tide, though three or four is more common. In the winter, when prices are $40 a bushel, a day's work might yield $100. But around July 4, when the price hits more than $150 a bushel, the payday is much better. That's when the temptation to break the law grows. Licensed diggers will sometimes take clams smaller than the legal limit, or they will dig in closed areas. Sometimes a digger licensed in one town will dig in another. Or a digger with a recreational license will dig beyond the one-peck limit and add them to a commercial digger's harvest, doubling the amount of clams that can be sold.
Towns that offer commercial licenses - which can generate hundreds of thousands of dollars for the local economy - are required to have enforcement. Some have part-time wardens. Others have full-time police officers like Corbeau. His tools include binoculars, a skiff, a kayak and thigh-high boots, in addition to a pistol and emergency vehicle.
Clamming is more like agriculture than fishing in many ways. Clams must be allowed to grow to harvestable size, and some flats are seeded with small clams to increase productivity later. But the flats are also a communal resource and without management and enforcement, would suffer from overharvesting.
Towns sometimes close coves to give clams time to grow. Those conservation closures protect the resource for later in the year.
The state also shuts down coves for pollution, usually caused by runoff from heavy rain, or for toxic algae, called red tide. Clams are filter feeders, meaning they draw the microscopic marine organisms they feed on from the water that passes through them. That means they also can absorb contaminants like bacteria or viruses. Digging in an area closed for pollution is an arrestable offense, and wardens take it seriously. This spring, Corbeau, who has been shellfish officer for 11 years, spotted the telltale tracks of a clam digger on a flat closed for high levels of pollution. He tried for weeks to catch the person, finally spotting him one night. Corbeau called Marine Patrol for backup, then waited.
"We sat and watched the gentleman dig for almost four hours," Corbeau said. Wardens hesitate to charge down onto the flats after a suspect. A poacher can get away in a boat before a warden can navigate the soupy terrain. They also can dump a catch, giving the warden a harder case to prove in court.
In this case, the man was arrested when he returned to shore, charged with digging in a prohibited area, washing clams in a prohibited area, possession of untagged shellfish, falsifying shellfish tags and digging without a town license. He faces $7,000 in fines and could lose his state license. The officers dumped 187 pounds of clams he dug, worth over $250.
"Some people are opportunists," says Marine Resources Sgt. Rene Cloutier, who supervises enforcement from St. George to the Kennebec River. "You can go into a closed area and in half the time get twice the clams."
Catching poachers can require patience and knowledge of an area. "A lot of the closed areas are fairly remote, so unless you get out and start walking around and looking at all the nooks and crannies of closed areas, somebody could be digging there," Cloutier said. It can be hard to convince some people of the risks of digging in a polluted area, says Donald Card, a Department of Marine Resources biologist. "Some people don't believe in it. They think it's a big conspiracy," Card said. "They say they've been eating clams all their life and never got sick." Others just don't care, callous to the deadly threat posed by eating clams tainted by red tide.
Terry Watson of Phippsburg has been digging clams for 31 years and buying and selling them as a dealer for 25. He supports open enforcement rather than surreptitious efforts to catch law breakers.
"Visibility keeps the honest guy honest," Watson says. "He won't pick up the short clams. If he sees him out there every day, he won't go in the closed areas."
There are those who will disregard the laws when the price is right, he said. "They get away with it one tide and they've made their fine money and then they'll go until they get caught," he said.
Tim Downs, a Scarborough clammer who says he's been digging since he was 6, says the presence of a warden is the price for keeping the resource healthy. He says if clams from a closed area make a consumer sick, it would have dire repercussions for the industry.
A state analysis last year found that along the southern coast, Harpswell, Scarborough and Brunswick had the most aggressive enforcement. Those towns also invest substantial municipal funds in shellfish management, whereas communities like West Bath and Phippsburg rely on license fees to support their programs, said Card, the biologist.
Cumberland County Sheriff Mark Dion this year honored Deputies Andy Schenk and John Cross for their work policing Harpswell's mud flats. The town, which has 83 commercial diggers, got the state's highest rating in its annual review.
"I wanted to reinforce the fact that just because it's not what we perceive to be traditional law enforcement, it's absolutely vital to the community," Dion said. "Speeders in North Deering affect the quality of life but it doesn't impinge on someone's livelihood."

Considering Prof. Hawking's question

Full text: College classrooms, the bowels of the university library at 1 a.m., the New York Review of Books and French cafes are generally where philosophy gets discussed in our culture -- if it gets discussed at all. That's why it's such a refreshing surprise to find matters of the deepest existential import on, of all places, "Yahoo! Answers."
We speak of the Web site on which anyone can ask a question and anyone can give an answer. Bored sitting at your desk at work? Post a question and then see what breaks loose. "What's the youngest age of petrified wood?" asks one curious person. "Can God be separated into pieces upon request?" asks another. "What is management accounting? State the differences between management accounting and financial accounting." Er, was that a question? "If you don't like a question, do you still answer? Why?" Things can get pretty heavy on "Yahoo! Answers," though there's always the very matter-of-fact query as well: "How do I stretch a sneaker/shoe?"
Somebody at Yahoo -- presumably a philosophy major who found they could make a lot more money outside of the academy -- decided recently to invite some really important people to pose some really important questions on the Web site. So rock star Bono asks for suggestions about ending world poverty (an issue that has occupied his energies for years), Al Gore has requested ideas for reversing global climate change and, most profoundly, famed physicist Stephen Hawking has asked, "In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race survive the next hundred years?"
It's a question, Professor Hawking, that we ask ourselves in this business all the time. We're on the front lines of all the bad news -- if something nasty happens, we hear about it. In fact, we often dig it up. We're aware of the depravity of mankind, the illogic of our actions, our destructiveness, cruelty and foolishness. If there's anyone who's worried that there might not be a world as we know it a hundred years from now, it's us. And if you think it doesn't bother us, that we simply smile and revel cynically in all the bad news because it sells newspapers -- "Get me rewrite!" -- then you've got us pegged wrong. We're concerned.
We've had a week to read through the answers to Hawking -- well, not all of them, as to date there have been 23,068, which in and of itself is encouraging. There are the innocently communitarian: "We need to sit down and work together not fighting with each other." There are more sophisticated and jaded answers: "There are too many mechanisms at play, naturally, socially, politically, to completely fall apart," which somehow manages to sound world weary and optimistic at the same time.
There's the political answer that keeps cropping up, ignoring the longterm nature of Hawking's question: "Right now, we need to worry about the next two years until we get a new president." And then there's the surfer philosophy, complete with emotions: "The Human spirit will overcome :-) It's within us dude we're fighters and survivors. Yeah!"
And during this past week, we've also considered our own response to the question. As we write this, rockets are being lobbed back and forth between Lebanon and Israel. People in Baghdad are afraid to leave their homes; they're also afraid to stay in their homes. North Korea is trying to figure out how to send nuclear missiles our way; Iran is working deep underground to develop its own nuclear capacity. Hundreds of people are dead in Mumbai after a terrorist bomb. Red tide has closed shellfish beds on our southern coast, and our loons -- the thrilling and mournful voice of the North -- are suffering from mercury poisoning. We've just thrown out all our teflon pans for fear of being poisoned by them. If we don't do something about global warming, then parking lots along the coast could become shorefront property. How can the human race survive the next hundred years, indeed?
We don't have a complicated answer. This is an editorial, after all, not a dissertation. The answer has to do with our children. (It doesn't matter if you don't have children; even if you don't, you must have someone else's children you care about.)
If we're to survive the next hundred years -- no, if we're to thrive in the next hundred years, a more noble goal -- then we need a different guiding philosophy than the one currently at work in our world. Not the one that says we take the short-term perspective and grab everything we need and to heck with whoever has to pick up the pieces or clean up the messes after us. That's what gets us wars without end, toxins in our water and tunnels that fall apart and kill innocent people.
There's a phrase, erroneously attributed to a Native American chief, that says we must consider the consequences of our actions through the next seven generations. We'd be happy if we could demonstrate that humanity, as a whole, and each of us, individually, has begun to consider the kind of world we're making simply for our children. If we truly love and care about them, then we can't possibly hand them a world where diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis afflict a staggering percentage of people in the Third World; where we witness the devastating carnage of ethnic and religious wars every day; where our addiction to fossil fuels is making deadly changes in our climate; where corporate greed and malfeasance threatens the hard-earned retirement of tens of thousands of people; and where freedom and the right to speak our minds are threatened at home as well as abroad.
That's it, our philosophy for the day -- that we must be responsible to something, and someone, beyond our own self interest. Or to put it as our surfer dude friend on Yahoo would: "Yo! It's like, about the future, man! :-)"

Congress approved $5 million in federal relief this week for New England shellfish harvesters affected by last year's devastating red tides -- just as another round of algae blooms closed Maine clamflats.
The aid comes after some political wrangling on Capitol Hill, and as concerns mount about recent closures due to flooding and red tide.
"I think we're going to see a worse year," said RJ Mere, a member of Kennebunk's Shellfish Committee and a recreational clam digger.
The state banned shellfish harvesting in varying degrees from the New Hampshire border to Owls Head Light this week because of red tide. Some of the areas were closed earlier this year because of runoff from heavy rains that flooded York County.
Last year, the worst New England red tide prompted harvesting bans and restrictions that lasted more than a month, triggering a federal disaster declaration in late June because of economic losses in the millions.
John Lyon, 54, of Scarborough, a commercial digger for approximately 40 years, estimated he lost $20,000 in income last year.
"It's always something," he said.
Lyon said a "very, very, very small percentage" of harvesters he knows took advantage of the low-interest loans offered after the 2005 red tide, because the application process was too complicated.
"It's more to serve business owners," he said of the Small Business Administration loans offered in the immediate aftermath of the closures.
Money from this week's appropriation will go through two federal agencies and will ultimately be disbursed by the state Department of Marine Resources.
The $5 million aid package was approved Wednesday in the House and Thursday in the Senate.
The request survived a political challenge and "intense" debate that whittled it down from $20 million, said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
The request drew support from every senator in Maine and Massachusetts, the two states hit hardest by the 2005 red tide.
"It was a challenge. I heard at the beginning of the week that we didn't even have any money in there," Ferrier said.
The money was included in an emergency supplemental bill that also provided funds for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Hurricane Katrina relief.
It was one of 19 proposed spending items in the supplemental bill that Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. chided as indefensible "pork-barrel" spending and sought to remove in early May.
Ferrier said the New England relief proposal was slashed amid pressure to keep spending down. "We certainly understand that a lot of shellfishermen are going through some tough times," she said.

A shellfishing ban spread across most of the southern Maine coast this week because of toxic red tide, worsening what has already been a tough season for clam diggers.
The red tide closure expanded even as the state was lifting other closures that had been in place since last month's heavy rains flooded coastal waters with polluted runoff.
"Between the flood closures, all that rainfall we had, and now red tide, it's competing problems for the poor harvesters," said Amy Fitzpatrick, public health division director at the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Red tide is a natural algae that accumulates along the coast during the summer under the right conditions.
Clams and other shellfish accumulate the toxin and can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning if people eat them. The state monitors the algae blooms and bans shellfishing when levels exceed safety limits. "All the (shellfish) on the market are safe," Fitzpatrick said. But seafood dealers are concerned that if the present conditions continue, there may not be that many products to sell.
Over in Kennebunkport, seafood dealers are already paying more than $100 a bushel for steamers. Allen Daggett, owner of Cape Porpoise Lobster Co., said Thursday that he paid about $115/bushel this week. "It's starting to creep up," he said of the prices.
The red tide that struck Maine and other parts of New England last year was the worst in more than 30 years. Maine and Massachusetts officials sought emergency financial assistance for clam diggers who were idled much of the summer.
The Maine Legislature increased funding for testing so the state can act quickly, both to close and to reopen areas hit by red tide. Scientists have warned that this summer could be a costly one, too, based on the amount of the toxin found offshore.
Josh Philbrick, manager of York Lobster & Seafood, said prices are already a dollar higher than last year.
"Last year, our prices never really got above $4.99 per pound," he said. "The price is going to be as high as $5.99 for Father's Day Weekend," he said.
Given the amount of rain the area has received, Philbrick said, "personally, I think it could be worse than last year."

FAIRFIELD -- On the wall above the desk of Neil Colan, the new chief executive officer at Good Will-Hinckley, hangs an oil portrait of school founder the Rev. George Walter Hinckley, circa 1889.
Colan, 53, said Hinckley was the embodiment of all that the school and homes for young people stood for and continue to stand for, more than a century later.
"I do admire him -- that's him right there," Colan said, pointing to the large portrait. "I really do admire what a contemporary thinker he was on how to care for children. He also was contemporary on how to create a whole environment for children.
"He didn't just say put the kids in the classroom and be done with it; he understood the great value of learning by doing and to involve kids first hand in their own learning experience."
That experience, that sense of "I can do it. I can solve problems. I can relate to people. I know my role in the world," is present today on the sprawling 2,450-acre campus on U.S. Route 201, he said.
Colan takes over the top job at Good Will-Hinckley from the departing Gregg Dowty. He is the school's immediate past chief operating officer, having managed all programs and internal operations since June of 2004.
Colan first joined Good Will-Hinckley in 1997 as a member of its board of directors' Youth Services Committee. In 2001 he was appointed vice chairman of the board.
He said the expansive grounds, farm, fields, forest and facilities of the campus all add to the life and the vision at Good Will-Hinckley.
"This is just a great place for people to grow and change in their lives, which is part of our whole mission," he said.
Colan earned his doctorate in psychology at Boston University. He grew up in Oyster Bay, N.Y. and did his undergraduate work at Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y.
Before coming to Hinckley, Colan was a practicing psychologist and managing partner at Winthrop Family Pediatric Center and was clinical director at Kennebec Valley Mental Health Center in Augusta from 1995-2001.
He moved to Maine in 1975, landing a job as a teacher and counselor at the Community School in Camden and later at Hurricane Island Outward Bound School in Rockland before returning to graduate school in Boston.
He moved back to Maine in 1995 from Massachusetts, where he was associate director and adjunct professor at the Center on Work and Family at Boston University.
Colan said he is already at work expanding programs and services on campus. In particular, he sees educational services and family-based programs as holding the greatest opportunity to meet the needs of today's youth and their families.
"Our job is to provide the best services for children, youth and families who are in substantial need," Colan said. "Part of our new strategic direction is understanding the value of families in the lives of children and finding ways of expanding services to meet those needs."
Colan lives in Readfield with his wife Carrie, a social worker at Wales Central School and their children, a son 15 and twin daughters, 11.

Flooded residents and business owners around York County continued to clean up Friday as Gov. John Baldacci asked President Bush to get them assistance as soon as possible.
Four crews from the Federal Emergency Management Agency also fanned out across Maine's southernmost county to assess the historic storm's damage to public and private property. An initial estimate of the flood's public costs came to $7.4 million. Baldacci, who declared a state of emergency on Sunday, wrote in a letter to the president that more than 1,000 homes were damaged in the flooding, and more than 500 were evacuated.
The letter also noted that thousands of gallons of partially treated sewage were discharged from a treatment plant. "The flood event poses an immediate health and safety threat to thousands of residents and significant numbers of small businesses," the Democratic governor wrote in a formal request for speedy federal assistance.
On Friday morning, Baldacci toured flood-damaged businesses in York Beach alongside U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and Small Business Administration Regional Administrator Charlie Summers. Snowe said that local business owners are working around the clock to have their doors open in time for the busy Memorial Day weekend.
Also on Friday, the state scaled back its shellfishing ban along the flooded southern Maine coast. A storm closure was imposed Sunday as polluted runoff and overflowing sewage treatment plants dumped bacteria into coastal waters, making shellfish dangerous to eat. Officials lifted the ban on softshell clams between Kennebunkport and Pine Point in Scarborough after tests showed acceptable bacteria levels there.
The rest of the coast from New Hampshire to Harpswell remained closed, with bacteria counts in some areas well above the level considered safe. Some types of shellfish, including mussels and snails, remain off limits throughout the region because of toxic red tide algae detected before the storm.
A flood watch remained in effect Friday as between a half-inch and an inch of rain fell over the course of the day in York County, according to the National Weather Service. The forecast called for more rain Sunday, but not enough to spark concern that floodwaters would rise again.
Next week is expected to finally bring some sustained relief. "Monday afternoon through Thursday looks dry," said meteorologist Jim Hayes of the National Weather Service.
The flood's impact is still being felt on Intervale Road in Kennebunk, one of the hardest-hit areas in southern Maine. Yards, basements and some homes flooded there after the Mousam River rushed over its banks last weekend. Jere Gauthier, 65, said his family had emptied their closets in preparation for a yard sale, only to see most of the potential merchandise destroyed after about four inches of water entered their home.
The family spent the week in a motel, and Gauthier was busy Friday afternoon trying to get soaked area rugs off his hardwood floor. The work was tough: Gauthier has emphysema, the air smelled of mold and the wet rugs were heavy. "I do one little thing, and have to sit for five minutes," he said.
Gauthier said the personal items lost in the flood were of relatively little value, that he originally planned to throw them away until his wife suggested a yard sale. The wet hardwood floors, however, were a major concern.
"If I have to do something with the floors, it'll cost me a bunch," he said. Down the street, volunteers from The New School in Kennebunk hauled out furniture and smashed walls at another badly-damaged home, where the oak floors buckled after more than a foot of water entered the residence.
John Stultz, a carpenter from Waterboro who also helped, said the ranch would need new floors, sheet rock, and, possibly, wiring. Stultz said a few pieces of furniture could be saved, and it would take at least a week of work to get the house back to normal.

Biotech park's board struggles to pay on debt

FAIRFIELD -- The Thomas M. Teague Biotechnology Center, once heralded as the gateway to future economic development in central Maine, is in trouble.
Town Manager Paul Blanchette said the center's board of directors, which owns and operates the park, is out of money and cannot make payments on what remains of the $2 million the town borrowed to build the center.
Tonight the Town Council, in a special session, will vote for a municipal takeover to find a buyer or a new tenant. The meeting is set for 7 p.m. at the Community Center.
"You need to have tenants that pay in order to have revenue," Blanchette said. "Right now our goal is to try to obtain this building to try to get this building back on a footing where it's paying for itself, whether that means the town has to divest itself of the building completely and have another entity own it, or the town can actually make it work. We don't have answers to that.
"Right now we're more concerned with protecting the town's investment in the building."
Expected contracts and agreement with biotechnology researchers and universities never materialized, leaving most of the building empty, no one to pay the rent and not enough money to pay off the debt.
"The town is responsible for the bond on the building," Blanchette said. "At this point it does not appear that this group has the money to continue making payments on the bond."
In January last year, a contract reportedly was signed with the University of Maryland for the study of cold water fin and shellfish. Plans were to produce a commercial fish farm for such species as Atlantic salmon once the funding was secured.
The agreement last year with the school's Biotechnology Institute and Center of Marine Biotechnology was expected to bring freshwater research and development and a 20,000-square-foot aquaculture center to the Teague Center.
The plans did not materialize.
Other plans for other research companies to set up shop in Fairfield to date have not happened, either.
Blanchette said two things must happen before the transfer deal can be sealed: The council vote in the affirmative tonight and another vote by the biotechnology board of directors slated for Thursday night.
"It is our understanding that it will be done, that it will be transferred," Blanchette said. "The biotech group is going to transfer it to the town. They are in the process of doing the paper work to transfer it to the town."
Paul Tessier, secretary and interim treasurer of the Teague board of directors, said the planned move by the Town Council is putting the cart before the horse. He said there still is hope for the biotech park to enter into contract agreements with new tenants.
"I think that's premature," Tessier said Tuesday. "The board of directors will be meeting Thursday, at which time a decision will be made on what we will be doing. The options are to continue running the center or to turn it over to the town."
Clyde Dyar, who for now remains director of the biotech park and executive director of the Fairfield Economic Development Corp., referred questions Tuesday to Tessier.
Plans for a biotech park in Fairfield were unveiled to great applause in 1998. The $4.5 million park opened in 2001 and immediately landed a tenant, The Jackson Laboratories of Bar Harbor, which pays $30,000 per year in rent.
Voters in 2001 agreed to borrow $2 million to build the park as an "incubator" off Western Avenue. The town of Fairfield backed the loan, but the Fairfield Economic Development Corp., with Tessier as president, was paying the money back at no cost to the taxpayers.
The Teague Center board, which took over ownership and operations from the Fairfield Economic Development Corp. last year, has a payment due in May and another in November.
The May bond payment is about $51,000, Blanchette said. Of the original $255,000 in grant money from the state that was used to make interest payments on the bond, only $55,000 is left, he said.
Coincidentally, the November payment also is the first $25,000 payment on the principal of the loan. With interest and principal, the total payment in November is expected to be about $76,000.
"There's not enough money to make the November payment," Blanchette said. "The interest is running about $102,000 a year. The total debt currently stands at $1.67 million; that is the amount of outstanding bond."
If the transfer happens as predicted by Blanchette, then the taxpayers of the town of Fairfield will begin making payments when the next installment comes due in November unless a buyer or a new tenant can be found.
"It may have come time for the taxpayer to foot the bill," Blanchette acknowledged. "It happened when the voters decided they were going to back this bond; that was a commitment the voters made to do this, to take a chance on this and to see if this would work for the betterment of the town of Fairfield.
"The results we wanted did not occur."
Blanchette said he already has factored potential bond payments into the 2006-07 budget, which comes to town meeting in May.
Over the years the Teague Center's economic development partners have included the state Department of Economic and Community Development, Maine & Company, Maine Technology Institute, Central Kennebec Valley Growth Council, Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce and Kennebec Valley Council of Governments. The center also boasts "alliances" with BioMed Parc in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and BioCluster in Nantes, France.

GORHAM -- The Holsteins on Eddie and Becki Benson's farm on Plummer Road are among the top-rated in the country when it comes to genetics and the rich milk they produce.
But like most Maine dairy farmers, the Bensons found it hard to make ends meet just by selling the white stuff. So now they turn another product that their herd of 150 produces -- manure -- into black gold to help their dairy farm survive financially.
They mix the manure with shellfish waste and other organic matter such as leaf waste from surrounding towns, and produce earth products, such as a compost they call Surf 'n Turf. They sell the rich organic matter in bulk to nurseries and vegetable farmers.
Maine is losing its dairy farms at an alarming rate, said Stan Millay, executive director of the Maine Milk Commission, which oversees the milk industry in Maine. When World War II ended in 1945, the state had 5,100 dairy farms. In 2005, Maine's farms had dwindled to 358, less than a tenth of that number. And those farms are disappearing fast. The number of farms in 2005 was 20 fewer than the 378 farms the state had in 2004.
Factors include development pressures that drive up land values and taxes and the price of milk, which Millay said barely covers production costs for many small farmers.
That's why some dairy farmers are diversifying -- finding additional ways to create an income stream for their farms. Three Maine farms -- the Benson Farm, Smiling Hill Farm in Westbrook and the Barker Farm in Leeds -- recently each received a $15,000 state and federal grant to aid them in that effort.
The Federal State Market Improvement grants were a supplement to $25,000 grants the farms received in 2004, and enabled the farms to explore more ways to market their products, said Stephanie Gilbert, a farm specialist with the Maine Department of Agriculture.
Smiling Hill Farm, which had already diversified by bottling and retailing its own milk and other dairy products, formed a partnership with artisanal cheese-maker Jennifer Betancourt about two years ago. They have created Silvery Moon Creamery, a cheese-making business on the farm.
The Leeds farm is working on a plan to diversify by turning forage crops, such as feed corn, into pellets that can be used as heating fuel.
At Benson Farm, farmwork now includes working with the mounds of manure, dead leaves, shellfish waste and other organic matter heaped behind an old barn on the 500-acre farm. The Bensons use heavy machinery to move the various piles around to mix and compost them.
Becki Benson said they began accepting and composting the shellfish waste about seven years ago at the request of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, which was looking for a way to dispose of the tons of such waste that Maine produces. The addition of the Maine crustacean waste helps the Bensons market their product. "For some reason, people have a romantic interest in shellfish compost," Eddie Benson said.
The most recent grant money helped the Benson Farm improve the marketing of their bulk earth products, Becki Benson said. Eventually, the family would like to bag their earth products, which also include a loam-compost mix, so they can also sell them individually.
Eddie Benson, 48, gestured as he stood outside his barn last week toward his primary concern -- his herd, snug in their stalls on the chill winter day. Composting accounts for about 20 percent of the farm's income, but their passion is dairy farming.
"The whole compost business, I do that, so I can do this," Benson said. His family has owned Benson Farm for about 100 years. Becki Benson, 40, also comes from a long line of farmers. She didn't live on a farm growing up in Gorham, but her family kept a cow.
Benson Farm is known for its work in genetics and breeding, Becki Benson said. The farm has sold embryos to farmers as far away as Japan and Germany, she said. Eight of the farm's cows have been rated in the top 5,000 of the 9 million registered Holsteins nationwide, she said.
And when it comes to the milk they produce -- which is rated based on its protein and butterfat content -- one of their cows made it to the top 100 nationwide for protein production, she said. "That is really thrilling." Eight of their cows also hold Maine production records for milk and fat, she said.
Still, Eddie Benson said his family farm, which sells its milk to Oakhurst Dairy, can't compete with mega-farms, like one he knows of in Florida, that have 3,600 cows. The Bensons' three children, who range in age from 20 to 12, work on the farm and they also have two full-time employees and four part-time workers.
Diversification may have helped the Benson Farm and others, but it won't solve the problem of the vanishing Maine dairy farm, said Millay, of the Maine Milk Commission.
Not every dairy farmer has the skills to run another business such as cheesemaking and there might not be a market to support them all if they did, he said. "They can't all be Smiling Hill," he said.
"It's a good way for some people, depending on how they're set up, but it's not going to work for everyone," he said.
However, Gilbert said that for those that do succeed, diversification helps not only them but other agriculture-related businesses.
For example, the Bensons say their compost and other products benefit nurseries that use it and sell it and the vegetable farmers and home gardeners who buy it. Local communities now also have a place to deposit their leaf waste.
Betancourt, at the Silvery Moon Creamery, said that if that business grows, it could buy milk from other dairy farms. Also, she said, "we're always looking for goat milk and I would be very interested in sheep milk."
Gilbert said that when it comes to farms, "anywhere we can get more cash circulating, it's a multiplier effect."

Full text: By LARRY GRARD Staff Writer
WATERVILLE -- The man introduced as the "Wizard of Oz" in the fight against toxic waste told environmental activists Saturday that the regulatory system works more in the interest of polluters.
Peter Montague, director of the Environmental Research Foundation in New Jersey, was the featured speaker at the Sixth Annual Maine Environmental Action Conference at Colby College. Environmentalists from throughout the state attended the all-day conference at Lovejoy Auditorium.
GoodGrowth of Augusta won one of three awards presented for outstanding activism. GoodGrowth has fought the prolific growth of big-box stores in that city.
Montague, editor of the widely-read "Rachel's Weekly" environmental and health newsletter, said that the regulatory system falsely determines what is safe or has acceptable risks.
The system's method, quantitative risk assessments, allows industry to show that the damage it does is acceptable, Montague said.
He framed the problem as an "us versus them" scenario.
"The purpose of our adversaries is to get us into that regulatory process," Montague said. "It's their brier patch, where they're at home.
Environmentalists find themselves boxed in by the system, he said.
"It constrains us and confines us so that we can't get out of the regulatory box," Montague said. "It's time to get out of that box. It doesn't even have to be the only game that we play."
To get out of the box, Montague proposed, activists should focus "on the actor instead of the action."
He pointed to writing on the chalkboard, showing that 1 percent of the population owns half the private wealth in this country, and 5 percent owns two-thirds. The few control the many.
If communities controlled their own decisions regarding investment, land use and common assets, the world would be a different place. If workplaces were democratized, so that workers made the decisions and shared proportionately in the rewards, communities could become more stable and self-confident.
The New Brunswick , N.J., resident began by rattling off 10 signs of trouble, indicating that all is not well.
Among the bad signs:
n The cancer rate in Maine is 17 percent higher than the national average, making it fourth-highest in the nation.
n Four signs involve declining populations and disease in ocean life such as lobster, oysters, horseshoe crabs and cod.
n Plum Creek's plan to change the zoning of its Maine land holdings.
Montague described the Plum Creek plan as "an ominous sign from the viewpoint of preserving the Maine woods."
Closer to his home, Montague rattled off the chilling statistic that everyone in New Jersey lives within 10 miles of an Environmental Protection Agency Superfund toxic waste site.
"There was a workshop this morning about not turning Maine into New Jersey," Montague said. "I'm all for that."

School merger benefits not worth losing control

Full text: The Waterville and Winslow communities are being besieged with groundswell promotions regarding the benefits of regionalization. It is happening with fire departments, police and some areas of education already.
Merging the two school departments of Waterville and Winslow is currently being promoted by some as the elixir that will solve not only the financing of school construction, but also enhance the educational offerings of the combined systems. But at what cost?
The loss of local control by both communities will be the primary cost. Each community will no longer have the only voice in determining the issues regarding its "neighborhood school." Others will be voting on community-specific issues. Consensus, whether by a city council, town council or school committee, is extremely difficult to attain. Imagine the divergent views of this new "supercommittee."
Further, will the future members of this all-governing body be made up of representatives based on population? One person, one vote? If so, Winslow loses.
It is good to look for the oyster containing the pearl. But is it possible that we already have the pearl?
In my 16 years as a consultant in the Maine State Department of Education, I learned that, throughout the state, Maine people hold near and dear the concept of local control. That is the core of this issue.
I urge Winslow voters to support the referendum in order to maintain control of our own destinies.

FAIRFIELD -- A research scientist specializing in heart disease and stroke prevention has been added to the growing roster of tenants at the Thomas M. Teague Biotechnology Center.
Petr Paucek, a doctor of biophysics and biomedical research from the Czech Republic, comes to the Fairfield center from Portland State University in Oregon, where he served most recently as an associate professor in the biology department.
"He's going to be doing research here, applying for some grants and working in cooperation with other research labs and universities," said Teague Center Director Clyde E. Dyar.
Paucek said Tuesday that his specialty in molecular cardiology covers research into the workings of the heart and the causes and prevention of brain disease.
"Our research is to protect the heart and brain against ischemia damage -- stroke -- damage which occurs after heart attacks and brain stroke," Paucek said.
Paucek earned doctorates in natural science (biophysics) and physiology at the Academy of Science at Prague, Czech Republic, with training later at the Medical College of Ohio and the Oregon Health and Science University.
Paucek, 44, and his wife, a medical intern at a family practice in Augusta, moved from Oregon this year to a house in Oakland. His agreement with the Teague center is set to take place Nov. 1.
He ultimately will lease about 600 square feet of office and research space at an annual cost of about $10,000.
Paucek said he is working with Dyar to form a network of study and research teams.
"It's an incubator; it takes time to develop," Paucek said. "Our goal is to create a strong network with good universities and research centers; this takes time to put this together."
Negotiations so far have included talks on the lab surface technology program at the University of Maine and a possible collaboration with the University of New England.
Landing a research scientist with credentials such as those held by Paucek comes after an announcement in March that another research scientist, William X. Wang of Pharmacom Technologies, was moving into the Teague Center.
Pharmacom, with branches in the United Kingdom, Finland, Japan and China, specializes in the detection of infectious disease with a focus on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, known as SARS.
Pharmacom's research at the Teague Center is to be done in collaboration with the University of Maine and the Husson Research Institute.
Also in March, the center entered into an agreement with the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute for the study of cold water fin and shellfish. The Jackson Laboratories, the center's first tenant after opening in 2002, leases space at the center, which it has turned over to Kennebec Valley Community College for student training and research.
T-Mobile USA also leases space for the training of its employees.
Dyar and Fairfield Town Manager Paul Blanchette said the town is preparing a business plan for the aquaculture project with the University of Maryland, which has been proposed for land next to the Teague Center itself.
Paucek said he also has contacts with drug companies and bio-pharmaceutical companies, both here and abroad.
"I was today on the phone with executives of these companies, but I was advised not to release names," he said Tuesday.
Paucek said there are other connections in Europe that he hopes to tap, especially in Germany and Russia. He said he likes to think of Dyar and the Teague Center as the hardware to a successful program and his offerings as the software.
Dyar agreed.
"Dr. Paucek is filling a whole different role; that's the purpose of an incubator," Dyar said. "We're going to develop a network with laboratory researchers here -- research is a long term thing. His network tied with our network will give us success; I feel very confident of that."

Sea squirts cover bigger area of Georges Bank

Publication info: Morning Sentinel ; Waterville, Me. [Waterville, Me]14 Sep 2005: 2C.

Full text: PORTLAND (AP) - Sea squirts have been found on 88 square miles of the ocean floor on Georges Bank but the colonies were not as thick as a year ago when they threatened to smother portions of the ocean floor, researchers said Monday.
Mats formed by the invaders covered double the amount of surface as last year's survey, which was cut short because of bad weather.
Scientists monitoring the spread of the sea squirts fear they could overrun the ocean's bottom, covering everything from rocks to scallops and mussels. The mats could form a barrier between fish and their prey in the seabed.
Teri Frady, spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Woods Hole, Mass., said there's much to learn.
"We want to know the extent of the coverage. We want to know whether or not it's colonizing other parts of Georges Bank. We want to know if it's competing with species that rely on the (top) layer of the ocean floor," she said.
Sea squirts are tunicates, a filter-feeding creature named for its flexible outer covering called a tunic. They're found around the world, and they're not always a threat. However, the type of sea squirt called Didemnum found at Georges Bank off the Massachusetts coast tends to grow rapidly, and scientists don't know how to stop its proliferation.
The U.S. Geological Survey and University of Rhode Island joined NOAA in conducting the latest survey over two weeks in August.
Researchers found sea squirts in one area that covered 67 square miles and another that covered 21 square miles. There were no sea squirts at three sites in Canadian waters with similar seabed conditions, researchers said.
When they colonize, sea quirts can form mats made of thousands of individuals covering the ocean floor with the potential to overpower ecosystems and overwhelm valuable shellfish beds, including oysters, clams, mussels and scallops.
For now, it's more of a concern for scientists than for fisherman who're more worried about federal limits on fishing that threaten their livelihoods.
Barbara Stevenson, a fishing boat owner in Portland, acknowledged that sea squirts could become a big problem but they rank low on her list of concerns -- for now.
"Given the things we're looking at, I wish we were in a situation where it could rank high because it is a serious situation," she said.
Georges Bank is a rich fishing ground far away from waters closer to shore where sea squirts have been found for years.
But Didemnum cannot survive on moving sand, so the shallow Georges Bank crest is not threatened, researchers said. Also, it has not occurred on mud habitats that are typical of the deep basins of the Gulf of Maine, researchers said.

Protecting the natives

Full text: Exotic species of animals and plants are wrecking Maine's environment. But we have not yet reached the point where an all-out war has been declared to eliminate unwelcome species.
In fact, we put out the welcome mat for some exotics while condemning others, an inconsistent approach that leaves Maine's native plants and animals vulnerable.
Last month, France declared war on the giant Californian bullfrog, sending hunters into the night with night-vision sights, silencers and rifles.
"It seemed like a rather mean-spirited approach at first," said environmental campaigner Luc Gueugneau, "but we found that it was the best way of killing all the adults."
These huge, aggressive frogs were illegally introduced in France 37 years ago, as a joke, in a private pond. Growing to more than 4 pounds and nearly 2 feet in length, they have taken over ponds, lakes, marshes and gravel pits.
You might compare them to northern pike -- another large, aggressive predator that has taken over every body of water in Maine into which it has been illegally dumped.
But we have chosen a different path, deploring the abundance of pike introductions, but managing them as a new game fish that are highly prized for their size.
Addressing the problem of exotic species is difficult because some we love, some we loathe.
Two of the most popular fish in Maine are -- brace yourself -- not native to our state: smallmouth bass and brown trout. And we are about to go wild for rainbow trout, another non-native species that will soon be stocked in hundreds of Maine waters.
Adding complexity to the issue is the fact that state biologists stocked many waters with these exotics, then condemned anglers who took these fish to other waters where they compete with native species.
And it gets even more complicated when you get to species such as white perch, native in waters along the coast but introduced illegally all over the state where they crowd out native species such as brook trout.
If you spend much time studying the problem of exotic species, you would likely be very discouraged -- unless of course you like dandelion greens and hard-fighting muskies. One man's deadly exotic is another man's delightful dream.
A recent survey found sea squirts in Cobscook Bay, an exotic species that can overwhelm shellfish beds. Squirts have rapidly colonized already on the Georges Bank fishing ground.
"It's an almost scary sort of animal. It smothers everything that's underneath it," one scientist said.
Plants can be scary, too. Most Mainers have heard of the potential misery caused by milfoil, and we all know how prolific purple loosestrife has become. Hydrilla has been found in a pond in Limerick.
But hey, some people think loosestrife are beautiful, and when Acadia National Park staff tried this year to stamp out the exotic lupines in the park, the local citizenry almost tarred and feathered them. Perhaps we can agree that those Asian lady beetles that crowd into sunny spots all over the inside of our houses are darned annoying. Even worse, the Asian Longhorn Beetle is now in New York, which is too close for comfort.
We can also agree that the arrival of the Japanese rock pool mosquitoes to join their biting cousins here is overkill, given that we already have 40 or more kinds of mosquitoes in Maine.
Not all of these exotics have been illegally introduced in Maine. Some hitchhiked on our boats and motor vehicles. Some were brought by waterfowl and other birds. Many arrived on their own four feet. Possums and turkey vultures are now here, probably because of warming temperatures.
And I have not even mentioned coyotes, a non-native predator that has brought serious changes to the fields and forests of Maine.
In the future, we will be called upon to pony up big bucks to deal with some of these problem species. Most we will ignore. Some will bring us benefits. Few will be benign.
If you care about Maine, the Maine we inherited and will hand on to the next generation, you will educate yourself about the species of concern, heed the warnings of state officials to be careful of what you are letting loose out there and contribute to the causes that protect native species such as brook trout and landlocked salmon.
Admittedly, it is hard to take all of this seriously when we choose to label some exotics as desirable and others as demons.
I guess value is in the eye of the beholder. But if more Mainers do not place a higher value on our native species of plants and animals, future generations will only read about them in books.

Full text: MACHIAS (AP) -- While their parents harvested blueberries under the hot sun, the children of migrant workers enjoyed a mix of learning fun, including reading and math skills, at the Blueberry Harvest School.
The federally funded program held this year at the University of Maine at Machias attracted a total of 180 children before it ended Friday, said a state official.
director Nora Murray, who administers migrant education programs through the Maine Department of Education.
The three-week program provided academic and recreational opportunities for children ages 3 to 13 while their parents worked the fields.
About 80 percent of the children and their families came from MicMac reservations in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, she said.
Many of the other families will move on to the next agricultural opportunity, or else return to their homes in Mexico or other Spanish-speaking countries. Migrant families also came for this summer's harvest from Florida, Texas, Mississippi and Wisconsin.
Relocating the summer program to the UMM campus, after several years amid other sites in Harrington, Cherryfield and Steuben, had rewards beyond anyone's expectations.
The children used the pool daily at the university's Center for Lifelong Learning. They enjoyed breakfast and lunch in UMM's dining hall, where food choices were plentiful. Salad and taco bars were popular, and fruit and healthful snacks were always available.
All-you-can-eat pizza was a hit early in the program, when the staff held an open house on campus one evening for teenagers, adults and families.
The older children, the 12- and 13-year-olds who spent the full three weeks on campus, interacted with two of UMM's professors. Artist Gene Henderson taught them sculpture. Marine biologist Gayle Krause took them on field trips to tidal pools in Roque Bluffs and the shellfish hatchery on Beals Island.
Those who wanted tours of the campus got to see classrooms and dormitory rooms.
Everyone heard about opportunities to attend college, whether they end up at UMM or somewhere else. Few of the parents and adults had ever been on a college campus, Murray said, so it made for an evening of many layers.
"Research shows that visits to college campuses by kids makes a difference," Murray said. "We are so appreciative that we could use the UMM campus this summer."

Full text: FAIRFIELD -- All it took for Penny Harkins to become hooked on saltwater aquarium marine life was to see her first saltwater fish.
She was shopping for fish for her daughter's freshwater aquarium three years ago, and happened upon a Humu Trigger, a beautiful white fish with black and gray markings, which comes from the Indo-Pacific and western coast of Africa."
"He was dancing in front of the glass," Harkins recalled. "It looked to me like he was saying, 'Take me home, take me home.' I said, 'Oh, my God, I've got to have him.' So, I took him home."
For the next three years, Harkins bought saltwater fish and corals, live rocks, sponges and anemones -- and read everything she could get her hands on about them.
Recently, she opened Mainely Marine, a business at 95 Nyes Corner Drive that specializes in saltwater aquariums, supplies and service.
"I believe that Mainely Marine is the only 'pet store' in this state, and possibly New England, which specializes solely in aquariums and devotes approximately 90 percent to saltwater and 10 percent to freshwater," Harkins said at the store Thursday.
"The fish are different. They are more colorful. You just can't believe they grow in the wild like that."
The store offers saltwater life that includes more than 200 varieties of fish, seahorses, starfish, jellyfish, live rock and sand, mollusks, crabs, shrimp, urchins, corals and anemones.
"I buy only from reputable suppliers who -- like myself -- do not promote the use of drugs in the capture of live stock," she said.
On a tour through her store, Harkins points to a variety of sea life in her aquariums.
"This is a soft coral called, 'Red Chile Coral," she said, pointing it out. "The little guy on the piece of cured coral is a Coral-banded Shrimp."
An elegant yellow, blue and orange fish -- a Queen Angel from the Pacific Ocean -- swims next to the glass as she passes by. At another aquarium, three long, little fish with black and white stripes swim together.
"They ate Coral Catfish. They have to be sold in groups of three, or they get out of funk and they won't eat," Harkins says.
She also sells some freshwater fish, including Pican Knives and Elephant Nose, the latter of which has an elongated snout.
"They communicate with each other through electrical impulse," she says of the fish.
A Banded Shark, marked by bands of color, is a newcomer to the shop, arriving the day before, she said.
The saltwater fish come not only from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, but also from the Red Sea, Mediterranean, Indian Ocean -- any ocean that is warm.
Her store is located 5 miles north of I-95's Exit 36, off U.S. Route 201, or two miles south of the Hinckley Bridge, also off that route.
"The people who have found the store are ecstatic because, finally, they can go to one place that offers them anything they want for good prices and definitely good customer service," she said.
The store is open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. Customers may call or fax Harkins at 453-2810.

Full text: FAIRFIELD -- All it took for Penny Harkins to become hooked on saltwater aquarium marine life was to see her first saltwater fish.
She was shopping for fish for her daughter's freshwater aquarium three years ago, and happened upon a Humu Trigger, a beautiful white fish with black and gray markings, which comes from the Indo-Pacific and western coast of Africa."
"He was dancing in front of the glass," Harkins recalled. "It looked to me like he was saying, 'Take me home, take me home.' I said, 'Oh, my God, I've got to have him.' So, I took him home."
For the next three years, Harkins bought saltwater fish and corals, live rocks, sponges and anemones -- and read everything she could get her hands on about them.
Recently, she opened Mainely Marine, a business at 95 Nyes Corner Drive that specializes in saltwater aquariums, supplies and service.
"I believe that Mainely Marine is the only 'pet store' in this state, and possibly New England, which specializes solely in aquariums and devotes approximately 90 percent to saltwater and 10 percent to freshwater," Harkins said at the store Thursday.
"The fish are different. They are more colorful. You just can't believe they grow in the wild like that."
The store offers saltwater life that includes more than 200 varieties of fish, seahorses, starfish, jellyfish, live rock and sand, mollusks, crabs, shrimp, urchins, corals and anemones.
"I buy only from reputable suppliers who -- like myself -- do not promote the use of drugs in the capture of live stock," she said.
On a tour through her store, Harkins points to a variety of sea life in her aquariums.
"This is a soft coral called, 'Red Chile Coral," she said, pointing it out. "The little guy on the piece of cured coral is a Coral-banded Shrimp."
An elegant yellow, blue and orange fish -- a Queen Angel from the Pacific Ocean -- swims next to the glass as she passes by. At another aquarium, three long, little fish with black and white stripes swim together.
"They ate Coral Catfish. They have to be sold in groups of three, or they get out of funk and they won't eat," Harkins says.
She also sells some freshwater fish, including Pican Knives and Elephant Nose, the latter of which has an elongated snout.
"They communicate with each other through electrical impulse," she says of the fish.
A Banded Shark, marked by bands of color, is a newcomer to the shop, arriving the day before, she said.
The saltwater fish come not only from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, but also from the Red Sea, Mediterranean, Indian Ocean -- any ocean that is warm.
Her store is located 5 miles north of I-95's Exit 36, off U.S. Route 201, or two miles south of the Hinckley Bridge, also off that route.
"The people who have found the store are ecstatic because, finally, they can go to one place that offers them anything they want for good prices and definitely good customer service," she said.
The store is open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. Customers may call or fax Harkins at 453-2810.
