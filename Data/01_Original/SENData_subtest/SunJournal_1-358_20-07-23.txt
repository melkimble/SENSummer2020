Souperishing! (from 1920’s Great Irish Famine)…1890 to now…

It is so cold outside and with the first breath of cold air weather, cooks start thinking about new and wonderful soups. As you sit down to a nice bowl of hot soup, have you ever wondered about the history of soup? The exact roots are unknown, but many historians feel that where many locations that claim “soup” as their own. The art, combining various ingredients into a large pot to create a nutritious, filling, easy digested simple food is inevitable. It is the perfect choice for sedentary and traveling cultures, rich and poor, healthy and ill. Soups have evolved around regions, availability of ingredients and healthy proportions. The history is as old as the art of cooking.
Webster’s Dictionary defines “soup” as “a liquid having a base, a meat, fish or vegetable stock, being clear or thickened to a consistency of a puree, or having milk or cream added, and often containing pieces of solid food, such as meat, shellfish, pasta and an array of vegetables.”
Commonly known Fannie Farmer Cookbook puts it this way: “Soup may be thick or thin, hot or cold, subtle or spicy, jellied, pureed, or creamed. It may be as clear as glass or full of chunky bits of vegetables and meats. Some soups derive their essential flavors from a rich stock: others depend on milk or water to capture the pure taste of the ingredients. Certain soups can be cooked in thirty minutes (some do not even take cooking), but others require hours of slow simmering and taste better when they’ve been left to “mellow” in the refrigerator overnight.”
There are several types of soups: bisques, borsch, bouillabaisse, consommé, gazpacho, minestrone, vichyssoise, as well as stews and chowders. The FF cookbook does not define a stew, but Webster’s describes stew as “food prepared by stewing (to boil slowly or with a simmering heat) in liquid (as water or milk); especially: a combination of fish or meat usually with vegetables prepared in this way.” Chowder is a soup or stew of seafood, clams or white fleshed sea fishes, usually made with milk, cream and containing salt pork or bacon, onions and potatoes and sometimes-other vegetables.
Technological advancements starting back in the 1800’s allowed “soup” to take the many forms it has through the ages regionally, nationally and historically. For example, as in the title of this column, “Souperishing” refers to the practice of Bible societies during the Irish Great Famine, feeding the hungry in exchange for religious instruction.
This is a “recipe to repeat” and add to your meal rotation.
Slow Cooker Beef and Lentil Soup
25 minutes for prep. 8 hours cook time
2 tbsp. olive oil, divided
1 pound boneless beef, chuck, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
1/3 cup red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon works well)
1 cup chopped celery
1 cup thinly sliced leeks, or use onions
1 cup thinly sliced, peeled carrot
1 tsp. minced garlic (or more to taste, because we love garlic!)
3 cups beef broth (recommended, canned or boxed, or 2 pkgs. of beef dry onion soup)
3-4 cups water (start with 3)
1 14.5-ounce can petite diced tomatoes
1 cup dried lentils (or barley)
1 bay leaf
3 cups fresh spinach, stems trimmed and discarded (Swiss chard with no ribs and chopped works well too).
1 tbsp. chopped fresh oregano (or switch it up and use Herbs de Provence, mixed herbs)
Salt and pepper, to taste.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet, over medium heat, and brown beef on all sides, 6-7 minutes. Add wine to deglaze the skillet, scraping all those yummy brown bits from the bottom (flavor, flavor!). Put meat and juice into your slow cooker.
Wipe your pan out with a paper towel, add olive oil, heat to medium. Add celery, leeks, and carrots to the skillet and cook, until vegetables soften, about 4-5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, cook and stir another minute and transfer to the slow cooker. Add broth, water, tomatoes, lentils and bay leaf, cover and cook on low for 7-8 hours or on high for 3 1/2 to 4 hours.
When you are ready to serve your soup, remove the bay leaf, and stir in the spinach and oregano, taste and add salt and pepper to taste.
Serve with large crusty bread, 4 servings.

Souperishing, Part 2
“Soup is to the meal, what the hostess’s smile of welcome is to the party…~A prelude to the goodness to come.”~
~Louis P. De Gouy
Soup making is older than it is thought to be known. There is evidence of existence far back as the Stone Age. Boiling was not a common cooking technique until the invention of a waterproof vessel or container in the form of rock or clay, animal hides, bark or reed baskets used to form the vessel. Cooking was done on hot rocks as wood was not commonly used, thinking the components of trees or shrubs was more in thought of a plant used for nutrition.
The word “soup” comes from French Soupe, (“Soup-Broth”) which comes through Vulgan Latin “Suppa,” meaning bread soaked in broth, or from a Germanic source also “Sop.” in which a piece of bread used to soak up a thick or fluid liquid.
Soups’ main ingredients are characterized as liquid (stock, juice, water), combining meat and or vegetables and other delightful ingredients in many variations of flavors.
In traditional French cuisine, soups are classified into two groups. The established French classification of clear soup includes bouillon and consommé, and the thick soups depending on the thickening agent used, such as starch in purees, creams with béchamel sauce and volutes thickened with eggs, butter or cream. This opened the doors to many colonies using what they had available to them and creating their own special brand, style or flavor of soup. Many of the modern soups made nowadays include a diversity of ingredients from the garden, and combination of flavor profiles that now include the use of pumpkin, carrots, squash, sweet potatoes etc., and are in close resemblances to stews, or “stoops,” as we call them.
First used in Paris, the word “rest-orstifs” (something restoring) referred to a highly concentrated, inexpensive soup, (pot-au-feu) sold by street vendors that was advertised as an antidote to physical exhaustion and ailments. In 1765, a Parisian entrepreneur opened a shop specializing in such soups. This prompted the use of the modern word “restaurant” as an eating establishment.
Meanwhile, in the U.S., the first colonial cookbook was published in 1742 by William Parks in Virginia. This, based on “The Accomplished Gentlemen’s Companion,” included several recipes for soups and bisques that immigrants from other countries and nationalities “gifted” to America, introducing a serious list of types of soups, including Vietnamese, Polish, Italian, Jewish, Hungarian, Mediterranean to Mexican, Greek and on and on.
In the very late 1800’s, Dr. John T. Dorrance, was a chemist who invented the method of producing concentrated food by adding water or milk. Making giant leaps forward in the soup game, soon Dr. Dorrance and Campbell Soup capitalized on this discovery and, by 1911, they received national distribution and acclaim and soon there were advancements in manufacturing and science and increased product availability. Soups leaped into much popularity and this enabled soup to become a sensation, making Campbell’s a household name. This didn’t discourage the home chef, who still made delicious soups.
The following recipe is taken from the French era, of the thick soup category, fresh vegetables and Poulet simmered in a creamy and fresh tasting, filling soup for any night of the week. Enjoy this marvelous chowder.
Chicken and Corn Chowder
15 Minutes prep time, cook time 8 hours in a crockpot
4 slices bacon diced
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs cut into 1 inch cubes
12 ounces diced red potatoes
1 lg. onion diced
3 carrots. peeled and diced
2 lg. stalks celery diced
2 cups corn kernel, frozen or canned
4 cups chicken broth
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp. thyme
1/2 tsp. oregano
1/2 tsp. paprika
1 bay leaf
Salt and pepper, to taste
2 tbsp. butter
2 tbsp. corn starch
2 tbsp. chopped chives
Heat a large skillet over med. high, cook bacon until brown and set aside, when cool, chop finely.
Place chicken in frying pan, brown all sides, and place into crock pot. Put celery, onions, carrots, garlic in frying pan and cook slightly for 5-6 minutes. Wisk flour or corn starch with 1/2 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 and stir to make roux, 3-4 minutes. Remove and pour into crock pot, add diced potatoes and corn, add broth, thyme, oregano, bay leaf, season lightly with salt and pepper.
Cover and cook on low heat for 8 hours or high heat for 4 hours. When potatoes are cooked, add remainder of half and half, butter (during last 30 minutes of cooking). Stir gently and add chives and more chopped bacon if on hand and serve immediately.
8 servings

Souperishing, Part 3
“One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.” — James Beard
Since the 1990’s, the can soup market developed rapidly, mostly due to the fact that the “1940’s moderned” housewife, representing the majority of American consumers of the decade, could add a little liquid to prepare something ready to eat right away instead of spending a couple hours dicing, chopping and making broth.
Canned soup was marketed as economical and easy to prepare, offering “convenience” and making it a popular choice for lunch. The most fashionable canned soups in America included chicken noodle, tomato, and cream of mushroom. Today, we consume more than 2.5 billion bowls of these choices alone yearly.
Dried soup mixes were thought to have been more a discovery than an invention. Egyptians used the desert temperature and sun to dry their food sources until the Middle Ages, when Europeans were designing the building blocks to specifically dehydrate food to keep it from spoiling. At this point in history, thanks goes to French inventors, Masson and Chollet. They developed a mechanized process of drying food with air and compressing it into cakes or particles. Now, that may not sound palatable to us, but was very welcomed to sailors and combat troops, during World War II as a welcomed source of nutrition.
American housewives would have nothing to do with dried food and its rebirth was not recognized until the 60’s, when campers and hikers threw it into their backpacks and were able to provide themselves proper nutrition while on the trail, on a boat excursion or camping in the remote woods. The military continued and perfected the use of freeze dried food packs, popularizing “MREs,” to feed the troops outside base.
The development of scientific and technological advancements allowed soup to take on many forms such as canned, microwavable, instant, western-style, dehydrated, boxed, all portable and easy to prepare. After the 1960’s, canned soup became common in the kitchen pantry. In late 1980’s, almost all regions and nationalities shared many variations and recipes using canned soups or broths, maintaining their popularity. History confirms children as well as adults eating alphabet soup have fun making words with the little letters. It was said that parents thought their children were extremely gifted because they were”soup word spelling” at early ages.
As a common example of American cuisine, soup is now described as comfort food. Specialized soups in 2016 can be accounted for a 35-40% margin in restaurants across the country, with almost 30 different categories of soups.
Soup stands alone as a meal or often complements a meal. A big pot of soup on the stove, filling the house with wonderful aroma is healthy and filling. Whether you open a can or make homemade soup, it is and always will be part of our everyday lives.
This soup is one of Mama’s favorites, it is one of those recipes you can sit down to and eat as much and often as you want and feel great! It is flavorful, low in calories, packed with vegetables, reheats well, and is perfect at any time.
Cabbage Soup
1 1/2 tbsp. olive oil
1 small head of green cabbage, roughly chopped
3-4 carrots, sliced or diced, your preference
3 celery stalks, sliced or diced
1 med/lg. onion, sliced or diced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 cups of frozen or fresh green beans
1 (14.5 oz.) can petite diced tomatoes
6 cups chicken broth plus 1 cup of water
(If you are making a beef cabbage soup, then you would use the broth from your beef cut, or use the 6 cups of beef broth and 1 cup of water.)
2 tsp. Italian seasoning
Salt and pepper, to taste
3 tbsp. minced fresh parsley
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sautee onions, carrots and celery for about 6 minutes, add the garlic and stir one more minute. Stir in cabbage, green beans, broth, seasoning and lightly season with salt and pepper. Bring to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until veggies are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Season to taste, add parsley and serve warm. For meat version, you can use ground beef, or cook shank bones, neck bones, cubes beef stew. Cook your meat tender before adding all your vegetables. Enjoy!

Full text: AREA — On Wednesday, October 16, the Mahoosuc Land Trust sponsored a natural history program, presented by the Chewonki Foundation of Wiscasset, for Crescent Park and Woodstock Elementary fourth graders. The students rotated through three hour-long presentations: Animal Adaptations, Maine Mammals, and Tide Pools. The kids got to pet a large snake; try on costumes, such as lobster claws and fish fins; and touch or hold mussels, crabs, and oysters.

I have written a lot of articles about this pond, but this will be my last. I can best describe it as an incredible natural trout pond nestled in the western mountains. There has never been a stocked trout put in it. The trout are fire engine red and the best tasting trout I have ever had. I first went there when I was nine Years old—so I know the pond. I have caught more trout in that pond over my life than all the other trout waters I have fished combined. It was that good.
I headed in in July of this year. The water was high for July but I immediately noticed that it had that chocolate look which meant it was healthy. As I have told you before, great trout waters are not crystal clear. Fish in Labrador and you will be fishing in water that has life suspended in it. I don’t know exactly what it is—in the ocean it would be plankton. So all seemed good as I headed out to my fishing spot. The spot is actually a spring that gathers most of the trout in summer heat. It is not easy to find, as it is about four feet in diameter and if you are a foot off, you get nothing. You can also throw your dry flies away, because even if they rise, you will not catch them on dries. They fin a lot there and it drives me crazy. I have laid countless dries right in front of them and it never works. The best I can do is fish a small nymph with a dry line. Don’t fish a bead head because that will sink. I lay it in the hole and move it very slowly. They call that fishing the film, and it may work but not often. Most of the time I fish a sinking tip, and let it go down about three feet. When you buy a sinking tip, you have to know what waters you are going to fish. Some are fast sinks and that is no good for this pond. You have to retrieve it so fast to stay off the bottom that it is largely ineffective. When I really was a fisherman, I had five lines on five different reels. My reel of choice is a small medalist. Many have said that a big fish will melt it—well so far it has not happened.
As I approached the spring hole, something did not look right. I always found the spot by going to a bank of weeds and moving about ten feet from the weeds and cast toward the middle of the pond. The bank of weeds was about five feet in width. When I got there this year, the bank of weeds was forty feet wide. I anchored as I always had, but it did not look right. I tried all my favorite flies but got nothing. I heard a rise and saw the ripples from it in the weeds. Then another and another. “Trout in the weeds”? Made no sense. As is said in the market, “don’t fight the fed.” I turned and did my best to cast where the trout were rising. Then they started to jump quite regularly but would not touch anything I presented. Soon I started to connect some dots. The spring was in the weeds or more precisely the weeds had grown into the spring. That is an ominous sign because weeds grow in warm water and it showed me that the spring was not putting out. It would get worse.
When all else fails in fishing, try strip fishing. You use a colorful, large fly and let it sink a bit and strip it in fast. I strip a couple of times and leave it for a second. You are aggravating the fish and they often hit that when they will hit nothing else. It began to work and I caught some trout but I wish I hadn’t. The trout were in terrible shape. Skinny beyond belief. I kept one about fifteen inches that would have weighed a pound and a half under normal circumstances. These were not ordinary circumstances. I tuned to paddle home and I would get the shock that no trout fisherman ever wants to have.
I was in about five feet of water when I saw a dead trout on the bottom. It had just died. It was a large trout and the blood suckers had not touched him. In my experience a trout will be eaten by blood suckers in an hour or less. I thought that perhaps this was a trout that I had caught and released that had died as a result, but the dead trout was about sixteen inches, and I had not released any that size. Then I saw another and another. All large trout recently dead. Then I saw countless dead trout all stacked in various stages of decomposition. Most were just the bones. There were hundreds if not more. Loons? No a loon eats the fish and there are no skeletons. Otters? I have seen trout carnage from marauding otters, and they leave the trout dead but uneaten. But otters can’t catch healthy trout in a pond. They get them when the trout goes up a brook to spawn. Eagles or fish ducks—no way. They don’t leave the carcass. I was looking at the death of my favorite pond
It started years ago when for some reason the brook that fed the pond mysteriously dried up for the first time in forty years. Not lost on me was the fact that there was a major cutting operation going on a mile away, but upstream to the pond. Still, I have no proof of the connection. That fall I snuck into the pond to see if the trout were spawning in the brook. Well, there was no brook but the trout (females) were trying their best tow wiggle through dry gravel, to no avail. I could see several males waiting to fertilize the eggs. Now I think the trout did their best to spawn at the mouth of the brook, mostly in the pond.but that area is unsuitable. The spawn success was greatly reduced, but some spawned and the trout were larger but few and far between. Then came two killer summers, not counting this July which was the hottest July on record. Trout cannot live in warm water and Jewel Pond could not produce enough spring water with her major artery cut. It was grim.
To make matters worse the beaver had lifted the pond, which most of you will say makes for colder water. In the dead of summer all the water heats up and springs that cool it are the only chance. The more water in the pond, the tougher it is for the springs to cool it. I agree that in the spring before the water heats up, high water is cooler but then you get that cross over point. Of course, the beavers don’t know
I talked to the camp owner and told him of my grisly discovery. He said the fishing had been terrible. The Gulf of Maine has risen to unheard of temperatures spreading green crabs that kill mollusks—global warming? The ground fish like cod and haddock are in real trouble, although overfishing may be the cause of that. The glaciers are melting at record pace causing the oceans to rise. If you have a place in Florida, enjoy it because high oceans will take it all.
Jewel gave me the best fishing one could ever ask for. When the limit was eight, I expected and did catch my limit with eight casts. I did not like to catch and release, because it does kill fish, so when I got my limit, I was out of there. And may I say that getting in and out was not easy. I have spent thousands of dollars replacing bearings on vehicles that took that on. Now it could be moody, but not often. If I wanted trout, I went there. It was fished a lot more forty years ago than now but the old timers shot every loon and THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

Full text: The moment I saw Iren’s picture I was hooked and had to look these beetles up. I am always trying to figure out who is feasting on the multitude of deadly amanitas that live all around me in Maine and sure enough the Pleasing Fungus Beetle lives in Maine too, and its larvae feed on amanitas. It’s hard to tell from the picture but I suspect that Iren’s fungus might be an amanita too.
Obviously, whoever named this beetle was an enthusiastic entomologist, that is, a person who studies insects! Pleasing fungus beetles are worldwide in distribution, but the vast majority of the species occur in the tropics. Of the approximately 3,500 known species, only 51 are found in America north of Mexico.
The name ‘fungus beetle’ may be applied to several closely-related groups of beetles. The most commonly encountered ‘fungus beetles’ are the ‘Silken Fungus Beetles’ and the ‘Minute Brown Scavenger Beetles’. As its common name implies, Fungus Beetles feed on a wide variety of fungi not just amanitas.
Fungus beetles also feed on mold or mildews and are attracted to anything that is musty smelling. Moisture levels in new buildings will often attract these insects. Fungus Beetles are harmless, but small enough to get through most screening, vents and other openings. They can be found flying around in homes during late summer.
Some Fungus Beetles are small red/orange and black and these are the ones I am familiar with. Some beetles are splashed with iridescent bright blue or green, although they too have a primarily black shell. Others are simply brown or black. The ones in the picture have a bluish caste to them.
Fungus beetles measure from one tenth to one sixth of an inch in length. Some Fungus beetles have clubbed antennae. Others have bodies covered with dimple – like punctures. Fungus beetles develop from egg larva pupa to adult according to temperature. They can mature in 25 –to 36 days at 75 degrees, but at lower temperatures adults may take 5 months to mature.
Advertisement
A wide variety of the fruiting bodies of fungi serves as hosts for the family as a whole, but each pleasing fungus beetle species seems to be specific to a certain group of fungi. The species with larger individuals, feed in the harder bracket fungi found on dead trees and stumps. Others feed on oyster mushrooms or feed on other mushrooms growing from dead logs and roots. Some members feed on fungi that have mycorrhyzal associations with living tree roots. These mushrooms include Russulas and Amanitas or deathcap mushrooms. Pleasing fungus beetles gravitate to pine and aspen groves.
The sluggish larvae are only found associated with the mature host fruiting body. Adults are often found on the host fungus in large numbers with the larvae. However, adults are also found away from the host. When conditions are unfavorable for the host fungi to fruit, adults often congregate under bark or in other hiding places.
The larvae feed on the fungus during late spring and early summer, consuming large quantities. When full-grown the larvae hang from the underside of the logs and transform to a pupa, often in groups of several dozen. With this habit, a grouping of pupae may appear somewhat like a miniature bat roost. After about a couple of weeks the adults emerge and remain active through the end of summer and into early fall.
Amazingly, Iren’s photograph demonstrates much of the Pleasing Fungus Beetle’s life cycle. Iren told me that she found this log at about 9500 feet in a grove of trees. Thanks Iren!

Full text: LEWISTON — For businesses, the growing shortage of qualified workers in Maine has become a problem that threatens to stifle the economy in the state with the oldest median age.
But for young people with vision, it offers an amazing opportunity, educators and company executives told students Tuesday at the Lewiston Regional Technical Center.
“The world is your oyster here in Maine,” said Deanne Sherman, chief executive officer of Dead River Co. and chairwoman of Educate Maine’s board of directors.
<img class="wp-image-10383223 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/48827193823_0b0a963986_o-300x292.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="292" />
A number of business and education leaders who gathered to speak with students enrolled in the Bridge Academy Maine program called for investing in programs that will help high school students transition directly into college or technical programs that will prepare them for jobs.
Emma Williams, who is in her first year at the University of Maine at Farmington, said that signing up for the Bridge Academy program at Lewiston High School prepared her for college and let her rack up 26 credits before she arrived for her freshman year.
“It saved me a lot of time and money,” the aspiring teacher said.
Brian Langley, executive director of the Bridge Academy program, called Emma Williams “a concrete example” of the good it can do.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-10383215" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/48827726602_4eaa4793b6_o-300x282.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="282" />
Her mother, Jen Williams, said the program provided a huge advantage for her daughter because it offered college credit and because she learned skills, such as time management and how to study properly.
It also provided her the confidence to plunge ahead, the mother said.
Jen Williams said her son, David, a junior at Lewiston, got interested in the program, too, because he saw what it had done for his sister. He plans to become an electrician after graduation.
It is “a really good fit” for her children, Williams said, and highly recommended as a way of having youngsters stay local and develop the skills to earn a living.
Sherman said the bottom line is that by 2025, if current trends hold, Maine will find itself short of 158,000 workers who have the skills or credentials to fill expected jobs in the state.
In short, she said, as the population grows ever older, “more job opportunities will be created than there are workers to fill them.”
In six years, Sherman said, the state needs to ensure that 60% of its working adults have the necessary post-high school credentials. Only 46% of them possess those skills now, a bit less than the national average, she said.
“Maine is experiencing a serious skills gap,” Langley said.
Jason Judd, executive director of Educate Maine, said the looming dearth of qualified workers “could be devastating to Maine.”
<img class="size-large wp-image-10383235" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/48827194543_8463178bcb_o-1024x658.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="658" />
He said “forceful action” to bolster the number of people with the credentials they need is the only answer to keeping the state’s economy humming.
To hasten the required transformation, Sherman said, Maine needs programs like the Bridge Academy Maine and The Green Ladle program in Lewiston, which teaches students everything about running a restaurant.
“It is an urgent issue,” she said, insisting Maine needs “to build a talent pool to meet our business needs.”
In a report issued Tuesday, Educate Maine said by 2025, the school and young working adult population “is projected to decline as the retiree population drastically increases.”
“The ratio of senior citizens to working adults in Maine will increase 93% by 2030,” much higher than the anticipated rise nationally, the report said.
Maine’s median age is 44.6 years, the oldest in the nation, according to businessinsider.com.
The rapid aging, which is nearly inevitable unless Maine attracts far more immigrants than expected from other states and countries, will lead to more jobs “being created than workers to fill them.”
Langley said Bridge Academy is a collaboration among teachers, business and academia that allows a “whole team of adults” to focus on the students participating in the program. It helps them get both the education and skills to shine on the job, he said.
Its students, he said, are prepared “for these really great-paying jobs” of the future.
Judd said workforce development programs that boost students are crucial for economic progress in Maine.
“That is the challenge of our generation,” he said.

Maine guides: Mentors of the outdoors

Full text: <img class="size-full wp-image-10110707" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/maineguide.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" />
REGION — Registered Maine Guides. They are, according to Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, outdoor professionals licensed and permitted to accept payment for accompanying or assisting people in the fields, forests or on the waters or ice while hunting, fishing, trapping, boating, snowmobiling, using an all-terrain vehicle or camping at a primitive camping area.
These men and women can be certified to guide in only one or two specialized activities or they can cover it all.
Licensing for Maine Guides first began in 1897. Cornelia ‘Fly Rod’ Crosby helped develop the program and, because of her efforts, was issued the first guide license. Crosby, a native of Phillips, was a newspaper columnist, marketer of the Maine woods – specifically the Rangeley region. She was also a tenacious advocate for women in male-dominated outdoor activities such as fishing and hunting.
That first year, 1,700 individuals became licensed, primarily in the hunting and fishing disciplines. For many years, testing was not required to become a guide. One simply had to pass muster with the local game warden.
These days, a rigorous testing process must be completed to become a guide. Currently, there are about 6,300 licensed guides in Maine.
We talked to four.
Roger Lambert, Strong
“Fly Rod’s story is part of Maine,” said Roger Lambert of Strong. “It couldn’t be a better story for this state, or for women. It really is part of who we are.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-9281231" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/NORguidesrogerlambert2-223x300.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="300" />
Lambert is a lifetime woodsman with a strong outdoor heritage. “In hunting groups, you always have a lead hunter,” he said. “My father was a lead hunter and, when he got some age on him, I took over.”
His path to becoming a licensed guide started in 1962 when he was 15 years old. He and a friend outfitted and guided a group of Boston University Geology students on a three-day trip up Day Mountain in Strong.
Although he has guided folks for more than 55 years, he has only been a professional guide for about 25 years.
“We got somebody lost and didn’t know the protocol to get them out,” Lambert said. “Becoming a registered guide was just a natural extension of being an outdoorsman.”
Lambert said he was never in it for the money. “It’s a tough way to make a living,” he said. “Most of us do it for the love of the game.”
Lambert has many stories to tell, but its a guided moose hunt with a 13-year old boy that sticks out most. “He got a trophy bull moose in Zone 7,” he added. “We were at a high altitude and in a cloud. It was almost surreal. I will remember that day as long as I live. It wasn’t a Rocky Mountain high, it was a Western Maine Mountain high.”
The boy, Adam Tibbetts, of Berwick, is now a registered guide. “I like to think I was part of showing that young man what it was all about,” he said.
As Lambert winds down his career, he does less guiding and more mentoring.
“I am long in the tooth, what teeth I have left,” he said. “My role now is matchmaking. I connect sports with guides. I educate and I mentor the next generation. There are a lot of good young bucks out there, I am just here to be their cheerleader.”
Abraham Bradeen, Peru
“It has always been a lifelong dream of mine to be a guide and it is because of mentors like Roger that I decided to get my guide license last year,” said Abraham Bradeen of Peru.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-8988819" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/NORguidesbradeen-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />
Like Lambert, Bradeen grew up in the outdoors. He has passed along his knowledge to hunters for over 10 years but not as a registered guide.
Rather than use his status as a guide to earn a living, Bradeen donates his time to Operation ReBoot OutDoors. The non-profit, located in Turner, offers hunting, fishing and recreational adventures to veterans and law enforcement officers at no cost, he said.
“I just started with them in January and have already guided 18 spring turkey hunts and have 24 bear hunts scheduled for the fall,” he said.
His favorite memory involved a fishing trip with a veteran. “His hook was striped and he was out of worms. I had plenty and offered him some. He was so appreciative that someone would do that for him He said the gesture meant the world to him. Later that night, around the campfire, he broke down.
He said he had been trapped in his own house for a long time because he couldn’t be with people. I realized people deal with things in different ways. For veterans, it’s not always about physical injuries. The experience altered my perspective of things and showed me it is the little things in life that really matter.”
Some of the people he guides have experience hunting or fishing. For some, their time with Bradeen is an introduction to the outdoors.
“It really isn’t about hunting or fishing, for me,” he added. “This is about forming friendships and helping people out.”
Jay Wininger, Bridgton
“My whole adult life, from the time I was 22 until I got my guide license at 40, I had been taking people fishing for the fun of it,” said Jay Wininger of Bridgton. “I was the guy with the boat. I cleaned the fish. I ran the whole show. And, I did it for free.”
Fishing has always been a way of life – and work – for Wininger. Originally from Connecticut, he grew up in a fishing family. As an adult, he was an oysterman and lobsterman.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-9331883" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/NORguildesjay1-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="300" />
About the time his children were grown and out on their own, a friend suggested Wininger become a guide so he could get paid for his expertise.
“I thought I would do that in New York on Lake Ontario,” he said. “I fished there a lot. I knew the fish there and I knew the water. But, when my oldest daughter married a guy from here, we started coming here. Eventually, this is where we ended up.
“The fish aren’t any different here than they are in New York. What works on big water works the same here, you just have to downsize.”
This is his 16th season as a Maine fishing guide. He covers all types of freshwater fishing: ice fishing, fly fishing and trolling. He owns and operates Bear Pond Guide Service and is a fishing counselor at Camp Wigwam in Waterford.
“The seven weeks the boys are here, I get to fish every day,” he said. “It’s great to be able to fish with kids.”
In fact, his most memorable moment involves fishing with campers.
“I was on Bear Pond with a couple of kids when two of them hooked on something. I told them their lines were crossed, there was no way both of them had a fish on the line at the same time,” he said.
But, he was wrong. As he was netting a fish for one boy, the other was reeling in his line.
“They each caught a 25-inch salmon,” he said. “Twin fish. Two at once. That doesn’t happen. When we gathered around the flagpole that evening, those boys proudly held up their fish. I’ve had a lot of great things happen on the water, but sharing that moment with the kids is the thing I will always remember.”
Heather Targett, Rangeley
Hunting – and guiding – are family traditions for Maine Master Guide Heather Targett of Rangeley.
“My dad had me out hunting when I was 10,” she said. “My brother, Skip Blood, is a guide who specializes in moose hunting, as well.”
She became a guide in 1996 because of her love for the outdoors, she said.
Targett and her husband, Randy, also a Maine Master Guide, operate On Targett Adventures, specializing in moose hunts. They also manage Cupsuptic Campground in Oquossoc.
“He is an excellent caller,” she said. “We each might take on separate tasks but we definitely guide in tandem.”
As for favorite memories, Heather said every year is special. “We always wonder what the story will be each year. It’s always different and it is always special.”
Heather is aware of the legacy “Fly Rod” started in the region she and her husband live, work and play in. In fact, they have named their bird dogs after her.
“Our first German Shorthaired Pointer was named Crosby,” she said. “Do you know Fly Rod’s middle name? It’s Thurza. That is the name of our second pointer. I think it’s fitting they carry her name.”

Rash of burglaries hits Portland restaurants, stores

Full text: A spate of burglaries has hit downtown Portland businesses – including restaurants – in recent weeks, with thieves entering in the dead of night to rifle cash registers and, in at least one case, walk off with a safe.
Portland police confirmed at least six break-ins since July 28, and said the incidents shared similarities – method of entry, what was stolen – though they’re not yet sure that means they’re connected.
“It’s a terrible feeling to get a call at 6:45 (in the morning) and learn you’ve been broken into,” said Bryna Gootkind of LB Kitchen on Congress Street. “It’s a hard business already, and to learn you’ve been broken into and lost money is terrible.”
Gootkind, who co-owns two locations in Portland with chef Lee Farrington, said her breakfast-lunch restaurant in the East End was hit early Saturday morning.
There was no sign of a forced entry, and the register and safe were gone. That meant a loss of between $700 and $1,000, she said, or roughly half of a day’s gross take.
“It is hard to say why it’s occurring,” Lt. Robert Martin of the Portland Police Department said, dismissing the idea that full registers in a busy tourist season could be an explanation. “We can see something like this any time of the year.”
Martin said he didn’t know whether the incidents were linked. Though several bore similarities – restaurants broken into, their registers emptied – some were different, he said.
A list of burglaries Martin provided included several restaurants, a clothing store, and an optometrist: Maine Oyster Co., 38 Portland St.; Maine Juice Co. at 129 Spring St.; Wallace James Clothing at 112 High St.; Boda restaurant at 671 Congress St.; Little Tap House at 106 High St.; Leavitt & Parris at 200 Kennebec St.; and Eyes on Rosemont at 152 Middle St.
In some cases, there was property damage, and at Eyes on Rosemont nothing at all was taken.
Gootkind said the burglar entered her restaurant through an unlocked door. It’s unclear, she said, whether the door had been left open or the culprit got lucky guessing the keypad combination. Police recovered the restaurant’s register and safe together, but they asked Gootkind not to divulge where. Gootkind said the key to the safe had been stored in the register; when police recovered the safe, the key was locked inside and all the money was gone.
Tablets and laptops sitting around the restaurant were left undisturbed, a detail that puzzles Gootkind. She also wonders why the burglar didn’t just take the money from the safe in the restaurant, instead of carrying out both the safe and register.
“What else is odd is they left a roll of dimes in the register,” she said. “They took all the money except a roll of dimes.”
John Herrigel, owner of Maine Oyster Co., said the burglary at his restaurant took place sometime overnight between Saturday night, Aug. 3, and Sunday morning, Aug. 4. People who live in the building reported the break-in to police on Sunday morning, he said. The burglar had to climb into the backyard to reach the window that was the point of entry. About $500 to $700 was stolen, which was two to three times the amount of money usually left in the register overnight, Herrigel said. “It hurt a little more,” he said.
Like Gootkind, Herrigel was puzzled that the burglar ignored tablets, alcohol and other valuables lying around the restaurant.
Herrigel, who said he feels he’s been “so trusting” about security until now, is taking steps to beef up security at his oyster bar. He’s installed more secure locks and is improving the backyard fencing. He’s also spoken with his staff about not leaving a lot of money in the register overnight.
Tim Nickerson, who owns Maine Juice Co., says his security camera caught a view of the man who burgled his Spring Street store on Aug. 5. The intruder jimmied open the back window, wrenched open the register with a crowbar, and then stole about $600.
The security footage begins with the noise of the break-in, followed about 90 seconds later by the first image of the burglar – a tall, thin white man with shoulder-length dark hair, wearing a light-colored shirt. He immediately began trying to pry open the register. As he worked, the occasional car or pedestrian passed by the front of the restaurant, oblivious to what was going on inside.
The burglar worked on the register for about six minutes. Then, curiously, he opened the fridge, took out a tub of almonds soaking in water and poured it over the register, Nickerson said. The nuts were for a batch of almond milk, but Nickerson doesn’t think the man was thirsty – more likely, it was to cover up any fingerprints.
“It’s pretty miserable being a local business owner and having this happen to you,” Nickerson said in an interview Saturday.
Now, Nickerson feels the need to invest in a full security system. “And that means more monthly fees,” he said.
Portland police said they are actively pursuing investigative leads. They have not made any arrests.

Full text: My friend Iren from Abiquiu just wrote me that on the full moon some fireflies were lighting up the night down by the river’s edge. I was so happy to hear that news because last summer the diminutive lanterns were absent around the casita even though it is situated close to the river. In my Maine backyard this summer some green and gold lights continue to flash their signals just before dark and into the night. I find myself looking for patterns, and counting firefly numbers obsessively, almost against my will, remembering what was…
When I first moved to the mountains 30 plus years ago I camped in the field next to the brook and couldn’t fall sleep at night, struck by “lightning bug” wonder. It seemed as if the field itself was on fire with thousands of these magical lights that blinked as they skimmed the tall grasses, glowing like emerald jewels from the ground. When my camp was built it was awash in firefly light, and each year I anxiously awaited magical, mystical summer nights when my nocturnal friends would appear.
The first evening or so after they arrived, I couldn’t resist capturing a few to keep in a ventilated jar overnight, just as I had done as a child. When it started I thought it was my imagination. Maybe it was a bad year for fireflies I rationalized, the first summer I noted the absence of an abundance of lights hovering over the field. But I was wrong. Year after year, journal entries confirmed my worst fears. The fireflies were disappearing and there was nothing I could do about it. Even now that I know that our insects are experiencing a holocaust there is a child in me that cannot accept that fireflies are leaving us and that its just a matter of time before these insects disappear for good. I recently read that tourists flock to places where (synchronized) fireflies are still abundant.
The grief I feel is visceral.
Fireflies are winged beetles. When a chemical called luciferin inside their abdomen/tail combines with oxygen, calcium and adenosine triphosphate, a chemical reaction occurs that results in bioluminescence. This ‘cool’ light is the most efficient in the world because almost 100 percent of the energy used is emitted as light and not heat. A similar group of organisms are glowworms. The term “glowworm” can refer to firefly larva or wingless adult female fireflies—some of which are not in the firefly family Lampyridae. Both glowworms and fireflies are bioluminescent.
Each species uses it own pattern of lightning flashes to attract a mate, and most fascinating is that some fireflies synchronize their yellow, pale red, green, or orange lights. Several studies have shown that female fireflies choose mates depending upon specific male flash pattern characteristics. Higher male flash rates, as well as increased flash intensity, have been shown to be more attractive to females in two different firefly species. Many would be predators are repelled by firefly blood that contains defensive steroids which apparently taste awful!
Some firefly larvae can emit light from underground, and in some species the eggs glow. The underground-dwelling larvae of the lightning bug are carnivorous and feast on slimy slugs, worms and snails. Others live in the water, have gills and eat aquatic snails before coming ashore. Most adult fireflies feast on pollen and nectar.
Three main factors for firefly disappearance are habitat loss (when fields are paved over fireflies don’t migrate; they simply disappear – this fact may suggest that these insects may be tied to a particular place), logging, toxic chemicals like DEET (which tend to linger in aquatic environments where many fireflies start their lives), and light pollution. Most species of fireflies thrive as larvae in rotting wood and forest litter at the margins of ponds and streams. And as they grow, they more or less stay where they were born. Some species are more aquatic than others, and a few are found in more arid areas – but most are found in fields, forests and marshes. Their environment of choice is warm, humid and near standing water of some kind – ponds, streams and rivers, or even shallow depressions that retain water longer than the surrounding ground. As previously mentioned, both male and female fireflies use their flashing lights to communicate. All species speak a language of light.
Human induced artificial light pollution (including those cute little solar lights) may interrupt firefly flash patterns. Scientists have observed that synchronous fireflies get out of sync for a few minutes after a car’s headlights pass. Light from homes, cars, stores, and streetlights may make it difficult for fireflies to signal each other during mating – meaning fewer firefly larvae are born next season. Where fireflies once had uninterrupted forests and fields to live and mate, homes with landscaped lawns and lots of exterior lights are now the norm.

NORWAY — More than a thousand people are expected to attend the third annual Foothills Food Festival this Saturday in downtown Norway’s Longley Square from 12 Noon–6 PM, rain or shine. The Festival is organized by Community Food Matters, a local community food council which works to promote and support a vibrant local food economy in the Western Foothills of Maine. The Foothills Food Festival celebrates local farmers, food vendors and brewers, and their contribution to local community health and economic development, while addressing the challenges associated with the global food system. This year’s Festival will feature a regional farmers’ market, food tasting at Fare Share Co-op, a variety of food vendors, beer tasting with local brewers, education tables, hands-on workshops and presentations, creative activities for the whole family, and lots of live music.
Farmers from throughout the region will be offering fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, eggs, cheeses, canned goods, maple syrup, perennial food plants, and fiber. This year’s market, again located on Deering Street, features Pietree Orchard and Sy’s Trees from Sweden, Beech Hill Farm & Bison Ranch, Thunderhill Farm and Wandering Root Farm from Waterford, Shady Grove Mushrooms, Jumper Hill Farm, High View Farm and Old School Creamery in Harrison, Bragg Maple Products, A Wrinkle In Thyme Farm and Mighty Maine Greens from Sumner, the Maine Soap Company and Stearns Hill Farm in West Paris, Back to Roots Farm in Woodstock. Also at the market, Regina’s Spices from Portland. A “Grocery Check” will be provided again so Festival goers can shop early and keep their goods cold while they enjoy the rest of the Festival.
Many of the area’s favorite food vendors will be back this year providing delicious fare featuring local ingredients and transforming Deering Street into a bustling “food court” for the day. Fiddlestick Farm from Hanover will be serving up homemade ravioli and flatbreads. Pinky D’s Poutine Truck is back with his world famous poutine. Worth the Wait BBQ returns with their new trailer featuring smoked meats, beans and cornbread, while Riverside Lodge in Paris returns with their fresh artisan pizza. Inside Scoop will be serving up their delicious, locally made ice cream and will be complemented by Maine Morning Roasters from Denmark with locally roasted, fair trade coffee.
New vendors this year will include the Isuken Cooperative from Lewiston with Somali Bantu sambusas and iced chai tea. Street Eats will be serving eclectic street dishes inspired by cuisines from all over the world. Finally, Gone Loco! Cafe in Rumford will be dishing Mexican food and grilled pizza. Offering samplings of goodies in front of the Fare Share Co-op will be Nezinscot Farm in Turner, Pure Botanicals, Happy Hive Farm, and Aqua ViTea (VT) (Bluebernie kombucha blueberries are sourced in Maine).

Festival partner, Alan Day Community Garden will be hosting several workshops as well. Scott Vlaun of C.E.B.E. will kick things off with a talk about raising chickens and give a your of the Garden’s Food Forest. Jesse Stevens of Sy’s Trees in Sweden will discuss “Food Plants You Never Thought of Growing”. Kate McCarthy of Cooperative Extension in Cumberland County will provide a workshop on food preservation.

The Family Activities tent will have multiple kid-friendly activities going on throughout the Festival. Scattered about the Festival grounds will be Fascinating Food Facts to explore and broaden their understanding of the food system.
Food waste is one of the critical issues of our time, both the waste of materials all along the food chain and the waste from consuming food. Festival food vendors will be provided with compostable dishes and utensils that will be collected at Zero-Waste Stations, along with any food waste that will be processed in the Alan Day Community Garden composting demonstration.
The Beer Garden will feature the host, Norway Brewing Company, Oxbow Brewing, Bear Bones Beer, Sebago Brewing Company, Side By Each Brewing, Steam Mill Brewing, Urban Farm Fermentory/Gruit, Barreled Souls Brewing Company, and Saco River Brewing. $25 will get you a wrist band to access the Beer Garden throughout the Festival.

Again this year the Farm to Festival 5k run and relay at Roberts Farm Preserve will take place before the Festival. This event is sponsored by the Western Foothills Land Trust and will begin at 9 a.m. What better way to build an appetite for a food festival?
The Foothills Food Festival is supported by many sponsors and volunteers this year, including major funding by Paris AutoBarn, Pietree Orchard, and Norway Savings Bank, who “is proud to support the Foothills Food Festival,” said Patricia Weigel, President and CEO of Norway Savings Bank. “We believe healthy, local, sustainable food sourcing is a key component to a vibrant community.
The Festival provides a fun way for local residents and visitors to get educated on these important concepts.” Other sponsors include Norway Brewing Company, Oxbow Brewing Company and WJ Wheeler Insurance in South Paris. Also sponsoring are Cafe Nomad, Beech Hill Farm and Bison Ranch, Main Farmland Trust and the Cooperative Development Institute.

So do things happen for a reason? It does seem as if everything happens when you least expected it. Good and bad, only the truly meaningful unexpected things happens. When you think you were absolutely sure that you would be ready for it, and then, out of the clear blue sky, it happens, hence the surprise at the occurrence is what actually surprises you!
NOOOO, WAAAY! Did not expect that! OHHHH Sh…!. I know you’ve been there.
You realize and want people to understand that nobody is perfect and things happen in life beyond our control. We live in a kind of crazy, accidental universe where things happen according to certain laws of life, laws of attraction, laws of nature, the power of manifestation, responsibility, laws of Karma. You get what you give!…..For example, feeding a stray cat once, you might as well sign adoption papers! Hair removal cream packaged to look like shampoo. (Is your hair thinning? Just asking.) Kids and your phone! When Fed Ex drops a trailer load of goods ordered with the mighty power of the “One-Click”. Last Halloween, when you put that washable face paint on for trick or treating with the kids and you end up going to work for days with an orange face, (Not so washable!) Opening your pizza box and all the cheese is stuck to the top! Walking back into the room because you forgot what you went for! Filling up the car with $2.25 gas and when you go to pay, it’s $3.25 a gallon. Shoveling the snow and finding a crumbled $10 bill. (Good Karma?) When your friends and family show their true faces. (No comment!) Sneaking out of the house after curfew, and from below a flashlight gleaming at you being held by Dad. Lighting that one firework, and accidentally setting the whole box off. (Run, run, run). Getting $20 out of the ATM and $40 comes out.
One thing for sure-no matter how organized we are or how well we plan-you can always expect the unexpected. Most of life is unexpected, old age is unexpected. Getting a present on your birthday is not as much fun as getting a present on any other day, you respond to pleasant things more when things are unexpected. Everything happens for a reason. Right? I wonder what reason is good enough to explain why “Accidents” or “Did not see that coming” or “Really?” kind of stuff happen to some people.
Life is very unpredictable and death being the extreme end of it, is the most unexpected itself and bitter truth of life. I have no claim to know the secrets to God or the universe but am convinced no true lasting happiness can come of this world where life is fleeting, illusionary and death are the only constants. The most intriguing part of the question for me is not the unexpected thing that happens, it’s the shock that leaves us open for exploration. The unexpected allows us to see ourselves differently-because of how we deal with or how we see this, “the real shock”. The most unexpected reality of life is the speed at which decades flash by, surreal dreams and times, people coming and going, passing through in proportion to things of importance of life. How do I have memory of things from 50+ years ago and it seems like yesterday?
The truly significant realness, the once in a million thing that you never expect, the unforeseen thing, both good and what seems unspeakable, happens when we are unprepared for them and just happens. Bad things happen to good people on a regular basis, expectations lead to disappointment and when the unexpected happens, the surprise of the unknown is all joy, amazement and happiness because of the fact it astonished you and life’s fairly excruciating-painful things happen-once and you dragged yourself out, gasping for air recognizing the “OH Wow” moment you didn’t expect. We may think we know what we like, but what our brain really wants is often quite different. Guilty pleasures make up a world of complexities, surprising visual aspect, and beautiful mistakes like the smell of peppermint, frying bacon, freshly mowed grass, brewing coffee, the sound of Big Band music, cats purring, the smell of fresh rain. We all have guilty pleasures, Mama’s includes dark chocolate, oysters on the half shell, a bottle of Toscana, freshly baked croissants.
Getting caught up in daily stresses is hard to avoid which is why people watching, peering into the lives of others is a favorite pleasure of many, like a temporary escape from your worries. Others put peace and quiet at the top of their list and indulge in a warm bubble bath and zone out for a while. Simply avoiding a particular undesirable activity puts procrastination at the top of most people’s list.
Nobody sticks to boring when it comes to food. New unexpected food have taken taste buds on an adventure and become game changing. Food that when you tasted it, you were completely blown away, and you needed to have one more bite, or a way to get more, a craving of some sort…Have you tried chocolate covered popcorn? The salty-sweet combination of melted ultra processed chocolate poured over popcorn. One would say there is nothing better in the world. Fresh apple pie with a slice of sharp cheddar cheese? On the healthy side, my sister swears up and down that spaghetti squash is the bomb. Slice a squash in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds, lightly drizzle the inside with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place the squash cut side down on a baking sheet, use a fork to poke holes in it, roast for 30 to 40 minutes in a preheated 400~ oven. Remove from the oven, flip your squash over, let cool to touch. Use a fork to scrape and fluff the strands from the sides. Serve with butter. You can also dress it up with a squeeze of lemon and a dollop of pesto. A guilty pleasure on it’s own.
Cauliflower, a calciferous vegetable has been turned into rice and pizza crust as well. So “rice” is made by pulsing the cauliflower in the food processor until it forms into granules the size of rice and sauteed lightly with olive oil, the juice of a half of lime (to remove the bitterness), salt and pepper for 3-5 minutes. Coconut, turmeric, sesame, cilantro, lemon and Parmesan are the best spices that work well with cauliflower. On it’s own, can’t say it is as good as rice, but it’s a great starting point health-wise. When well-seasoned and used with other great flavors and textures, it will make you feel good about getting more vegetables in your diet. Unexpectedly delicious foods make us feel happy. Taking a bite of something expecting one taste and experiencing another can be enjoyable or a disgusting happening. Try it…it could become your guilty pleasure food.
As always, you can drop me a line at: scrappychef@yahoo.com. And the last words….~Vegetables are a must on a diet. I suggest carrot cake, zucchini bread and pumpkin pie.~ Jim Davis

The Yarmouth Clam Festival boasts a lot of old-time favorites – a Friday night parade, Saturday night fireworks, carnival rides and games, juried craft and art shows, two stages of musical entertainment, a firefighters’ muster, a clam shucking contest and, at the center of all the festivities, more than a dozen food booths fundraising for at least 35 local nonprofits.

Where else can you eat fried clams, onion rings and strawberry shortcake, wash that down with a lime Rickey and feel like you’ve kept a community thriving?
New additions to the festival include a sand-sculpture contest at Brickyard Hollow Brewing attracting eight semi-professional sculptors from around the country, a timed pie-eating contest inspired by the First Parish Church’s famous homemade pie booth, and a Sunday afternoon classic car show called the Main Street Rumble.
Steamer the clam mascot has some competition as festival favorite, thanks to Barry Williams, the star of “The Brady Bunch” as the oldest son Greg Brady. Williams will usher in this year’s board game-themed parade Friday, July 19, at 6 p.m. and will be at the clam shucking-contest the next day at 11 a.m.
Speaking of board games, Yarmouth History Center is hosting an oversized, playable Monopoly board featuring historic photos and facts about the community that has been hosting this family-oriented summer festival since 1965.

The Yarmouth Clam Festival started as the Firemen’s Field Day, and the firefighters’ muster is a well-preserved tradition attracting firefighters and spectators from all over Maine and New England. On a hot summer day, nothing beats a little mist from the firehose – other than perhaps a lime Rickey, lemon Lucy or root beer float.
Another longtime festival favorite, the Sunday morning Diaper Derby, has been happening for so long that many participants are second- or even third-generation.
“It’s as cute as it sounds,” said Adrienne Nardi, executive director of the Yarmouth Chamber of Commerce and co-director of the Yarmouth Clam Festival. “We’ve got babies who are crawling, barely walking and moving at a good run, and their parents cheering them on.”
Nardi’s first year with the festival was in 2017, when she loaded buckets for the clam-shucking contest, drove princesses around town in a golf cart after their parade gig and stepped into the Steamer costume when she was short a volunteer.
“On Friday night, after the parade, I was coming down Main Street and walking into the Food Circle at Memorial Green when I had a movie magic moment,” she said. “The sun was setting and the fun streetlights we bring in were lit on the green. There was music playing in the entertainment tent, and I half expected to see Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick Jr. dancing like I was on the set of a romantic comedy. Very Rockwell-esque. I knew I found the right job.”
The festival spreads out over downtown Yarmouth, surrounding the intersection of Route 1 and Main Street and along the Royal River. Paid parking near the festival benefits local nonprofits. Or, if you want save your clams for the steamers, park at Garmin off Exit 17 and take a shuttle bus to the festival (except during the Friday evening rush hour, from 5-7 p.m., when the shuttle stops running).

Full text: Sunday River Resort may be best known for its winter persona: Excellent skiing for every skill level across eight interconnected mountain peaks and world-class events—not to mention its storied snowmaking. But Sunday River is a four-season destination. From scenic Chondola lift rides to disc golf and twin zip lines, Sunday River offers plenty of awesome activities during the summer (and fall), too.
The L.L.Bean Outdoor Discovery Schools offer engaging programs out of Sunday River’s Grand Summit Hotel, including archery, kayaking, and stand-up paddleboarding. Ranging from 80 minutes to three hours, these midweek beginner courses and tours are guided by expert instructors, include all the necessary equipment, and provide new ways to explore the greater Sunday River area.
For those guests who prefer ease, guests to Sunday River can purchase an Adventure Pass which includes unlimited access to some of the resort’s most popular activities, including scenic Chondola lift rides, a bungee trampoline, the 750-foot Twin Zips, the rock climbing wall, and an 18-hole alpine disc golf course. The resort is also home to an extensive network of hiking trails. Whether you opt to reach new heights or work on your Frisbee handicap, Sunday River’s roster of summer activities will definitely keep the whole family entertained. Tickets, Adventure Passes, and rentals are available at the South Ridge Lodge.
And while these warm-weather activities are offered all season long, there are also special events that make Sunday River a great destination for summer vacations. Returning to the slopes is the River Rock Festival (July 5 and 6)—a Christian music celebration with performances in the afternoon and evening by artists like Danny Gokey, We Are Messengers, Iron Bell, and more.
The New England Forest Rally (July 19 and 20) bases out of Sunday River’s South Ridge parking areas before tearing through the Western Maine and Northern New Hampshire dirt and gravel logging roads. One of six National Championship rallies to take place in the United States, many local and regional enthusiasts compete right alongside such top national competitors.
Now in its 10th year, Sunday River’s Tough Mountain Challenge mud race (July 27) is a must for the competition-minded. The 5k race has over 20 obstacles, and includes a grueling hike up the mountain for nearly 4,000 competitors, as well as the Mini Mountain Challenge (July 28) for the kids.
The resort will also welcome back Maine craft breweries for the Maine Brew Fest September Session (Sept. 13-15), with over 100 samples of beer and cider made in Maine, as well as an oyster tasting.
To cap off the summer and fall season, Sunday River hosts the annual Fall Festival on Columbus Day Weekend (Oct. 12-13). Home to such events as the annual North American Wife Carrying Championship (Oct. 12), the New England Cornhole Championship (Oct. 13), and the Blue Mountain Arts and Crafts Fair (October 12-13).
Of course, right around this time, the real sight to behold becomes the fall foliage. Yankee Magazine has ranked the Bethel area as New England’s top foliage venue come fall, and pointed to Sunday River’s Chondola as one of the best ways to take in all of the brilliant colors. During summer and fall, the Chondola whisks guests to the mid-mountain Peak Lodge, where views of the Mahoosuc and Presidential mountain ranges extend for miles. No trip to Maine’s Western Mountain region is complete without ogling the immaculate landscape from the top of the Chondola. Whether you visit with family and friends, or as part of a wedding or conference, you’ll be sure to have a fantastic time at Sunday River in any season.
For more on these events and activities, please visit www.sundayriver.com or call 800-543-2754.

Full text: For many, it’s not a Maine summer without lobster; for some vacationers, the state crustacean is a must-have at every meal. If you’re still not quite buying the beastlike things as a culinary delicacy – back in the 1800s, lobster was considered fit only to feed state prisoners with or use as fertilizer – know that once you’ve cracked into one and developed a taste for it, it can be hard to go back to wanting anything else when within state lines.
Sure, it’s much more expensive than it was before it was considered a luxury shellfish, but it doesn’t have to be eaten in huge amounts or set you back the cost of a mortgage payment to be a memorable gastronomic experience. Here are three local lobster menu specialties that are just that for every budget.
CHEAP: BITE INTO MAINE
What’s cheaper than a lobster roll, but equally addictive? A $13.95 lobster grilled cheese. At two of its three locations, Bite Into Maine has taken up the cause of slinging this delicious invention with aplomb. Witness the melding of fresh Maine lobster with gooey, creamy fontina and sharp white cheddar cheeses, grilled between two chipotle aioli- and butter-slathered slices of sourdough bread. (There’s also a B.L.T. version—lobster with mayo, local tomato, local thick-cut bacon and iceberg lettuce on butter-grilled ciabatta.) You’ll find it at the eatery’s Airstream, stationed at Allagash Brewing from April to December, and at The Commissary, its brick-and-mortar, 12-seat takeout joint in Scarborough.
WHAT: Bite Into Maine
WHERE: Allagash Brewing Co., 50 Industrial Way, Portland; The Commissary, 185 Route 1, Scarborough
HOURS: At Allagash, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. In Scarborough, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday.
INFO: (207) 289-6142, biteintomaine.com, @biteintomaine on Facebook and Instagram
MID-PRICED: PORTLAND LOBSTER COMPANY
Slide into a seat on the sunny deck overlooking the working waterfront and crack into a traditional lobster dinner served on a simple paper tray. Market-priced (i.e., determined by weather, the success of the day’s catch, and supply and demand) but moderately so, Portland Lobster Company’s lobsters – from chicken-sized on up to 2-pounders — are delivered live twice a day. They’re plated up with fries or baked potato, corn on the cob, homemade slaw, and drawn butter. Savor it all while kicking back in the fresh, salty breeze, beneath the cries of gulls overhead, the coos of fellow happy diners all around you and maybe even a live band.
WHAT: Portland Lobster Company
WHERE: 180 Commercial St., Portland
HOURS: 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday
INFO: (207) 775-2112, portlandlobstercompany.com, @PortlandLobsterCompany on Facebook
INDULGENT: FIVE FIFTY-FIVE
Chef Steve Corry’s deft hand with ingredients, both humble and haute, has justifiably made this boîte one of the most lauded in town. And Corry, an alum of Napa’s French Laundry and Domaine Chandon, doesn’t hold back on making Maine ingredients sing. Exhibit A: His truffled Lobster Mac and Cheese — butter-poached lobster folded into black truffles, a blend of artisanal cheeses, white truffle oil and macaroni. It’s so rich and delectable, it’s more like a savory dessert than entree. At $36.50, it’s a splurge worthy of any special occasion.
WHAT: Five Fifty Five
WHERE: 555 Congress St., Portland
HOURS: Daily, 4:30 p.m.-9:30 p.m.

Sure, it’s much more expensive than it was before it was considered a luxury shellfish, but it doesn’t have to be eaten in huge amounts or set you back the cost of a mortgage downpayment to be a memorable gastronomic experience. Here are three local lobster menu specialties that are just that for every budget.
Cheap: Pool Street Market
There’s nothing particularly remarkable about the recipe for the lobster rolls at this perfunctory counter; the roll isn’t artisanal or grilled. The only add-ons you’ll find are the old standbys: lettuce, butter or maybe a swipe of mayo. But when they hand over your order, it’s impossible not to notice how stuffed with lobster it is, and how incredibly fresh that meat is. They include knuckle meat, which any lobster aficionado will happily tell you is the best, most tender part. The prices, meanwhile, are according to size. The smallest, still teeming with a generous scoop of that same flavorful meat, rings in at $6.95 — which may be the most remarkable thing of all.
WHAT: Pool Street Market
WHERE: 77 Pool St., Biddeford
HOURS: 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday, 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday
INFO: (207) 282-9824, @Poolstreetmarket1 on Facebook and @poolstreetmrkt on Twitter
Mid-priced: Mike’s Clam Shack
Its name notwithstanding, Mike’s is less of a shack and more of a no-frills, family-friendly restaurant. But that aside, the real emphasis here is on the super fresh lobster dinners that are market-priced (i.e., determined by weather, the success of the day’s catch, and supply and demand). They’re served with the standard sides, all well executed: veggie, cole slaw, baked potato and the like. As for the prized shellfish itself, they range in size from chicken lobsters on up to 2-pounders. And if you’d rather skip all the dismantling and cut to the chase, go for the Lazy Man’s Lobster and dig into a steamy mound of sweet lobster meat sautéed in butter, minus all the cracking.
WHAT: Mike’s Clam Shack
WHERE: 1150 Post Road, Wells
HOURS: 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wed through Sunday

Few places can match the magical experience of dining at Earth, tucked into Hidden Pond resort’s beautiful, birch-studded woods and surrounded by carefully tended gardens. The dining room, anchored by a gargantuan fireplace, nails that rare balance between special occasion-worthy and chic yet fun and unpretentious. And that balance continues in all of the kitchen’s dishes, and particularly in the $100 entree for two: two pound-and-a-half local lobsters, smoky and deep-flavored from a wood-fired cooking, alongside accoutrements like wood-fired corn, potatoes, clam chowder and a drawn butter that turns everything it touches into velvet.

Full text: Lobster doesn’t just have a special place in Maine’s heart; it’s our favorite dish and practically our de facto national symbol. And who can blame us? On a warm, sunny day, it’s almost impossible to beat the crustacean’s sweet, salty, and delicious meat — whether it’s found in a bisque, on a buttered roll, folded into a flaky pie, or released directly from its shell, squirted with fresh lemon, and dunked into hot melted butter.
But that kind of utter deliciousness usually comes at a cost. Lobster is notoriously one of the most expensive orders off any menu. And yet, it doesn’t have to be. The best thing about a meat as flavorful and as decadent as the king of the crustaceans is, you don’t need a lot of it to elevate lots of other (less expensive) ingredients — potatoes, say, or pasta, risotto, tomatoes or cheese — in a given dish. And if you feel like ponying up for the pure, get-your-hands-dirty and crack it from the shell, so be it.
At the end of the day, the thing about lobster is, it’s whatever you make of it, whether that’s humble or fancy. As long as it’s fresh and cooked right, it’s going to be delicious. So here are three local dishes we found that are exactly that, in price brackets ranging from low to high, that make the most of one of Maine’s most rightfully lauded natural resources.
$: Pinky D’s Poutine Factory
Poutine has become its own culinary battleground in recent years. There are those who adore the stick-to-your-ribs Quebecois specialty that’s become trendy of late, and those who hate it for being so sloppy. Then again, there are also those who say they hate it, but secretly love it. And hey, to each their own.
But the truth is that it’s tough to imagine anyone hating the lobster poutine doled out by Pinky D’s, the award-winning food truck from husband and wife Deborah and Randy Smith. The duo has fashioned a $16 dish — a heaping jumble of French fries, sherried bisque, cheese curds, and deftly added the coveted shellfish, salty and singing of the sea.
For lobster lovers, it’s the kind of creation that transcends all food snobbery, worthy of lumberjacks and connoisseurs alike.
WHAT: Pinky D’s Poutine Factory

$$: Chick-a-dee
Lewiston’s beloved, family-owned seafood restaurant is the kind of place people go for a real-deal, straight-up, Maine lobster dinn-ah. So why should you be any different? The fixings are fresh off the boat, and reasonably market-priced (i.e., determined by weather, the success of the day’s catch, and supply and demand).
Choose from a score of classic sides (hand-cut fries, cole slaw, pickled beets and such) and add a pile of steamer clams, if you’re so inclined.
WHAT: Chick-a-dee
WHERE: 1472 Lisbon St., Lewiston
HOURS: Sunday-Thursday, 10:30 a.m.-8 p.m.; Friday-Saturday, 10:30 a.m.-9 p.m.

$$$: Fish Bones Grill
Never mind the eyebrow-raising name; the focus of this graceful, welcoming spot has been on bringing the local community together over food — and serving them something equally cosseting to eat while doing so — since it opened in 2005. Case in point: the kitchen’s truffled lobster garganelle, jacked up with roasted wild mushroom confit, a four-cheese al fredo sauce, and dusted with herbed breadcrumbs.
The dish is set at market price, according to the current cost of the sweet, silken chunks of lobster within. But you came here for the full-on, splurge-driven experience; so who cares what’s left in your wallet tomorrow? This is a dish you’ll be dreaming about years from now.

Full text: We had a great winter, didn’t we?
Well, it was great if you like snow and I love snow. I like to think of the seasons here in Maine as the earth breathing. In the winter the land inhales snow and in the spring exhales the snowmelt into the Gulf. In the summer it dries out, only in the fall to prepare for the next deep breath of winter.
The native tribes in Maine would follow that pattern traveling north on the frozen water to hunt deer, moose and bear, then riding the swollen waterways down the river with their bounty to the village. They would plant their crops and then continue to the gulf to harvest shellfish before they returned to the village for the harvest before being inhaled to the north again to hunt.
All that water continues to be exhaled to the gulf, leaving behind mud. I find mud to be way more frustrating than snow. After the long winter and with the warmer weather, I’m biting at the bit to get out on trails but I know how sloppy they still are. So mud season is planning season, and there are so many plans.
With the Western Foothills Land Trust, we will be putting in a new trail going into the Witt Swamp Extension. We will also be getting a new ski trail started in the new Roberts Farm Extension property. Last year, we started a new trail system at the Hatch Preserve at Hawk Mountain and the Twin Bridges Preserve on the Crooked River. This year we will be adding way finding signage to those trails.
As the land continues to exhale, my mind is wandering where my feet can’t. I’m thinking of a new trail design at the Noyes Mountain Preserve to take people to see other parts of the large preserve. One of our other large preserves is the Virgil Parris Forest. There, too, I’m thinking of a new trail and where it should go, where do I want to take you.
Finally, there’s an exiting new collaborative trail project with the Progress Center, the Town of Norway and the Town of Paris, that will finally turn the Norway Branch Railroad into an ADA accessible walking path, the Norway Branch Rail Trail. This also includes improvements on the Matthew Record Trail. If you are interested in volunteering to help clean out the bed, give me a shout.
There’s so much to think about as the earth breathes. By the next deep breath of winter, there will be new places for us to explore.

Full text: With a travel agent mom who had a taste for adventure, Ken Gerhard found himself vacationing beside Loch Ness at age 15.
He grabbed his 8 mm movie camera and set off for his first field research.
“I carried it around the lake and I interviewed the locals (about monster sightings,)” he said.
Decades later, he’s one of the busiest cryptozoologists on TV, easily recognizable with his turned-up cowboy hat, frequently seen out in the field looking for Bigfoot and other as-yet-unproven beasts.
At the fourth annual International Cryptozoology Conference in Portland this weekend, Gerhard, from San Antonio, Texas, will lay out the case for the existence of Thunderbirds, enormous dark birds with raptor-like beaks.
“I think the vast, vast majority of sightings go undocumented,” he said. “Just like other cryptids, there are probably some people who see them who just don’t want to be ridiculed, ‘I can’t ever tell anybody I saw that thing, they’ll think I’m nuts.’ But moreover, a surprising number of people don’t realize that a bird with a 15- or 20-foot wingspan should not exist.”
He said he’s interviewed dozens of credible-sounding witnesses. Gerhard has authored, “Big Bird! Modern Sightings of Flying Monsters” and “Encounters with Flying Humanoids: Mothman, Manbirds, Gargoyles & Other Winged Beasts.”
He’s open-minded, but needs proof.
“Thinking critically, that is problematic that we don’t have more evidence,” Gerhard said. “No one has described finding a giant nest or feather — actually there is one account of a giant feather, but it’s very old — an eggshell, a giant pile of bird crap on someone’s window, all of these things you would expect to find.”
Gerhard grew up in Minnesota. He remembers being 8 or 9 when Saturday-morning cartoons were interrupted by a news segment on the now-famous Patterson-Gimlin footage.
“I thought it was the most amazing thing,” he said. “The possibility there could be some giant man-like animal running around the woods in the forests of North America is pretty mind-blowing.”
He went to the library and read all he could. Whenever the family traveled to places like the Amazon River, Thailand or North Africa, “I would always study or research the legends of mythological animals in each region,” he said.
Gerhard has had only one experience personally, near a remote North Texas lake in 2005. He recorded deep, loud, primate-sounding grunts after the sun went down and caught eye shine in a spotlight.
The next morning, “where we’d heard this thing, I saw some deep footprints on the sandy beach, human-like footprints, and I saw there were several turtles that had literally been ripped in half from top to bottom,” he said. “All that to me is the convincing thing, ‘Wow it seems like we encountered some sort of unknown animal tonight.'”
Gerhard has appeared on Travel Channel’s “In Search of Monsters,” History Channel’s “Missing in Alaska” and “Monsterquest,” and will be in the documentary “Terror in the Skies” by Seth Breedlove, premiering at the International Cryptozoology Conference.
He’s also a volunteer educator at the San Antonio Zoo, which, he noted proudly, is “the only zoo that has sponsored a Yeti expedition, back in the 1950s.”
“There are a lot of places on our planet that are still vast and unexplored — people lose sight of that in the modern age,” he said. “There are on average about 5,000 new species described every year. Admittedly, most of them are small — invertebrates, mollusks, frogs. But every few years there is a large, surprising animal.”
So, the hunt continues.
Gerhard, who will be coming to Maine for the first time, said his TV-famous cowboy hat comes from his past as a touring musician.
“We’ve been through a lot, that hat and I,” he said. “I’ve worn it 15 degrees below zero in the Alaskan mountains and I’ve worn it in the sweltering jungles of Central America. There’s a sense of adventure, an Indiana Jones-feel sometimes to what we’re doing. You have to keep it fun, as well.”

Janet Mills vows more than just hot air on climate change

Author: Collins, Steve

Abstract: Spurred by visions of a Maine remade amid catastrophic environmental change, Mills has put the state back in the fight to preserve the climate with a series of steps to reduce carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels — and more in the works. Melanie Loyzim, deputy commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, told legislators recently that her department “supports a clear and aggressive target” for greenhouse gas emissions that would reach an 80% reduction by 2050. The coastal group would look at such problems as rising sea levels and how to make sure streets beside the water don’t wind up with ocean waves lapping on the pavement, she said. LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MEET CLIMATE TARGETS Among the measures Mills is eyeing to reduce the state’s carbon footprint are more wind and solar energy production, along with the use of electric-powered vehicles.

Full text: AUGUSTA — For Gov. Janet Mills, climate change isn’t just a matter of political debate.
For her, it’s an issue that cuts instead to the heart of what Maine is all about.
In one recent speech, the 71-year-old Mills wondered if Mainers in the not-too-distant future “may not know the state we call home” if the issue isn’t dealt with.
She wondered whether her grandchildren, when they reach her age, will still hear “the singsong call of a black-capped chickadee or the smell of asters and lilies.”
“Will they know what the bark of a fir tree looks like or the grit of sand between their toes as they walk along the shores of Perkins Cove? With butter on their lips and sun on their faces, will they taste Maine in lobsters caught off Casco Bay?” she asked.
That concern, she said last week in her State House office, is what’s driving her to make climate change one of her top priorities as governor, in striking contrast to her predecessor, Gov. Paul LePage, who expressed little concern about a warming planet during his eight years in office.
Spurred by visions of a Maine remade amid catastrophic environmental change, Mills has put the state back in the fight to preserve the climate with a series of steps to reduce carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels — and more in the works.
With a Democrat-controlled Legislature that is generally favorable to her agenda, Mills said the state must act swiftly and broadly on a range of climate-change initiatives “before it’s too late.”
Researchers warn that the world — not only Maine — is running out of time to make serious changes or face rising temperatures that will transform the environment.
Ivan Fernandez, a longtime science professor at the University of Maine, recently described for state lawmakers what climate change is already doing in the state.
“We have warming temperatures, shorter winters, less snow, a longer growing season, rising sea levels, the fastest warming oceans on the planet, intensifying storms and increasing uncertainty and variability in weather that burdens communities and businesses across Maine,” he said.
In addition, Fernandez warned, “most of these trends are accelerating.”
Mills said the growing threat from climate change is the reason she wants to address it.
“Why care about ticks invading our woods and our public parks?” she asked rhetorically. “Why care about kids with high asthma rates? Why care about lobsters off the coast moving north? Why care about the diminished fisheries in cod and shellfish and herring? Why care about rising sea levels?”
“Because it’s Maine,” she answered, “and we value our clean water and clean air. We value our public health.”
TRYING TO TACKLE A COMPLEX PROBLEM
Susan Inches, a former deputy director of the State Planning Office who is teaching courses at Bates and Colby colleges about the need for environmental advocacy, said the state has “a tremendous opportunity at hand.”
“After eight years of division, there’s a hunger among Maine people to find hope, and put Maine on a course that better serves everyone,” she recently told the Legislature’s Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.
As a first step, the new administration is trying to figure out in the broadest sense what its goals are.
Mills said she is aiming to ensure that Maine gets all of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050, a standard that would require the development of far more solar and wind power. It may also rely on technology that doesn’t yet exist.
But the problem goes far beyond how electricity is generated, particularly since slightly more than half of the greenhouse gas emissions in Maine come from transportation, mostly cars and trucks.
In addition, more than two-thirds of Mainers heat their homes with oil, costing Mainers $5 billion a year and contributing to global warming.
Hannah Pingree, who heads Mills’ Office of Innovation and the Future, said the administration hopes to slash overall carbon emissions in Maine by 45% by 2030.
Melanie Loyzim, deputy commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, told legislators recently that her department “supports a clear and aggressive target” for greenhouse gas emissions that would reach an 80% reduction by 2050.
Those are tough numbers to attain, officials readily acknowledge.
To get there, they say, will require a complex mix of policy initiatives, possibly ranging from floating offshore windmills to feeding Maine-grown seaweed to cows that might reduce the volume of methane the animals naturally produce.
A new Maine Climate Council will coordinate the state’s efforts to address the problem.
Pingree said the council will likely have six groups within its structure to deal with science, transportation, energy and electricity, buildings and infrastructure, working lands, and coastal and marine issues.
The working lands group, for example, would look into a range of issues, including possible measures to sequester carbon — capturing it before it enters the atmosphere — so that it doesn’t add to the rising greenhouse levels, Pingree said.
The coastal group would look at such problems as rising sea levels and how to make sure streets beside the water don’t wind up with ocean waves lapping on the pavement, she said.
Pingree said the council would be more than a one-time task force. The idea is to lock the structure into law and to update its plans regularly as more data and scientific input become available.
Mills said the bottom line is that coping with climate change in Maine requires dealing with three basic areas: electricity, transportation and home heating.
BRINGING IT HOME
For government leaders, issues as difficult as climate change can prove vexing, in part because they frequently require technical or scientific knowledge that few possess.
But sometimes, it’s a lot simpler than that.
For Mills, the advantages of switching from burning oil to using an electric heat pump are as obvious as her winter heating costs.
She said she plans to get a heat pump for her house in Farmington “because I’m tired of paying the oil bill.”
This month, she said, she actually ran out of oil — something many Mainers can sympathize with — and the bill to fill up her tank again “made me so mad.”
“This has got to stop,” Mills said she told herself. It shouldn’t cost her “thousands of dollars every winter in my home where it’s just me” much of the time.
A heat pump is the likeliest alternative, she said, because it will pay for itself pretty quickly.
Mills said many Mainers could benefit from doing the same, but people often can’t afford to buy them because even though they’d save over the long run, they don’t have the cash to make the initial investment.
Many people can’t afford proper heating, as it is.
Campaigning across Maine, Mills said she saw quite a few “scary situations” with gas heaters beside beds and people using ovens for heat.
That’s why, she said, she pushed for a $15 million allocation as part of a deal for her support for a controversial proposed transmission line to bring Hydro Quebec electricity to Massachusetts, via Lewiston.
“My thinking was there’s a lot of middle-class people who buy heat pumps to put in their homes,” Mills said, but that’s not enough.
“I want to see every trailer park, every mobile home park, in Maine have heat pumps,” she said. “I want to see houses in the suburbs and ranch houses on the outskirts of the cities have heat pumps,” because their open construction, often on concrete slabs, make heat pumps the best option.
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MEET CLIMATE TARGETS
Among the measures Mills is eyeing to reduce the state’s carbon footprint are more wind and solar energy production, along with the use of electric-powered vehicles.
Mills said solar “has come down in price” and is increasingly competitive with any alternative.
She said she is especially excited about the possibilities offered for community solar projects, such as putting panels on schools, churches, libraries, community centers and “other places the public gathers.”
The governor said more solar also means more jobs in the solar field, an area in which Maine lags behind Massachusetts and a number of other states.
“For the most part, these jobs attract younger people who are excited about what they do, excited to contribute to the betterment of the community and do something for the environment.” Mills said.
More wind-generated electricity is a virtual certainty, as well.
Mills said she moved quickly to reverse LePage’s moratorium on wind-power projects because there is an existing regulatory system that can review proposals adequately to ensure they will benefit the public.
She said she is also determined to press ahead in particular with the University of Maine’s wind energy project, Aqua Ventus, which would rely on “floating offshore wind platforms.”
“I don’t want to lose out on offshore wind,” Mills said.
U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, touted the project recently, as well, happy that she helped secure federal funds to allow a demonstration of the project off Monhegan Island, about 14 miles off Maine’s coast.
Rick Perry, the U.S. energy secretary, called the Aqua Ventus project a good first step.
He said that empowering states “to go develop these alternative sources of energy, whether it’s advanced nuclear reactors or whether it’s these offshore wind platforms, is very, very wise for us as a country.”
Transportation may be the toughest area for change in Maine, but officials said switching to cars, trucks and buses that rely on electricity would make a big dent in the state’s carbon output.
While less than 1 percent of Maine drivers rely on electric-powered vehicles today, Mills said the number is going to rise.
The state is putting money into programs to construct more charging stations, which Mills said will encourage tourism and help nudge people to give electric cars a shot.
In addition, Mills said, the state is going to help social service agencies buy electric vehicles. It’s doing the same with its own fleet.
Pingree said rebates for people who buy electric vehicles are also a possibility.
With everything in the works, the governor said, “Maine will be one of the top players in the electric vehicles” field, perhaps even the state with the most access to electric vehicles and charging stations.
“This is a way for people to save carbon and dollars,” Mills said.
Mills and Pingree said many possible approaches to climate change exist, and new ideas are emerging frequently.
“It’s very complicated. I don’t pretend to have all the answers,” Mills said.
But, she said, it’s important for the state to stay on top of the issue and to do what it can to limit the potentially dire impact of the changing climate.
It’s a job that will take decades, almost certainly lasting beyond the lifetimes of today’s leaders and perhaps even their children and grandchildren.
“I probably won’t be around then,” Mills said, “but I want to start us out on that road. Because we have to.”

Full text: If Josh Rogers had his way, Maine would be known as much for its use of seaweed in dishes as it is for lobster.
For the past several years, Rogers, who lives in Portland and grew up in Auburn, has been working toward putting Maine on the map as a place that offers a high-quality brand of seafood
Rogers is the owner of Heritage Seaweed, a retail shop at 61 India St. in Portland that specializes in ocean-based goods. He’s also responsible for creating Cup of Sea, a brand of loose-leaf herbal and caffeinated teas featuring Maine seaweed.
Nearly a year after opening his store, Rogers is preparing to launch “Seaweed Week” from April 26 to May 4, during which more than 50 restaurants, bars, breweries and distilleries throughout Maine, including the Pub at Baxter Brewing in Lewiston, will offer menu items that feature seaweed.
Rogers is referring to it as the country’s “first-ever Kelp Food Festival and Harvest Celebration,” because the event coincides with the state’s annual kelp harvest.
While some restaurants in Maine have already been using seaweed in some of their menu items, Rogers said he hopes Seaweed Week will “challenge others to start innovating with them.”
Rogers said his great-grandparents moved from New Brunswick in Canada to the Lewiston-Auburn area to work in the shoe shops “and brought this tradition of eating dulse.”
Dulse is a red seaweed prevalent in the north Atlantic Ocean and was a favorite snack of Rogers when he was growing up.
“When I was a kid, we’d go up to New Brunswick every summer, get some dulse and hoard it for the next year,” Rogers said. “This was in the 1980s, so you couldn’t find it in Maine that easily. I loved it. I’d try to get my friends to try it, and they were pretty squeamish about it. It was super special to me, though.”
Rogers graduated from the University of Southern Maine in 1994, and shortly after that, he moved to New York City, where he was involved in professional food writing.
“I served as the senior editor at the Zagat Restaurant Guide,” Rogers said. “After that, I served as a content strategist at Google. I was working on dining and travel content for them.”
For the 12 years Rogers lived in New York City, his love of the ocean and of seaweed as an ingredient in food preparation remained strong.
“After I graduated college, I started seeing seaweed in health food stores a lot more,” Rogers said. “When I was in New York, I was missing that connection to the ocean and the smell of the sea.”
Rogers said he was drinking green tea one day and noticed that it smelled similar to the kelp he used as an ingredient in his food.
“I started researching whether there was a seaweed tea,” he said. “I found this Japanese tea where they crush seaweed into a fine powder and mix it with hot water, but it wasn’t tea in the traditional sense.”
In 2016, with his idea for seaweed tea in tow, Rogers quit his job at Google and moved back to Maine, where he began experimenting and developing tea blends with seaweed.
“Seaweed is this amazing nutrient-dense thing that is high in minerals, has omegas, essential amino acids and anti-inflammatories,” Rogers said. “A lot of people don’t realize that. My hope was that in a tea form, it might be easier to try.”
As Rogers’ seaweed tea experimentation began to outgrow his Portland home, he began to look for retail space in Portland.
“One of the things I was struggling with, in terms of starting a store, was that seaweed is already everywhere,” Rogers said. “It’s not just in health food stores anymore. It’s in Hannaford and other specialty stores, too, but people just don’t know it’s there. I wanted to find a way to showcase seaweed and literally put it on the map.”
On July 1, 2018, Rogers opened Heritage Seaweed in Portland. Six months later, he began to develop the idea for Seaweed Week.
He said that the idea for Seafood Week went back to the years he spent working for Zagat’s Restaurant Guide and at Google.
“I was surrounded by professional food writers and restaurant reviewers, and every summer, a fair amount of them would come up to Maine for vacation,” Rogers said. “They’d ask me where they could find the best lobster rolls or oysters. I was always aware that seaweed was not a part of that equation.
In December, Rogers said he reached out to the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, a group that had previously hosted weekly events called “Out of the Blue” during which restaurants would cook foods using under-utilized seafood.
“I wanted to use that as a template,” Rogers said. “I started reaching out to people in January, and from there, things went from zero to 60 really fast.”
Four months after Rogers began to organize the event, more than 50 restaurants, bars, breweries and distilleries have agreed to feature foods using seaweed as an ingredient on their menus.
Rogers said he wants Maine to be “one of the leaders” in popularizing seaweed in food and drinks.
“I want to be a part of creating a Maine brand around seaweed, the same way Maine has created a brand around lobsters,” Rogers said. “You can find lobster in other places, but you hear about Maine lobster the most. I want it to be the same way for seaweed.”
“In 10 to 20 years, I think we’re going to see a lot of seaweed products continuing to enter the retail market, and a lot of those will come from Maine,” Rogers said. “I want my store to be a place where those products can be seen by the public and tested.”

Full text: PORTLAND – John “Jack” Hartshorn Neal. In gratitude for his colorful and most eventful life of 87 years, the family of John Hartshorn Neal of Oxford, solemnly announces his passing on Friday, April 5, 2019 at the Maine Medical Center in Portland, following a brief illness.
Born in Portland, Ore. on Aug. 8, 1931 to Asa Ira Hartshorn and Helena Marcella Shade Hartshorn, John moved to Washington, D.C. in 1939 in a most unusual way. His mother Marcella was appointed to head FDR’s White House Library when the call came to report to Washington immediately. Staying behind with their grandmother, Ocie, Marcella’s two sons, John and Tom, age 8 and 6 respectively, later boarded a train from Oregon to the nation’s capital with only the train personnel and young John, of 8 years, to supervise the pair from west to east coast! John was given the last name of Neal when the boys were adopted by their mother’s second husband, Andrew Jackson Neal in 1941. He changed his middle name from Alfred to Hartshorn in 1976 to honor his father Asa and was known professionally as “Jack Neal.”
After attending Bethesda Chevy-Chase High School (BCC) in Bethesda, Md., John served in the U.S. Navy from 1949 to 1952, receiving the European Occupation Medal and the Good Conduct Medal. At discharge he was serving as a radarman aboard the USS Salem. He graduated from Boston University in 1955 with a B.S. in business administration, concentrating in mathematics and statistics. Shortly thereafter, he joined North American Aviation as a Reliability Engineer and was later promoted to Program Development Manager.
His career was spent primarily in the D.C. area where he built consulting firms, applying his knowledge of congressional and federal agency objectives on behalf of clients marketing information technology to the federal government. He formed Automated Systems Corporation in 1968 and sold the company in 1973. He joined Arthur Young & Co. as a director in 1974. He formed the AIH Systems Group, Inc. in 1977, continuing as a consultant after it was sold in 2001. In 2006 he founded the highly successful Deepwater Point LLC.
Beginning in 2001, John developed a special advisory relationship with SafeNet, Inc. Close friendships with company executives and their families ensued, and those friendships stayed strong after John’s retirement and the rest of his years.
John was an adventurous man who loved to travel. He especially welcomed opportunities to travel with his children. In 2007, following the sale of Deepwater Point, LLC, John and his partner, Linda, traveled around the world on the QE2. Their Thompson Lake home is filled with mementos of their many trips.
In his younger days, John was often found hunting ducks and geese on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. An avid fisherman he once took a break for a few months and worked on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska. He loved seafood and never missed an opportunity to eat lobster, oysters and scallops. Many of his birthday celebrations were enjoyed at lobster bakes.
Part Hemingway and part General Patton, John was a one-man, dynamo whose instant imprint on people was unforgettable. He was charged like a lightning bolt – exciting, daring and never boring.
Upon retirement, John made a tranquil home with Linda on Thompson Lake in Oxford. He loved the Maine surroundings and would often say it reminded him of Oregon. He joined the Oxford Hills Bridge Club and developed many warm friendships there. John also was a zealous cribbage player, always peppering his opponents with endless repartee.
John was particularly proud of his Hartshorn heritage. At the end of the first century the Hartshorns came from Saxony, Germany to remove the Roman army from England. John was a tenth generation descendant of Thomas Hartshorn who emigrated in 1635 from Reading, England to the Port of Lynn, Mass. where he petitioned the colony court for inland habitation of four square miles, called “Lynn Village” and in 1644, incorporated the town as Reading, after his native England home. Today, the area is known as Wakefield. John twice visited the town of Hartshorn, England, Darbieshire County, Sherwood Forest and was an active participant in Hartshorn family reunions. He belonged to both The Sons of the American Revolution and The Sons of Colonial New England. In 2003, John and his brother, Tom, published the second edition of the Hartshorn Genealogy, extending the descendants of Asa Ira Hartshorn through the twenty-first century.
John is survived by his partner of 24 years, Linda E. Smith; his daughters, Anita Marie Neal Doucette of Harwich, Mass., Karin Marcella Neal Doyle of Sutton, Mass., and Alexandra Hartshorn Neal-Saá of Alexandria, Va., his sons, Andrew Joseph Neal of Maine, Bruce Alfred Neal of Bethesda, Md., Christopher Carter Neal of Midway, Utah, Kevin Hall Neal of Kilmarnock, Va., and the late John Alfred Neal II; his brother, Col. Thomas Augustine Neal USAF Fighter Pilot of McLean, Va.; and 19 grandchildren; plus 22 great-grandchildren. His exuberance is deeply missed as John was deeply loved by many.
A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on June 1, at St. Catherine of Sienna Church, 32 Paris St., Norway, ME 04268. To share memories and online condolences with the family; please go to www.chandlerfunerals.com.

(This item shows a vast difference in the 26th president’s funeral and the more recent 41st president’s funeral.)
The body of Theodore Roosevelt was laid to rest today in a family cemetery plot witnessed by members of the family and a Congregational delegation and a group of two hundred neighbors, among them many school children, who had assembled at the grave while the service was in progress. As the out-door congregation recited the Lord’s prayer, retired Captain Archibald Roosevelt stood directly behind the clergymen at the head of the grave, while to the left and quite alone, was former President Taft. Other members of the family stood a few paces back from Captain Roosevelt, while the congressmen and people of Oyster Bay were positioned directly behind a delegation of Rough Riders at the foot of the grave.

Full text: DOVER, N.H. – We are saddened to report that Robert L. LaBrie, 88, of Dover, N.H., passed away peacefully on Friday, Dec. 7, 2018, surrounded by family and only six weeks after a diagnosis of advanced pancreatic cancer.
Robert (aka “Bob” aka “Beeba”) was born on Sept. 3, 1930 in Hartford, Conn. He was the son of Hormidas and Lauretta (Desfosses) LaBrie, of Lewiston. Robert was educated at Ste. Croix Elementary School and St. Dominic’s High School. Higher education was completed at Auburn Maine School of Commerce and Bentley College in Boston, Mass,, where he studied accounting and business.
In 1952, Robert married Theresa McGuigan at St. Peter and Paul’s Parish in Lewiston. They had two children, Paul and Patricia.
Robert served as a Marine during the Korean War, which set the tone for his lifelong sense of duty, exercise and adherence to honesty, order and routine. After his return from Korea, Robert began a very successful business career starting as an accountant with Eastern, Inc., a Maine statewide beer and wine distributor. Robert went on to own the distributorship and expand the business into soda bottling and sales with the purchase of Cocheco Bottling Company in Rochester, N.H., which, at one time, was the world’s largest bottler of Moxie.
Robert led a full life, and his love for boats and fishing were lifelong. After taking early retirement at the age of 53, Robert began a second career as a “gentleman lobsterman” on the tidal Piscataqua River in Dover, N.H. where he kept family and friends in good lobster and oyster supply. He was a downhill skier who, with his partner of 30 years, Maureen, traveled annually to Europe in pursuit of a good downhill experience. Robert was an avid runner, who, even after a serious bout with colon cancer in the late 1980s, ran a number of marathons well into his 60s, including the Marine Corps marathon in Washington D.C.
Robert was an incorrigible food experimenter, often working for months “Beebacizing” the perfect recipe. His lobster newburg sauce and award-winning apple pies are legendary. He famously developed Beeba Bread, a baguette which he continued to perfect with his grandson, Jonathan. He would dish out his special crepes as quickly as his grandchildren, and in recent years, his great-grandchildren, could consume them. Robert developed an original methodology for cooking whole pigs to perfection, a tradition the whole family continues.
Robert was a great influence on his children and grandchildren. He taught a young Paul how to navigate a boat in the fog and how to water ski. His daughter, Patricia, was Robert’s “sidekick” throughout their lives, whether it was keeping him company as a child while he cut wood at camp in the dead of winter or having many opportunities to spend warm and wonderful time together as adults.
To the chagrin of their parents, Robert taught his eight year old grandson, Jonathan, and five year old granddaughter, Erin, how to drive his old Jeep Wagoneer. During summer vacations, a young Erin, wearing an over-sized life jacket and waving at local Portsmouth tour boats, often served as Robert’s lobster boat “stern man.”
Robert is survived by Maureen Kelliher, his wife and soulmate. He is also survived by his son Paul LaBrie, and wife, Sharon, of West Gardiner, his daughter, Patricia LaBrie of Dover, N.H.; two sisters, Rita (LaBrie) Sabourin, and husband, Ronald, of Auburn, and Rejeanne (LaBrie) Cyr, and husband, Dr. Duane Cyr, of Bristol, Conn.; and two beloved grandchildren, Jonathan LaBrie, of Williston, Vt. and Erin (Houghton) Sullivan, and husband, John Sullivan, of Barrington, N.H. Robert also had two great-grandchildren, whom he adored, John Sullivan II and Brienne Sullivan.
Robert was predeceased by his younger brother, Raymond; and his first wife, Theresa.
Arrangements are in the care of Wiggin Purdy McCooey Dion Funeral Home in Dover, N.H. According to Robert’s wishes, there will be no funeral services. The family plans a spring memorial service.
The family wishes to thank Wentworth HomeCare and Hospice and give special thanks to Karen for her help and care.
In lieu of flowers or other gifts, please consider making a donation in Robert’s memory to Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Mass. at dana-farber.org (gastrointestinal cancer).

Are fresh mussels from the ocean a thing of the past?

Abstract: There are several factors that may be leading to their demise — increases in toxic algal blooms, stress reactions to warming water temperatures, and shell degradation due to increased acidity of seawater. By not creating and upholding policies to combat the cause of their demise — global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels — we are forgetting about the organisms that fed our ancestors and are a major part of our culture. If we don’t urge our elected officials to act now on reducing our greenhouse gas output and taking tangible steps to combat climate change, we will lose much more of our identity as a coastal state than erosion and flooding from rising sea levels.

Full text: As soon as I was old enough to scramble down to the tidal pools in front of my grandparent’s house in Harpswell, I was in charge of plucking fresh mussels off our front rocks for my grandmother to cook for dinner. I would come up just minutes later to the kitchen with barnacle-scraped feet, carrying buckets of the local delicacy. My Mimi would hand me a few quarters (much below market price I might add) and cook them in a white wine garlic broth served with toasted french bread.
There is a distinct relationship between my childhood and seafood. The sound of cracking open a lobster claw, the slight sting on my fingers as I squeeze a lemon wedge over a filet of cod, or the smell of mussels and broth simmering on the stove fill me with this unmistakable sense of nostalgia from being the barefooted toddler from the Gulf of Maine.
As a child, I took the abundance of our local creatures for granted, because now, close to two-decades later, there isn’t a single mussel to be seen all the way down the rocky peninsula.
In 2016, Maine fishermen caught only 1.8 million pounds of the local creature, compared to the typical 4 million pounds usually caught. There are several factors that may be leading to their demise — increases in toxic algal blooms, stress reactions to warming water temperatures, and shell degradation due to increased acidity of seawater.
Mussels are a humble organism. They do not carry the high economic and international fame that lobsters do, but they deserve to be recognized as an important local species that is slipping through the cracks due to climate change.
Like any species, including humans, consistently living in an environment that is slightly too warm or slightly too cold produces stress reactions, decreases efficiency of immune systems, and leaves the organism very susceptible to disease and predation. Their compromised immune system immune system makes them more vulnerable to toxic algal blooms, and the higher acidity in the water, due to increased carbon dioxide, dissolves their shells.
It is easy for Mainers to not notice the absence of mussels on our granite coastlines, because they are still on the menus of their favorite restaurants. But that is because the mussel industry has shifted to an aquaculture fishery.
We need to combat climate change, not only because these organisms have intrinsic value of just existing within our coastal waters, but also because they have a cultural value. Across coastal New England, ancient Native American grounds and areas of our earliest settlers are littered with the pearlescent blue shells of mussels. The abundance of these bivalves fed our ancestors, and their remains are a part of the literal and figurative foundation of our New England society.
Their presence is a part of the memory of my childhood as well as my relationship with my family. Where will they be for my children? What other organisms will be missing from the tidal pools I spent so many hours playing in and inspired me to study marine science in college and graduate school?
By not creating and upholding policies to combat the cause of their demise — global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels — we are forgetting about the organisms that fed our ancestors and are a major part of our culture.
The mussel is one of dozens of organisms we are at risk of losing. If we don’t urge our elected officials to act now on reducing our greenhouse gas output and taking tangible steps to combat climate change, we will lose much more of our identity as a coastal state than erosion and flooding from rising sea levels.

Abstract: The list of things found on our dollars includes DNA from our pets, traces of drugs, and bacteria and viruses that cause disease. Bacteria that cause food-borne illness – including Salmonella and a pathogenic strain of E.coli – have been shown to survive on pennies, nickels and dimes and can hide out on ATM machines. Putting older bills through a machine that exposes them to carbon dioxide at a specific temperature and pressure can strip dollar bills of oils and dirt left behind by human fingers, while the heat kills microbes that would otherwise linger.

Full text: We live in a dirty world. Wherever we go, we are among microbes. Bacteria, fungi and viruses live on our phones, bus seats, door handles and park benches. We pass these tiny organisms to each other when we share a handshake or a seat on the plane.
Now, researchers are finding we also share our microbes through our money. From tip jars to vending machines to the meter maid – each dollar, passed person to person, samples a bit of the environment it comes from, and passes those bits to the next person, the next place it goes.
The list of things found on our dollars includes DNA from our pets, traces of drugs, and bacteria and viruses that cause disease.
The findings demonstrate how money can silently record human activities, leaving behind so-called “molecular echoes.”
What’s on a dollar bill?
Last April, a study identified over a hundred different strains of bacteria on dollar bills circulating in New York City. Some of the most common bugs on our bills included Propionibacterium acnes , a bacteria known to cause acne, and Streptococcus oralis , a common bacteria found in our mouths.
The research team, led by biologist Jane Carlton at New York University, also discovered traces of DNA from domestic animals and from specific bacteria that are associated only with certain foods.
A similar study recovered traces of DNA on ATM keypads, reflecting the foods people ate in different neighborhoods. People in central Harlem ate more domestic chicken than those in Flushing and Chinatown, who ate more species of bony fish and mollusks. The foods people ate transferred from fingers to touchscreens, where scientists could recover a bit of their most recent meals.
We don’t leave only food behind. Traces of cocaine can be found on almost 80 percent of dollar bills. Other drugs, including morphine, heroin, methamphetamine and amphetamine, can also be found on bills, though less commonly than cocaine.
Identifying foods people eat or the drugs people use based on interactions with money might not seem all that useful, but scientists are also using these types of data to understand patterns of disease. Most of the microbes the researchers in New York identified do not cause disease. But other studies have suggested that disease-causing strains of bacteria or virus could be passed along with our currency.
Bacteria that cause food-borne illness – including Salmonella and a pathogenic strain of E.coli – have been shown to survive on pennies, nickels and dimes and can hide out on ATM machines. Other bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which causes skin infections, are found on bank notes in the U.S. and Canada, but the extent to which they could spread infections is unknown.
Try as we may to avoid exposure to germs, they travel with us and on us. Even if disease-causing microbes can survive in places like ATMs, the good news is that most exposures don’t make us sick.
Money laundering
Disease transmission linked to money is rare, and no major disease outbreaks have started from our ATMs. Although it doesn’t seem common for diseases to transmit through money, there are ways we could make our money cleaner.
Researchers are working on ways to clean money between transactions. Putting older bills through a machine that exposes them to carbon dioxide at a specific temperature and pressure can strip dollar bills of oils and dirt left behind by human fingers, while the heat kills microbes that would otherwise linger.
U.S. money is still made from a blend of cotton and linen, which has been shown to have higher bacterial growth than plastic polymers. Several countries are transitioning from money made of natural fibers to plastic, which may be less friendly to bacteria. Canada has had plastic money since 2013, and the U.K. transitioned to a plastic-based bank note last year.
Even if our money is not directly responsible for spreading disease, we can still use the dollar’s travel history to track how we spread disease in other ways. The website WheresGeorge.com, created in 1998, lets users track dollar bills by recording their serial numbers. In the almost 20 years since the site’s creation, WheresGeorge has tracked the geographic locations of bills totaling over a billion dollars.
Now, physicists at the Max Planck Institute and University of California, Santa Barbara are using data from the WheresGeorge site to track epidemics. Information on human movement and contact rates from WheresGeorge was even used to predict the spread of the 2009 swine flu.

Trump’s ‘An American Budget’ is not good for Maine

Full text: President Donald Trump’s “An American Budget” proposes significant cuts to the FY 2019 budgets of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The data and information generated by these agencies are used extensively by Maine decision makers, scientists and communities to better understand the rapidly changing ocean and coastal zone.
Sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, we recently visited the offices of all four members of the Maine U.S. congressional delegation in Washington, D.C., to explain the impacts of such cuts on Maine. We are thankful that Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and Reps. Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin have a shared interest in protecting coastal resources and the state economies they represent. Maine depends on their continued support.
Effective management of Maine’s offshore and coastal fisheries relies, in part, on continued collection of marine environmental data, such as ocean temperature and water clarity. Much of this is done through satellite systems operated by NOAA through the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service.
In fact, NESDIS data have recently been used by Maine scientists to determine that the Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest warming water bodies on the planet and is experiencing longer summers. Those temperature shifts are associated with changes in both the number and location of key species such as lobster, cod, herring and haddock.
Such a rapidly changing ecosystem makes it challenging to manage these resources; doing so without critical monitoring data would be even harder.
NESDIS satellite systems provide rescue information to first responders and critical input to weather forecasters. Trump’s proposed cuts to NOAA include a 21.9 percent reduction in funding for the NESDIS.
“An American Budget” proposes to terminate four NASA missions that are essential for initiating and enabling long-term global observations of the oceans, ice, land surface and biosphere.
The PACE mission, for example, will provide unprecedented new data for measuring toxic algal blooms (think Red Tide). In addition, the PACE mission will measure atmospheric pollutants such as those generated from sources in the Midwest. These pollutants contribute to decreased air quality and increased public health issues for Mainers.
Trump’s budget proposes to eliminate the national Sea Grant program, a joint federal-state investment that supports the health and resilience of coastal communities.
In 2016-2017 alone, Maine Sea Grant activities generated an estimated $3.6 million in direct economic impacts. Sea Grant programs created or sustained 33 businesses and more than 30 jobs and provided 66 communities with technical assistance on sustainable development practices, including working waterfront preservation, coastal infrastructure and fishing industry diversification.
Maine Sea Grant worked with hundreds of industry, local, state and regional partners, and supported the education and training of 77 undergraduate and graduate students. The program achieved this with a congressional appropriation in FY 2016 of $1.2 million, which was used to generate $4 million in matching funds.
We are grateful for the support of the Sea Grant program by our congressional leaders in the FY 2018 budget, and hope they will support it again in FY 2019.
While in Washington, D.C., we asked our senators and representatives to further their support of the Digital Coast Act, which is a program intended to help local and state governments by providing coastal communities with up-to-date maps for better predicting and managing coastal hazards, restoring critical coastal ecosystems and planning smarter coastal development.
Storm damage is expensive. For example, prolonged storm energy and high tides in early March of this year due to a stalled nor’easter incurred costs of at least $2.75 million in York County alone. The Digital Coast Act will help our communities prepare for and adapt to sea level rise and increased storm activity.
We thank the Senate for unanimously approving this legislation in 2017, and urge the House to do the same, thereby making the Digital Coast Act law.
The Gulf of Maine is one of the most rapidly warming places in the global ocean. Scientists are still learning about the impacts of this warming on marine and coastal systems. Cutting funding to the programs that monitor and study these systems will not make these impacts go away. Indeed, such actions cloud our vision and place Maine in a highly vulnerable position.
President Trump’s “An American Budget” is not good for the citizens of Maine and we urge our congressional leaders to work together to oppose cuts to NOAA, NASA, and Sea Grant, and support passing the Digital Coast Act.

Full text: WARRENTON, Ore. — Gerald (Jerry) R. Boisvert died in Warrenton, Ore., on Jan. 28. He was born in Lewiston on April 11, 1950.
He is survived by his wife, Dolores Boisvert, of Warrenton; children, Barney Boisvert (Sherwood, Ore.) and Peggy Boisvert (Astoria, Ore.); grandchildren, Nikolai, Lindsay, Gabriel and Emery Boisvert; brother, Thomas Boisvert (Northfield, Mass.); and sister, Renée Boisvert Patterson (Fresno, Calif.). His parents, Wilfred L. Boisvert and Bernadette V. Boisvert, and sister, Susan Boisvert Lord, predeceased Jerry.
Growing up in Lewiston, Jerry attended local schools and graduated from St. Dominic Regional High School in 1968. Jerry was a competitive and entrepreneurial child; he played baseball and began playing soccer in high school, earning soccer awards in high school and college. For many years, Jerry and his brother delivered newspapers for the Lewiston Daily Sun; Jerry expanded the newspaper route into summer and winter jobs in the community: mowing lawns, shoveling snow, and caring for homes.
Upon graduating from high school, Jerry began committing himself to the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. He attended Providence College, in Providence, R.I., and after graduating from Providence in 1972, Jerry spent a year as a novitiate with the Brothers. Jerry chose to leave the order in 1973 and began a solo trip across the United States, taking odd jobs to fund his travel.
With a broken-down car, Jerry landed in South Bend, Wash., in 1974. He entered the fishery business, working for Coast Oyster and later for Point Adams Packing Co. in Chignik, Ala., where he met his future wife. They were married in Seattle on July 10, 1976. Jerry continued to work in fisheries, retiring from Pacific Coast Seafood in 2017.
Jerry brought his coaching instincts and love of soccer to Warrenton, where he helped found the Lower Columbia Youth Soccer Association (LCYSA) in 1984. He, along with a group of volunteers, slowly built the Warrenton Soccer Complex while facilitating, coaching and officiating soccer at all levels. In January of this year he was awarded the “Jimmy Conway Lifetime Achievement Award” from the Oregon Youth Soccer Association.
Beyond his love of family and commitment to work, the Warrenton soccer fields were Jerry’s passion. He could be found there daily: mowing, digging, lining fields, trapping moles, repairing nets, spreading fertilizer, moving rocks and logs to create parking, planning, building and “putz-ing.” When choosing equipment for the playground, he chose toys that he himself would play on. He was always the biggest kid on the field.
A celebration of Jerry’s life was held Sunday, Feb. 4, at the Astoria High School Auditorium. It was Jerry’s request that an LCYSA player scholarship be established; donations made to: LCYSA Soccer, P.O. Box 457, Warrenton, OR 97146, in Jerry’s name, will be earmarked for that purpose.

Full text: A recent closure of Casco Bay shellfish beds reflects changes occurring in Casco Bay. There is no way to predict exactly how this will play out. What we know is that historical patterns of fishing will change. People will be out of work, and the culture and traditions of the people that depend on a healthy, somewhat predictable ocean will erode.
Casco Bay is warming faster than 99 percent of the world’s oceans. Acidification and the colonization of warm-water predators are diminishing the native species that populate the bay. Scientists are in agreement about the role that the burning of fossil fuels plays in precipitating these changes.
It is time for elected officials to support legislation aimed at tackling the causes of climate change. The bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus mission is to promote actions aimed at reducing the risk of continued climate change.
I call on Rep. Bruce Poliquin to join with a Democratic representative in becoming a member of the caucus. A fee on carbon with revenue returned to households finds support among conservatives and businesses. Poliquin has expressed the desire to clean up the environment. Recently, he spoke on the House floor on behalf of the Brownfields Program. Cleaning up from past environmental insults is important, but the worst insult of all has been to the earth’s climate and, it follows, the future quality of life on our planet.
Let’s put aside differences and work together to find solutions to a common threat.

Leavitt test scores disappoint board

Full text: GREENE -- SAD 52 directors were disappointed by standardized test results showing high school scores below the state averages in math and science and only slightly above in English/language arts.
Assistant Superintendent Theresa Gillis presented an overview of test results from the Maine Assessment & Accountability Reporting System showing the percentage of students performing at or above state expectations.
The average scores on SATs taken last year by juniors at Leavitt Area High School, compared to state averages, were:
* Mathematics: state, 38.54 percent proficient; LAHS, 35.94 percent.
* Science: state, 61.07 percent proficient; LAHS, 50.78 percent.
* English/language arts: state, 52.28 percent proficient; LAHS, 54.69 percent.
"I am not impressed with what we are seeing here," Director Peter Ricker of Turner said. "We spend a lot of money in this district, and we should be striving to be above the state average."
Board Chairwoman Betsy Bullard said, "This is going to be the first of many conversations on the topic."
She asked Gillis to collect more information for the board to review. MAARS information is available online.
Directors also were unhappy with 2015-16 scores, which they saw for the first time Thursday night. Those scores, compared to state averages, were:
* Mathematics: state, 38.31 percent proficient; LAHS, 25.9 percent.
* Science: state, 60.97 percent proficient; LAHS, 42.03 percent.
* English/language arts: state, 50.58 percent proficient; LAHS 50.36 percent.
On the other hand, Leeds Central School and Tripp Middle School had consistently high numbers on the annual assessments taken last year.
In other business, Superintendent Kimberly Brandt presented information to the board on the new model for Child Development Services.
According to Brandt, services that are currently administered by the state would, under the new proposal, rest on the district.
The proposed legislation will be decided upon during the 2018 short session of the Maine Legislature, which if passed will effectively shift special education for 3- to 5-year-olds to school districts.
Under this model, all aspects of special education services for this age group would become the responsibility of the local district. This includes case management, evaluation, eligibility determination, individualized education program development, and the provision of special education and related services, according to the information presented by Brandt at Thursday's meeting.
Leavitt Area High School Principal Eben Shaw presented his school improvement plan to the school board. Highlights of the two-part plan include developing opportunities for students to demonstrate proficiency and increasing student engagement.
Shaw told the board a group of students participated in a lake monitoring program under the guidance of a marine biologist. Staff from SkindiversParadise instructed the students on safe diving techniques, which they used to assess Chinese mystery snails in Androscoggin Lake.
Students used the diving gear to collect buckets of snails, measured water depth and used gridwork to calculate the extent of the snail population. The large snails, which are about the size of golf balls, are considered invasive organisms. Native to Southeast Asia, they were brought to this country as a food source and are found in many Maine lakes and ponds.
Shaw said he was impressed with the attitude of staff and students when they "kept doing business as usual" during a 40-minute power outage one day and during problems with the water another day.
The board voted unanimously to increase the two pre-kindergarten education technician positions from part-time to full-time, and in another unanimous vote approved donations to the Tripp Middle School football team.

Feds clamp down on eel poaching as value grows

Full text: BREWER (AP) -- Changes in the worldwide fisheries industry have turned live baby American eels into a commodity that can fetch more than $2,000 a pound at the dock, but the big demand and big prices have spawned a black market that wildlife officials say is jeopardizing the species.
Law enforcement authorities have launched a crackdown on unlicensed eel fishermen and illicit sales along the East Coast.
Although not a well-known seafood item like the Maine lobster, wriggling baby eels, or elvers, are a fishery worth many millions of dollars. Elvers often are sold to Asian aquaculture companies to be raised to maturity and sold to the lucrative Japanese eel restaurant market.
But licensed U.S. fishermen complain poaching has become widespread, as prices have climbed in recent years. In response, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other agencies are investigating clandestine harvesting and sales.
Operation Broken Glass, a reference to the eels' glassy skin, has resulted in 15 guilty pleas for illegal trafficking of about $4 million worth of elvers. Two people are under indictment, and more indictments are expected.
In Maine, more than 400 licensed fishermen make their living fishing for elvers in rivers such as the Penobscot in Brewer and the Passagassawakeag in Belfast every spring. They say law enforcement is vital to protecting the eels and the volatile industry.
Randy Bushey, of Steuben, has been fishing for elvers since 1993. He said he saw his income balloon from as little as $5,000 per year in the 1990s to more than $350,000 in 2012. He said tighter quotas mean he's earning less these days, and in the most recent season he made about $57,000.
"I've seen the best, and I've seen the worst," Steuben said. "I want to see it preserved. I want to see it straightened out."
The elvers are legally harvested in the U.S. only in Maine and South Carolina. The American eel fishery was typically worth $1 million to $3 million per year until 2011, when the economics of the industry changed. Asian and European eel stocks dried up, and the value of American eels grew to more than $40 million in 2012 because of demand in China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
Investigators also turned their eyes to poaching in 2011, the Department of Justice told The Associated Press. The investigation of people who catch, sell or export elvers illegally has ranged from Maine to South Carolina; a New York seafood distributor was among those netted.
In one case, federal prosecutors said, three men pleaded guilty in November 2016 to trafficking more than $740,000 worth of elvers harvested illegally from the Cooper River in the Charleston, South Carolina, area. In another, Richard Austin pleaded guilty in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, to trafficking more than $189,000 in illegally harvested elvers from 2013 to 2015.
The federal agencies involved in the poaching investigations say there's no end date for their probe. The Department of Justice declined to speculate on how many poachers there are and how many arrests are expected. A conviction for violating the Lacey Act, which prohibits illegal wildlife trade, can carry a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of as much as $250,000.
Investigators go undercover to track poachers, posing as people illegally fishing for elvers. They also follow eel migrations, hoping to catch illegal fishermen on the spot. Investigators also track catch records, which are required by states, to look for possible illegal fishing and selling along the supply chain.
The legwork is necessary because illegal trade in elvers jeopardizes the species' long-term sustainability, said Jeffrey H. Wood, acting assistant attorney general with the Department of Justice's environmental division.
Maine's fishery for elvers is the biggest on the East Coast, making it the sole reliable source of the eels in the U.S. To prevent overfishing, fishermen are limited to catching them for only a few weeks every spring.
The eels hatch in the ocean waters of the Sargasso Sea, a weedy patch of the Atlantic Ocean between the West Indies and the Azores. They then follow currents back to rivers and streams from Greenland to Brazil. Mature eels that avoid hazards including fishermen's nets, predatory fish and the turbines of hydroelectric plants will one day return to spawn in the Sargasso.
The baby eels are tiny at the time of harvest, weighing only a few grams when they are scooped with dip-nets or trapped with larger nets that resemble small soccer goals.
A well-managed eel fishery is critical to the health of the rivers and streams they swim in, said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Deputy Chief of Law Enforcement Ed Grace. Eels are important to the marine ecosystem because they serve as both predator and prey, feeding on fish and mollusks and serving as food for larger fish, seabirds and turtles.
"While the big charismatic animals like bears, big cats and eagles tend to grab all the public attention, it's often the smaller, more obscure animals that are crucial to regional ecosystems and economies," Grace said.
Some eels harvested in Maine eventually return to the U.S. to be sold in Japanese restaurants, usually grilled and served on top of rice.
Sunny Chung, chef and owner at Yobo in Portland, gets Maine eels from American Unagi, the only American eel farm in the state. He described Maine eels as a top-notch product and "the only eel that we use."
Going after scofflaw fishermen will help ensure the eels keep filling that commercial role, said U.S. Rep. Jeffrey Pierce, a Republican from Dresden who's adviser to the Maine Elver Fishermen's Association.
"We are committed to ending these problems," Pierce said. "It behooves us to."

Full text: AUGUSTA (AP) -- Two recently enacted laws help the state's burgeoning aquaculture industry and those displaced by transportation projects in Maine.
AP file photo
More political coverage....
One of the laws creates a framework for all individuals growing and selling marine organisms as part of the growing field of agriculture. Most commercial aquaculturists are growing shellfish, and a state marine resources representative said aquaculturists face a very confusing licensing process.
The new law shepherded by Democratic Rep. Mick Devin creates a separate new aquaculture license.
The other new law increases moving and housing assistance for those impacted by transportation projects by making Maine law match a recent federal law.
The state transportation department said it's only fair that individuals whose properties are acquired receive the same amount of money regardless of whether such projects receive state or federal funding.

Full text: SCARBOROUGH (AP) -- The soft-shell clams that are harvested by hand and raked from the mud flats of Maine are becoming less plentiful, and the downward trend jeopardizes one of New England's oldest and most historic coastal industries.
Maine is the soft-shell clam capital of the country. But clammers harvested less than 1.5 million (0.68 million kilograms) pounds last year, the lowest total in a quarter century -- down from nearly 8 million pounds (3.6 million kilograms) at the industry's height in the late 1970s.
The clamming industry was once second only to lobsters in value among Maine fisheries. And clams are steeped in Maine lore, playing a role in Robert McCloskey's 1953 picture book "One Morning in Maine" and serving as the focal point of the Yarmouth Clam Festival that has welcomed thousands of people to the coast for more than 50 years.
"Last year was one of the lowest totals since the '50s," said Chad Coffin, a Freeport clammer who heads the Maine Clammers Association. "There's still areas of the coast right now where there just isn't a lot of clams."
Clams in Maine face of a number of threats, including an uptick in predation from green crabs and milky ribbon worms, and the increasing acidification of the ocean. Shellfish toxins also sometimes necessitate shellfish harvesting closures, as they did in the state's eastern coast last year and southern coast this year.
Despite all this, Maine soft-shell clam diggers are hopeful for a stronger summer this year. The clammers' association says it's hoping for a bounce-back year because many clams seem to be reaching legal size, Coffin said.
But stabilizing the industry for the long term will mean adapting to changing environmental conditions, said Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. The heightened predation from the crabs and worms has tracked in line with rising coastal water temperatures, which are predicted to keep rising, he said.
Beal said the predators are the biggest threat faced by the clams. One way for fishermen to cope with them is by employing strategies such as putting netting around areas of mud flats where clams grow and planting clam seed in protected areas, he said.
"If we don't adapt, we're going to be dead in the water," Beal said. "Unfortunately, our environment has changed."
The soft-shell clams are also known as "steamers" and they are often fried, used in chowder and, of course, steamed. They're a familiar sight in New England fish markets and grocery stores, where they are frequently sold fresh.
The clams are also harvested in smaller numbers in other states, including Massachusetts and New York. The catch has also dwindled in some of those states, such as Rhode Island, where clammers harvested barely 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilograms) of softshell clams in 2015 after frequently topping 100,000 pounds (45,359 kilograms) in the 2000s.
In Maine, state biologists are working on surveys and protection projects to try to preserve the clams, said Jeff Nichols, a spokesman for the state Department of Marine Resources. The number of clammers in the state has held steadily between 1,700 and 2,000 for most of the past ten years.
Coffin said he agrees with Beal that adaptation is key to reviving the industry before the crabs and worms make it impossible.
"It's not that there's not clams," he said. "It's that they don't survive."

Scott DeSimon
An editor at Bon Appetit magazine for five years, until 2016, he'll return to Maine from New York next month to be a judge in the World's Best Lobster Roll competition at the new Down East Lobster Roll Festival in Portland on July 8.
We picked his brains in the meantime on lobster, red hot dogs, food writing and the dish that made him say no way.
Name: Scott DeSimon
Age: 49
Lives: Brooklyn, New York
What was the career path that got you into magazine writing and to Bon Appetit? I was a musician and occasional film/video production assistant until I moved to New York with no clear purpose and fell into magazines completely by accident, first at Spin and then eventually as part of the launch team for ESPN Magazine. At the same time, I discovered that you could write food and drink pieces as a freelancer and people would pay you. I ended up contributing to magazines as diverse as GQ (I killed a chicken) and Mr. Food's Easy Cooking. I landed at Bon Appetit for the relaunch of the magazine in 2011 and stayed there for five years, editing, writing and producing video.
The farthest you've traveled for a food-related story or review? Not that far, actually. I think London and Mexico City are the farthest I've gone for a story, both about six hours, but Mexico City was really special because we got to work and shoot in this incredible Modernist masterpiece of a house -- a museum, really -- called Casa Barragan. We had the place to ourselves all day to cook and poke around and then put on a big dinner party on the roof. Kind of magical.
The funkiest or most "never again" cuisine you've ever written about? I'm not a big "adventure foods" guy. You won't find me ordering the live cobra heart or whatever. I will say that while I've never written about it, I just cannot get down with natto, the fermented Japanese tofu. I'm OK with extreme flavors, but flavors off of the spectrum like this are not my thing.
How about a classic Maine food rapid-fire? Your thoughts on:
Lobster: So long as it's not overcooked, I'm all in. Generally the simpler, the better. It's definitely become less "special" an ingredient, though, compared to when I was a kid. And I'm not on board with throwing lobster into dishes it has no reason being in. I'm looking at you lobster mac n' cheese. If there is any sign that the lobster harvest is too high, it's the existence of that. I will say, however, that if I have a little bit of meat left over, I will chop it and fold into the yolk mixture for deviled eggs in the summer.
Blueberries: Obviously the purplish, low-bush BB-sized ones from Maine barrens are a superior product to those massive, flavorless orbs that come out of Jersey and Michigan. Definitely worth picking through the stems and leaves to use. Love the blueberry cake recipe in Marjorie Standish's "Cooking Downeast," still.
Red hot dogs: I'll admit I haven't had these in a while, but until I was probably 10, I didn't know hot dogs were any other color. Ideally served sliced and baked on top of a pot of Jacob's cattle beans.
It's your first time judging a lobster roll competition. What will make the winner stand out? For me, the ideal roll is all about the perfect mix of mayo to perfectly cooked meat, with very little in the way of other ingredients or seasonings. And the bun needs to be hot and buttery, with a touch of crispness from the flat top. Simple, but so many people screw it up. Of course, if someone does some brilliant take on a lobster banh mi, I could be swayed.
Any lobster or lobster roll don'ts you've encountered? Most important: Don't overcook it. As for a roll? Don't mix sriracha into your mayo and don't serve the actual bun cold; the juxtaposition between the hot buttery roll and the cold lobster mixture is key.
You collect cookbooks. Is there a must-have for any Mainer? Not to repeat myself, but we had Marjorie Standish's "Cooking Downeast" growing up, and while there is a bit of the "add a can of cream of mushroom soup" vibe at times, it's still a great look into how people ate in Maine in the middle of the 20th century. And if you can find a copy of Robert Peter Tristam Coffin's book, "Mainstays of Maine," it's a fantastic read. That said, I know there are cookbooks in the works from a number of new Portland chefs and restaurateurs who have redefined Maine food in the past decade -- I'm thinking the folks from Hunt & Alpine Club as well as the team from Eventide Oyster Company -- and I'm really excited to see what they do.

Full text: PETERBOROUGH, N.H. -- C. Jerome "Jerry" Underwood, 88, of Peterborough, N.H., died peacefully May 1, at Summerhill Assisted Living, with his wife beside him.
C. Jerome Underwood
He was born in Oyster Bay, N.Y., on Sept. 18, 1928, the son of Dorothy (Hartshorn) and Clinton Jerome Underwood. He grew up in Gardner, Mass. As a youth, he enjoyed times with extended family and close friends, swimming, playing hockey and sailing. He won sailing trophies and built a sailboat that he donated to Camp Collier. Jerry graduated from Gardner High School in 1946, where he earned numerous varsity sports letters while he was on the baseball, football and swimming teams. He was senior class president, and was identified in the senior yearbook as "Best all around." He went on to post-graduate studies at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., where he graduated in 1947. He graduated from Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., in 1951. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1951, received training in the Russian language, and was stationed in Germany. He attended the Tuck School of Business following his honorable discharge in 1954.
Jerry was employed in the hardwood lumber industry for 45 years by The Atlantic Lumber Co., Kimberly-Clark Corp., and Bear Paw Lumber Corp. He presided over hardwood lumber sales throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.
Jerry married Doris Krauss in 1956. They resided in Verona and Cedar Grove, N.J.; Andover, Mass.; and Eaton, N.H. In Eaton, Jerry was a member of the Planning Board. Jerry and Doris retired to Peterborough to be closer to family and to the Underwood Farm, a family homestead since 1796 where he spent many hours playing as a child and maintaining its upkeep as an adult and swimming in nearby Gilmore Pond.
Jerry was generous and helped many people. He avoided the spotlight and focused on others' accomplishments. He enjoyed his daily walks around the neighborhood with Doris and their dog, Max, as well as the solitary pursuits of cutting trees with his chain saw and trimming brush. He rarely endured an idle moment. Many will remember his graciousness and the mischievous twinkle of his eyes.
He is survived by Doris, his wife of more than 60 years; his son Christopher and wife Fiona Bennie and their three sons, Campbell, Alistair and Tristan of Watertown, Mass.; son, Jerome, of Jaffrey, N.H.; three daughters, Kelly Lydon and her children Matthew and Chelsea of Geneva, Ill.; Michele Underwood of Corvallis, Mont., and Colorado Springs, Colo.; Kimberly Levy and her husband, Todd, of Austin, Texas, and their daughters, Sarah and Rachel; and by his cousins who remained dear to him throughout his life. He is predeceased by his sister, Deborah Brown.

The chef and owner Erin French got thousands of phone calls this year on April 1 when she opened reservations for the season for her 40-seat restaurant in an old mill in a tiny Maine town.

Calls came in so fast that it overwhelmed her three phone lines, which hold just 40 messages. Alarms went off when emergency lines to the fire department were blocked. "This is bigger than us," French posted on Facebook sometime after midnight. "Thousands of calls pouring in."
Word of mouth, a few magazine mentions and a Tastemade video that got 2 million views (and won a James Beard media award) have helped turned French into a culinary star. It's quite a triumph for a woman who grew up in Freedom, Maine, population 700, working in her dad's diner.
"The fear was no one was going to show up," French said. "Now the fear is there are too many people."
She's also got a cookbook coming out May 9 from Clarkson Potter called "The Lost Kitchen," offering recipes for everything from mussels to moose stew -- as well as the story of her unusual journey.
French started in 2010 with a $40-a-meal supper club in her apartment. At first, "I had to beg friends to come over," she said.
But word spread and by the fifth dinner, all her guests were strangers. She opened a restaurant with her husband in Belfast, Maine, but that business closed in a messy divorce.
She started over using a 1965 Airstream to give pop-up dinners. In 2014, she opened The Lost Kitchen in an abandoned 19th century mill that had been restored by a businessman who wanted to help the local economy. French's restaurant, using ingredients grown by local farmers, was the perfect tenant.
French, 36, has been featured by Martha Stewart, Food & Wine and L.L. Bean, which co-produced the Tastemade video and made her a brand ambassador. Still, she wasn't prepared for the avalanche of calls, from locals to folks from Texas, Alaska and Ireland. The calls were returned one by one until 1,500 reservations were filled for her May through New Year's Eve seatings.
Dinner at The Lost Kitchen, while pricey for Maine, wouldn't raise eyebrows in New York or Boston: $100 per person plus tax and tip for six to eight courses. The menu depends on what the farmers, fishermen and fields have to offer. A menu from last summer included tomato soup, melon salad, cheese, sea bass, corn, cherry tomatoes, baby fingerlings, arugula, polenta cake, grilled peaches and blackberries.
But The Lost Kitchen isn't just about food. "It's the mystery, the excitement," French said. "There's something a little scary. You don't know where you're going. You don't know what you're going to have for dinner. You're going on an adventure."
Lisa Eberhart came from Virginia to eat there. "You would never find this place," Eberhart said. "There's no lights on that road in the dark. It's in the middle of nowhere. There's no sign. You can't even see it. You're going through the woods over a footbridge. I said to my husband, 'This is the craziest thing.' But it was worth every bit of it. This to me was a once in a lifetime experience. It was magical."
Freedom does not permit restaurants to serve alcohol, but BYOB wine is permitted, so French's mother runs a wine shop onsite. With a staff of a half-dozen, French cooks and serves, and at some point each night, stands up to explain "how that menu came together." Then she gives thanks and toasts with her guests, "just as you would if you were at a friend's house."
Thomas Delle Donne, assistant dean at Johnson & Wales' College of Culinary Arts in Rhode Island, says The Lost Kitchen is part of a subculture: "These dinner clubs and pop-up restaurants and underground concepts play right into that celebrity status that chefs have. Having something private and in the know is like going to see a band play at an underground club where you have to know the drummer to get in."
French's story is particularly inspiring. "She lived in an Airstream, she came from the bottom and like a flower, burst back into this thing. It gives people hope," he said.
Success has brought invitations to expand. "You can have airport kiosks! You could be like Shake Shack with something on every corner!" French said. "I had 'Top Chef' call me and say, 'You'd be the strong female in the season.' And I said no. I'm being my authentic self. I literally started with nothing. I begged and borrowed. It's been a slow payback. But right now I'm surviving pretty well."

CHOWDER OF SWEET CLAMS
From "The Lost Kitchen" by Erin French
Servings: 4 to 6
5 pounds clams, either steamers or littlenecks
1 pound baby potatoes
Salt and pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving
6 shallots, thinly sliced
3 cups heavy cream
2 cups whole milk
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter
Juice of 1 lemon
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons fresh dill
Give the clams a good rinse under cold running water, discarding any with cracked shells, and put them in a large pot with a lid. Add 2 1/2 cups water to the pot, cover, and cook over high heat until the clams steam open, about 5 minutes. Drain and let cool to room temperature. Use an oyster or clam knife to shuck the clams, discarding any that didn't open. Reserve the clam meat.
Wipe out the pot and add the potatoes. Pour in just enough cold water to cover and season with salt. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat so the water simmers, and cook the potatoes until fork-tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes and let cool to room temperature before cutting into bite-sized pieces.
Return the pot to medium heat and add the olive oil and shallots. Cook, stirring frequently, until deeply caramelized, about 20 minutes. Add the potatoes, cream, milk, and butter and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the clams and lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for another minute, just to heat the clams through.
Remove the pot from the heat, sprinkle in the parsley and dill, drizzle with a bit of olive oil and serve.

For the sauce: In a medium sauce pot combine the chopped shallots and sherry wine; cook on high heat until reduced by half. Add the lobster stock and heavy cream. Reduce heat and simmer for a few minutes, then stir in a cornstarch slurry (a tablespoon of cornstarch blended in a tablespoon of water) and continue simmering and stirring until the mixture has thickened sufficiently to coat the back of a spoon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
For the topping: In a food processor combine panko crumbs, chips and crackers and grind until a consistent-sized crumb is achieved. Drizzle the melted butter evenly over bread crumbs and mix to blend.
Next, in a preheated saute pan on high heat, lightly brown the shrimp and scallops in the 2 tablespoons of butter, being careful not to cook the shellfish through. Remove from the heat and arrange the seafood evenly in four ramekins or other oven-safe dishes. Pour the sherry sauce over the seafood until it's barely covered, then sprinkle generously with the crumb topping. Bake in a preheated 375-degree oven for about 10 minutes, or until the topping has started to brown.
Garnish with lemon slices and fresh chives and serve immediately.
The reason? Tenants these days are loath to miss a meal at Schooner.
Small wonder. For one recent lunch, a succulent shrimp and scallop pie was the starring entree, but anyone not enamored with shellfish could choose turkey stew or three-meat pizza instead. Side dish selections were mashed or baked potatoes plus brussels sprouts, green beans and mashed butternut squash - all freshly prepared. One could usher in the meal with either clam chowder or a tomato caprese salad: slices of fresh mozzarella and tomato perched on a bed of mesclun greens, dressed with delicate ribbons of basil and a balsamic glaze. Dessert options included cherry cheesecake.
The mastermind behind all of this is Schooner's head chef, Seth Lyons. A 1996 graduate of the highly respected culinary arts program at Johnson and Wales University, Lyons spent several years first cooking at Maine coastal resorts, such the Asticou Inn of Northeast Harbor, and then at the Augusta Country Club before accepting a job as assistant director of dining services at Schooner in 2013. He took over as director in 2015.
Lyons has always believed top-quality, fresh ingredients to be the secret to good food. "Things don't have to be complicated to be good," he says. He points to his shrimp and scallop pie, a simple assemblage of shellfish and sauce under a crumb topping. It doesn't appear to be fancy, but after sampling a couple bites, this writer could imagine it coming out of the kitchen at a high-end gourmet restaurant.
That could be because the scallops came from Maine day-boat fishermen, meaning they were super fresh, having been caught and delivered to market on the same day. Or it could have been the sherry in the sauce. Eschewing the less expensive cooking-grade wine available in bulk through commercial food distributors, Lyons opts instead to custom-shop locally for his sherry (and marsala and madeira and port and brandy), saying, "If it's not good enough to drink, it's not good enough to cook with."
Apparently that philosophy works for Schooner resident Romeo Labbe. A huge fan of Lyons' haddock fillet with white wine and fresh dill sauce in particular, he vows, "I would eat live rattlesnake if it had that sauce on it!"
Chowder is another big favorite among Schooner tenants, with a variety of seafood and corn chowders all drawing enthusiastic plaudits. Credit here goes to another member of the culinary team, Brian Stone, who has earned a reputation as the establishment's master soup-'n'-chowder maker. And rightly so: His clam chowder - while simple - is definitely several notches above your basic offering, with a bounty of fresh clams, potatoes and celery bathed in a rich, velvety broth subtly infused with bay leaf and a hint of thyme.
Other tempting dishes found on a typical week's menu at Schooner include Dijon-crusted pork with herb gravy, chicken tortellini pomodoro, sesame-seared tuna steak, and beef tournedos with red wine and mushrooms.
Among the three different entree options offered for each meal, Lyons also makes it a point to provide such comfort-food favorites as meat loaf, chicken pot pie and beef stew, as well as - every Saturday - the old-time Maine staple of hot dogs, baked beans and brown bread. (The hot dogs alternate between red and brown from week to week in order to keep everybody happy, Lyons says, and prevent "a hot dog war.")
Lyons and his staff relish the chance to further flex their culinary creativity on holidays and other special occasions. Recently the kitchen let out all the stops with a Mardi Gras spread boasting over two dozen Louisiana-inspired items ranging from Creole potato salad and Cajun-rubbed roast sirloin of beef to shrimp jambalaya quiche and fried oysters with sauce remoulade. They even put a Southern spin on a couple of comfort classics with their gumbo pot pies and New Orleans macaroni and cheese, in which the pasta was enrobed in a sharp white cheddar sauce flecked with andouille sausage, tasso ham and red bell peppers.
Schooner resident Beverley Heath was still kicking herself a week later that she hadn't taken a second helping of the Mardi Gras mac and cheese. "It was wonderful," she said wistfully.
Although an enthusiastic "foodie," she hasn't elected to go on any of Schooner's restaurant trips in the two years that she has lived at the establishment. "Why would I go out to eat," she says, "when the food is so yummy here at Schooner?!"

Full text: BRUNSWICK -- A group of residents is suing the town after unsuccessfully petitioning the Town Council to create a park at 946 Mere Point Road.
The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Cumberland County Superior Court in Portland claims councilors failed to follow the town charter, which obligates them to send the decision to referendum.
The council voted 7-2 to dismiss the petition Feb. 6, with many councilors citing the town attorney's opinion that petitioners failed to follow a legal mechanism in the charter.
The lawsuit surprised councilors, who were unaware of it before petitioner Robert Baskett notified them during the public comment period of the Feb. 21 council meeting. Baskett also handed Town Manager John Eldridge a copy of the lawsuit.
The news, however, did not stop the council from authorizing terms of the sale of the property, which they voted 5-4 to sell last September.
Attorney David Lourie filed the complaint on behalf of the nonprofit Brunswick Citizens for Collaborative Government.
Petitioner Sockna Dice on Wednesday said the group raised funds for initial legal fees in one day last week.
"Now we feel it's not just an issue of the park, but the council stonewalling citizen input," she said.
The court filing argues that the petition followed a legal path defined in the charter, and that a decision for or against a park satisfies the definition of a "police power" ordinance. Therefore, it argues, the council had a legal obligation to enact the ordinance or send it to referendum.
The complaint also alleges council prejudice against the petition.
"The majority of the Town Council was prejudiced against the proposed ordinance, taking offense at the effort to effectively overrule the Town Council's order to sell the Mere Point property, although the Town Council never considered or voted on any motion to make the property at 946 Mere Point Road a park," the filing states.
Town attorney Stephen Langsdorf disagreed with the record of events and the argument.
After reviewing the filing Wednesday, Langsdorf said the content omits "essential facts" and parts of the record, and "doesn't highlight the provisions of the charter" that lack a channel for citizen petitions to overturn council executive actions.
It does not mention, for example, that the petitions were issued with a warning from Langsdorf that the council would not be legally obligated to respond.
"That's an important fact that they did not identify," he said.
The record matters, Langsdorf said, because a judge will ultimately review the history to determine whether the council acted improperly.
Neither Council Chairwoman Alison Harris nor Eldridge said they could respond to the petition Tuesday, and were openly perplexed as to why they were not notified in advance of the meeting.
"I'm not surprised by the substance; I'm surprised by how they went about it," Harris said, referring to the petitioners' prior threat to pursue legal action.
Dice said the group deliberately decided not to tell anyone about the lawsuit until Tuesday's meeting. She said they were concerned the council would bring its lawyer and create a "proxy court of law" during the meeting.
"We didn't mean to be disrespectful of the council, we just thought it would be pointless," she said.
The lawsuit does not seek to stay council action, although the document requests a stipulation that the town notify any potential buyer of the property that it is the subject of a court case.
Langsdorf said he will object to that stipulation.
"The statute talks about what you do when a case involves title to real estate," he said. "And there's nothing about this case that involves a title."
"There's nothing about this lawsuit that prevents the Town Council from moving forward with the sale," he said.
Councilors authorized the town manager to oversee the sale. The council must approve the listing and sale price.
A motion by Councilor Sarah Brayman for the town to retain a 25-foot strip on the south side of the property to create access for shellfish harvesters failed 4-4, with Councilor Dan Harris absent.
The council also decided against placing an easement for clammers on the property.

Gourmet ski grub at the Mountain Room.
Open for a month at Sunday River's mid-mountain North Peak Lodge, the fifth restaurant by the Portland chef, who owns a string of successful restaurants, such as the Grill Room and Corner Room, is perhaps his most ambitious yet. Ingredients arrive by Chondola and his kitchen resembles a ship's galley.
"It's like camping every day," said Smith, slicing bread baked in Portland for sourdough toast to which he'll add oxtail marmalade and truffled pecorino. Taking a break to take in the alpine scene all around, he smiles. "This is my new office."
Don't ski? No sweat. There is no charge to take the Chondola and trek through the snow to try pork belly buns prepared on high. Last Friday when we visited at high noon, the place was rocking. Smith was busy pressing Iowa ham and cheese into powerful paninis and loading up wooden boards with the finest smoked meats and local cheeses. The spread looked like a Swiss Alps mirage, New England style.
Skiers and families still chow down on typical fast fuel like soup bowls and nachos at the lodge cafeteria, but in the corner, the Mountain Room's black diamond fare is carved out with chef-driven focus. "On Saturdays it's like the Old Port Fest every weekend," said Smith, who splits his time between Boone's Fish House and his new perch this season.
As if on cue, a trio of Portland chefs arrived in ski togs and ordered up a feast. Sipping wine and beer, owners of Nosh and Eventide Oyster Co. gave it a thumbs up.
Taking over a section of the Peak Lodge that was underutilized, Smith is working on phase one. A bar in the center serves top-shelf booze and beers that go down nicely with meats, sandwiches and salads. The second phase, to be completed in time for the next ski season, includes full service dining and an expanded menu.
"The food is amazing," said skier Jeff Gray polishing off a bowl of tomato soup served with mini grilled cheese made with bacon jam and local goat cheese. "It's delicious and high end for a mountain."
The Mountain Room is open through April 1. Food is served Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Bar is open seven days a week.

Super-sized otters prowled prehistoric China

Full text: World, meet Siamogale melilutra.
S. melilutra was an otter. A really, really big otter. It weighed about 110 pounds and grew to be the size of a wolf. It had a powerful jaw and huge, rounded cheek teeth that were useful for wrenching large shellfish and mollusks out of their protective shells.
S. melilutra lived about 6.24 million years ago - more than 6 million years before the evolution of modern humans - and that's probably a good thing because S. melilutra could definitely take you in a fight.
The new species was described for the first time this week in the Journal of Systematic Paleontology, based on remains uncovered at Shuitangba, a fossil-rich mine in northern China.
Before this latest discovery, S. melilutra was known only by a few isolated teeth recovered in Thailand. Those scattered bits hinted at the impressiveness of this massive, furry creature. But they were not enough to identify it as a new species.
The new find included the creature's mandible, some teeth and limb bones, along with a complete cranium - a rarity in the fossil record.
"We were incredibly lucky to be able to find this," co-author Denise Su, the curator of paleobotany and paleoecology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, said in a video produced by the museum.
The remains were squashed during the fossilization process, but researchers were able to CT scan the flattened fragments and reconstruct them virtually, revealing a member of one of the oldest and most primitive lineages in the otter family. Though it's definitely a member of the otter family (Lutrinae), its features resembled those of badgers (whose Latin name is melus), so the researchers smashed together the two Latin terms to get the species name "melilutra."
At 110 pounds, S. melilutra was at least twice as big as the largest living otter species, the South American giant river otter, and four times as big as the North American river otter (i.e. Mrs. Otterton from the Disney movie "Zootopia").
The species' teeth, the cusps of which have low, rounded "bunodonts" rather than sharp peaks, are like those of pigs, bears and humans. Several other otter lineages also have these rounded cusps, prompting Su and her colleagues to wonder whether this trait was inherited from a common ancestor. But analysis of their evolutionary family tree suggested that the presence of bunodont teeth in several otter species is a consequence of convergent evolution -- different species independently evolving the same trait because they face similar environmental circumstances.
"The discovery of the otter helps solve some questions about otter relationships, but has opened the door to new questions," Xiaoming Wang, curator and head of vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, said in a statement.
For example, Wang said, scientists still don't why S. melilutra grew so large relative to its modern cousins, how it moved on water and land, or how it ate. Clearly, they otter learn more.

Full text:   HOUSTON (AP) -- Former President George H.W. Bush is still suffering from pneumonia, but is well enough to leave the intensive care unit at a Houston hospital, doctors said Monday. His wife, Barbara, has been discharged from the same facility after completing treatment for bronchitis.
The 92-year-old former president was struggling to breathe when he was admitted to the Houston Methodist Hospital Jan. 14. Last week, he was breathing with the aid of a ventilator in the ICU, but doctors removed the breathing tube on Friday and by Monday were talking about the possibility that he could return home soon.
Dr. Amy Mynderse said at a news conference that the former president is "sitting up, watching TV and is waiting anxiously for his favorite oyster stew for lunch."
"He's on minimal oxygen, joking and laughing with the nurses and doctors," she said.
Dr. Clint Doerr said Bush was still coughing "a fair amount" but that if he continues to improve, he could be discharged from the hospital by Friday or over the weekend.
"He's excited to get home and he's feeling well," Mynderse said.
Meanwhile, former first lady Barbara Bush, 91, who was admitted to the facility for treatment of bronchitis on Wednesday, is "back to her normal self," Mynderse said. Mrs. Bush was told she could return home Sunday but she opted to stay one more night to fully recover and remain close to her husband, according to family spokesman Jim McGrath.
The couple's 72-year marriage is the longest of any presidential couple in American history, and the doctors said they have been a great support to each other.
"They truly do have just such an amazing love for each other and that really came across here," Mynderse said, adding that Barbara Bush spent much her hospital stay by her husband's side.
"Part of why she ended up, I think, in the hospital was because even though she was ill, she was trying to be by his bedside all the time."
Doerr said: "They're essentially therapy for each other. They help and are compliant in terms of when one of them doesn't want to take a breathing treatment, the other says, 'Get on that.' It helps our cause."
Bush, who served as president from 1989 to 1993, has a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a motorized scooter or a wheelchair for mobility. He was hospitalized in 2015 in Maine after falling at his summer home and breaking a bone in his neck. He was also hospitalized in Houston the previous December for about a week for shortness of breath. He spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues.
The former president and his wife appear to have touched the medical staff with their humility.
Mynderse told reporters that when she informed the former president she would be speaking at a news conference Monday, he replied: "About what?"
"I said, 'About you!' And he said, 'People want to know about me?'" she said.
"They're so humble. They truly are the most humble people," Mynderse said.

#DoesItFart: Scientists build animal flatulence database

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]15 Jan 2017.

Abstract: "I don't know if animal flatulence questions can serve as a significant gateway to a greater appreciation of biodiversity, but it is always fun to see what captures people's attention," he said. "It is at least an opportunity to engage with a larger audience and bring new folks into the conversation." If engagement is the goal -- or at least a byproduct -- does it really matter what the topic is? "Just because it's flatulence doesn't mean it's inherently silly," said Adriana Lowe, a researcher of biological anthropology at the University of Kent in the United Kingdom. "The diets and digestive systems of animals are an important and fascinating field of study, and gas is just a part of that." Lowe studies chimpanzees in Uganda's Budongo forest, animals whose gas appears to vary with their diet. "Fruit is tootier than leaves, and figs seem to be the worst offenders," she said. On occasion, these bodily functions have even aided in her research. "Several times I have been with one or two chimps and not been aware others are nearby until the farts start," says Lowe. "Some of them have that very long, air-being-released-from-a-balloon quality, which is handy because it gives you a bit longer to pinpoint where it's coming from."

Full text:   Do baboons pass gas? What about salamanders? Millipedes?
These questions sound like the sort Bart Simpson might have asked to derail science class. But real-life scientists are now taking to Twitter to provide answers. So far, they've created a hashtag --#DoesItFart -- and a Google Spreadsheet that details the flatulence habits of more than 60 animals.
So, which animals cut the proverbial cheese? Tons, it turns out. Bats do, according to David Bennett, a Ph.D candidate at Queen Mary University of London. And the bigger they are, the harder they honk.
Rats, zebras and bearded dragons are also among those creatures that pass gas. Birds, on the other hand, do not seem to have a biological need to do so, but they could let one rip, theoretically. Marine invertebrates such as oysters, mussels and crabs? Alas, they are whoopee-impaired.
The science of flatulence is not just about potty humor, by the way. Cattle gas, for example, is a significant contributor to atmospheric methane that contributes to climate change. And fauna flatulence is also a hot topic among certain crowds - ones scientists want to engage.
"Does it fart?" is one of most frequent questions zoologists receive from kids, said Dani Rabaiotti of the Zoological Society of London. In fact, the whole #DoesItFart adventure started when her teenage brother asked if snakes ever experience flatulence. Rabaiotti knew from her own work that the wild dogs of Africa definitely pass gas, as do the extremely gassy seals that reside on the Atlantic island of South Georgia. But she wasn't sure about snakes, so she consulted snake expert David Steen.
The short answer is yes, says Steen, a wildlife ecologist at Auburn University. "Snakes sometimes discharge feces and musk as a defensive strategy, and this is often accompanied by what I would consider classic fart noises," he said.
Steen said this is far from the first time he's fielded this question, as it seems to be a favorite of the preteen crowd.
"I don't know if animal flatulence questions can serve as a significant gateway to a greater appreciation of biodiversity, but it is always fun to see what captures people's attention," he said. "It is at least an opportunity to engage with a larger audience and bring new folks into the conversation."
And if engagement is the goal -- or at least a byproduct -- does it really matter what the topic is?

"Some of them have that very long, air-being-released-from-a-balloon quality, which is handy because it gives you a bit longer to pinpoint where it's coming from."
#DoesItFart is only the latest in a series of spur-of-the-moment hashtags created by scientists and snickered at by the general public. (Such as: #JunkOff and #FieldWorkFail.) And then there are longer-running, single-scientist efforts, like the snake identifications Steen provides by way of the hashtags #NotACopperhead and #NotACottonmouth. Similarly, Michelle LaRue, a research ecologist at the University of Minnesota, hosts a game in which she posts pictures of cats big and small and asks followers to guess whether the animal is a #CougarOrNot. And Kaeli Swift, a Ph.D student at the University of Washington, orchestrates a game called #CrowOrNo. (Note: Both games are far more difficult than they might sound.)
At this point, I should probably tell you that I also have a hashtag. It's called #ButtOfWhat, and its premise is simple: Educate and entertain while talking about animal backsides. Is it a bit of a childish gimmick? Sure. But I guarantee you'll learn a thing or two by following along. (For instance, porcupine coitus involves a fair bit of screaming.)
This is also why I follow hashtag games like #DoesItFart -- every one is an opportunity to learn weird and wonderful facts about animals, and they can also provide a glimpse into the lives of scientists.
"When scientists can present these seemingly silly facts, it invites people to be part of what we know and to find out what we don't, which enables us to show how science works," said Cassandra Raby, a researcher with the Zoological Society of London, who confirms that baboons can drop some bombs. (Females with swollen genitals are the worst, by the way.)
You could also make the argument that diversions like these provide scientists with an chance to share data they might otherwise leave in a notebook.
"We spend a lot of time with our study organism and see some interesting or weird behaviors," said Nick Caruso, a researcher of salamanders (which do not pass gas) at the University of Alabama and creator of the open-access #DoesItFart spreadsheet. "This type of info, unless directly relevant to the study, may not make it into our publications and we don't always get a chance to talk about it."
So some people are interested in these games for the outreach or data collection they provide, while others just see them as good old fashioned fun. Me? I'm obviously in it for the butts. And I've already got my next topic lined up: Millipedes.
Whereas most animals that pass gas have soft, fleshy derrieres, millipedes have hard valves that probably act as silencers for their toots, said Angie Macias, a graduate student studying forest pathology at West Virginia University. What's more, research has shown that the arthropods create quite a bit of methane in their intestines, and that gas has only one place to go -- out the back.
"Put it all together, and I would say that millipede toots are probably very smelly, and definitely flammable," says Macias.
Silent, in other words. But potentially deadly.

Full text:   YARMOUTH -- When they're done taking a class, students typically move on from the associated assignments and projects.

Yarmouth High School sophomores Connor Senger, left, Ben Cox-Faxon, Clementine Blaschke, Grady Welsh and Duncan Birkbeck have been working for the past three years on a project to protect softshell clams.

Yarmouth students, who began working on a shellfish nursery project in seventh grade, received a grant from the Yarmouth Education Foundation last year to build a nursery tank, called an upweller, to grow clams.

Yarmouth High School students hold baby softshell clams they are raising to learn how to protect them from invasive species such as the European Green Crab. The group has won almost $50,000 by entering the project in competitions.
Five Yarmouth High School sophomores, however, are still working on a project they started three years ago in seventh grade.
"At the start of the project it seemed small," Connor Senger said. "We've turned it into something much bigger."
Senger and his peers, Duncan Birkbeck, Grady Welsh, Clementine Blaschke and Ben Cox-Faxon, have been working on ways to protect softshell clams from invasive species. The project is overseen by Morgan Cuthbert, the seventh-grade math and science teacher at Yarmouth Middle School.
The project started as an independent study by 15 students. The five sophomores who have continued with it have won two competitions with prizes totaling almost $50,000.
Most recently, the group won the first round of the Lexus Eco Challenge by Scholastic, which came with a $10,000 prize split between the group and the school. They were one of eight high school teams in the country to win and are now preparing to compete in the second round.
While in seventh grade, the group won the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Contest, for which Yarmouth Middle School received $35,000.
The students said they started the project because they wanted to protect clams from being destroyed by European green crabs.
"Naturally with Yarmouth and the Clam Festival, we wanted to focus on clams," Birkbeck said.
The past three years, the group has looked to various community members, clammers and fishermen, as well as Brian Beal of the Downeast Institute, as resources.
"Most of the time the answer is right in front of you when you thought it'd be really hard," Birkbeck said. "People in the community are very accessible and willing to help."
Cuthbert said he's happy to see the students engaging in a different way of learning.
"It's community-based learning that you don't always see in a typical classroom," he said. "It's been great to see this kind of learning."
Although he's no longer their teacher, Cuthbert still oversees the group. He said the students do most of the work, though, and maintain the project through the summer and on weekends.
The group members agreed with Cuthbert that the project has shown them a new way of learning.
"Instead of doing the same thing that's been done in every science classroom, we're doing something new," Welsh said. "We're pioneering this."
In April 2016, the group received a grant of almost $12,000 from the Yarmouth Education Foundation, which has allowed them to build an upweller at the Yarmouth Town Landing and purchase 250,000 clams.
"In a classroom you obviously don't put your hand in an upweller, pull out a silo, and come face-to-face with a juvenile clam," Birkbeck said.
An upweller a shallow tank with 16 silos that have a fine screen bottom that allows water to flow up into the silo. The water exits through a flow hole cut in the side of the silo near the top. It's used for nursery production of clans.
Cox-Faxon said he's enjoyed doing work that helps protect the clams, which in turn will help the clamming industry.
"You're working towards a goal much bigger than a grade you're going to get," he said. "You're working for your community."
The work being done by the sophomores is also benefiting their younger peers. Cuthbert said the project is now part of his seventh-grade curriculum.
"Part of the reason I think the (foundation) grant went through is because it'll have an impact on the greater school system," he said.
The sophomores said they hope younger students are interested in helping with, and eventually continuing, their work.
"We've spent a lot of time working with leaders in our community, but we haven't really thought about how we've become leaders," Cox-Faxon said. "I hope this inspires younger students."
The clams, of which approximately 125,000 remain, are wintering at the Chebeague Island Ferry Terminal. Cuthbert said the clams have grown from little "specks" this past summer to a couple of centimeters in size.
Building the upweller and keeping them underwater in a suspended bag has required the students to get town permits. In addition to learning how to work with local officials and community members, Birkbeck said he and the group have learned "how to effectively find an answer."
"Mr. Cuthbert taught us the scientific method so we can find things out ourselves," he said.
The students said what the project and Cuthbert have taught them are lessons that will guide their lives and future careers.
"Mr. Cuthbert has taught us a love of science, for sure," Welsh said.
Cuthbert said he's happy to have inspired this passion for science and discovery. He said he's proud not only of the competitions the students have won, but of their reason for doing the project.
"These guys would have done the work without the challenges," Cuthbert said. "What they've taken away and learned from this has been their greatest reward."

Full text:   FALMOUTH -- Donald "Don" Meakin, 71, of Round Pond passed away on Monday, Dec. 19, at Sedgewood Commons in Falmouth.
Donald "Don" Meakin
Born on April 8, 1945, in Darby, Pa., to Lawrence W. and Dorothy B. Meakin, he grew up in Yeadon, Pa., where he attended local schools. Many of his childhood summers were enjoyed in Round Pond, where his grandparents lived. He passed many hours happily rowing around the harbor and helping his grandfather on his lobster boat.
After high school, Don went to Penn State University. He became a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity and made many lifelong friends there. He received a bachelor's degree in business in 1967. During summers, while he was in college, he worked for the Naval Air Engineering Systems in Philadelphia and for the Defense Contract Acquisition Region in Philadelphia. After graduation, Don was accepted in the Management Internship Program of the Navy Department in Washington, D.C. He attended OCS in Newport where he became an Ensign, then went to the Charleston Naval Base for mine warfare training before reporting to the USS Gallant in Long Beach, Calif. He served on the Gallant in Vietnam as Lieutenant JG from June 1969 to February 1970. After returning to Washington, Don worked in the Contract Development Program at Naval Air Systems Command in Washington, D.C. and earned an MBA from George Washington University.
Don moved to Round Pond in 1977 and worked as a Contract Negotiator and Contract Specialist at the Supervisor of Shipbuilding in Bath until his retirement in 1995. During this time, Don enjoyed his family, woodworking, gardening and skiing with his children. He took any chance he could to go sailing. As one of the founding members of the Cabedetis Boat Club, sailboat racing was a passion and many special times were spent on the water with family and friends.
He volunteered as a first responder, and served with Bristol Fire and Rescue in Round Pond for 32 years. Don was a valued member of a men's group in Damariscotta for more than 20 years, and his love, support and participation enhanced the lives of all whom he met in this community. Don began construction of a new house in Round Pond in 1990, a special project that occupied many hours of his time.
After retirement, Don pursued many interesting jobs working for friends: oystering, building furniture, boat maintenance and boat hauling. He particularly liked driving the crane truck. Throughout his life, his woodlot gave him as much pleasure as anything. During this time he married Jean Piper, with whom he spent several happy years sailing, traveling and spending time with friends and family.
Don's warmth and easygoing nature won him loyal friends wherever he went. He could find the humor in the most trying experiences, and his calm attitude under pressure was appreciated by all. He was predeceased by his father and mother, Lawrence and Dorothy Meakin.
Don is survived by his wife, Jean Meakin; two children, Bill Meakin and his wife, Jessica, of Lisbon Falls, and Jennifer Meakin of Hollywood, Fla.; sister, Laura Elsworth and her husband, Richard of Columbus, Ohio; and two grandchildren, Violet and Rosalind Meakin.
His family would like to thank the amazing staff of Sedgewood Commons and Compassus Hospice for their outstanding care and dedication. He was loved as much there as in Round Pond.

Several henhouses in Livermore Falls have been raided in the last week, among them Hosea Pomeroy's on Knapp Street and W. A. Nason's on Park Street. The thieves got away with several fine birds, and Saturday night eight gallons of oysters did the disappearing act from the rear door of C. W. Moore's store at Main and Church streets.
50 years ago, 1966
The operational life of the Poland post office has been extended for at least another year. Barbara Strout, the concerned citizen who has led a lengthy drive to retain the facility despite U.S. Postal Service plans for its closing as of Nov. 30, said Friday that a lease for use of the one-story building has been signed with the owner. Expiration date for the rental at the corner of Route 26 and Poland Corner Road is Nov. 30, 1992, Strout said. The postal service decision to retain the facility pending further study came after Alexander Lazaroff, Portland postal official, released figures showing that the Poland post office is the only one of four in the town of Poland whose income exceeds expenses. The other post offices are in Poland Spring, East Poland and West Poland.
25 years ago, 1991
Plans were disclosed today for the construction of a multimillion-dollar shopping center on Minot Avenue, Auburn. David D. Cline of Newton, Mass., developer of other shopping centers throughout New England, told members of the Auburn Business Development Corp. that the complex "will be highlighted by a malled shopping area which will feature branches of national chains and local retail firms covering the broad spectrum of consumer needs." The proposed shopping center, to be known as Auburn Arcade, will be located on a twenty-acre parcel of land starting at the southeast corner of the intersection of Minot Avenue and the Hotel Road.

Abstract: I'm planning to take my stuffing, partially baked, in a pretty ovenproof dish suitable for serving. I'll cover the dish with parchment and then foil, so it's ready to pop in the oven to warm. Once it's uncovered, I'll drizzle it with drippings in those last few minutes before dinner. I'll make sure to bring my mother's antique stuffing spoon for serving, too. My Thanksgiving stuffing has a reputation; I've been making it for many years just as my mother made it before me. And this year, I might even make two versions. To make mushroom-celery-onion stuffing, melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 pound of mixed stemmed and sliced mushrooms. Increase the heat to medium-high; cook without stirring until the mushrooms have browned on one side, then toss to cook evenly. Add [1/4] teaspoon ground cayenne pepper and [1/4] cup brandy (may substitute sherry, vermouth, dry white wine or water), using a spatula to dislodge any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let cool, then add this mixture to the base ingredients and proceed with the recipe above.

Full text:   The Great Stuffing Incident of 1975 began the day before Thanksgiving. My mother casually announced that she was going to add dried apricots to the mix.
That displeased my brother. Speeches were made about the appropriateness of the combination. My mother, not one to back down, suggested that nuts were another form of tree fruit, and, as my brother had eaten stuffing with pecans, surely apricots were acceptable.
For The Washington Post
Herbed Challah Stuffing MUST CREDIT: Photo by Jennifer Chase for The Washington Post
A compromise was enacted, and two versions of stuffing appeared on the holiday table. From that moment forward, there was always a choice: "creative" or traditional.
Presented here is my adaptation of her flexible recipe, which just happens to fulfill the Bring It! mission of feeding a diverse crowd.
To start, the bread must be challah. Cut up and given a few days to dry out, the rich, eggy cubes absorb the stock and will puff up in the oven. They make for a consistently tender and flavorful stuffing; the top and the corners get deeply browned and crisp. They're so good, in fact, that we fight over those corners.
There are so many ways to customize this stuffing that borrowing a strategy attributed to Coco Chanel is in order: Choose as many additions as you wish, and then put some back. Too many flavors can ruin a good stuffing.
For aromatics: onions, leeks, shallots, celery.
For proteins and nuts: cooked, crumbled bacon or sausage, guanciale, pancetta, giblets, oysters, pecans, walnuts, chestnuts.
For fruits: apples, pears, dried cranberries.
For vegetables: carrots, parsnips, turnips, rutabaga, celeriac.
For mushrooms: cremini, shiitake, chanterelles, morels, porcini.
And, always, for fresh herbs: parsley, thyme, rosemary, sage, savory.
This year, for the first time in many years, I won't be hosting Thanksgiving. Instead, I plan to join the feast at a friend's bountiful table. As a guest, I want to be a help, not a hindrance, so I'll follow some traveling-with-holiday-food basics:
[bullet] If soup is your responsibility, bring it in a pot large enough to warm and serve it -- and don't forget the ladle. Ask your host if it would be helpful to bring bowls or sipping cups, too.
[bullet] A Thermos is the perfect travel container for gravy.
[bullet] To keep mashed potatoes hot, wrap their covered dish in a bath towel. Reheat in the oven or over a double boiler.
[bullet] Nestle a pie in a box lined with a dish towel.
[bullet] Responsible for the turkey? Tent it with foil and cart it over in its roasting pan. Those drippings should not be wasted. Ask the hosts whether they have a suitable carving board, fork, knife and serving platter, and, if not, offer to bring whatever they're missing.
[bullet] Tote all the elements for the salad in separate containers. Bring your own platter or bowl in which to assemble and serve it, and bring suitable utensils.
[bullet] Breads and rolls are appealing if placed in a small basket or decorative bowl that's lined with a pretty napkin.
The big takeaway: Don't expect the host to provide serving dishes, utensils or pots or pans. Take whatever is needed to get your dish to the table. If you need to use the oven or stove top, let the host know ahead of time.
I'm planning to take my stuffing, partially baked, in a pretty ovenproof dish suitable for serving. I'll cover the dish with parchment and then foil, so it's ready to pop in the oven to warm. Once it's uncovered, I'll drizzle it with drippings in those last few minutes before dinner.
I'll make sure to bring my mother's antique stuffing spoon for serving, too. My Thanksgiving stuffing has a reputation; I've been making it for many years just as my mother made it before me. And this year, I might even make two versions.
Herbed challah stuffing
12 servings
This recipe works as a base with three ways to customize, depending on your holiday crowd. For vegetarian options, see the variations below.
You'll need two 9-by-13-inch baking pans.
MAKE AHEAD: The bread cubes need to be left at room temperature to dry out for 3 days. The additions you choose may be prepared up to a day in advance. The stuffing can be assembled and refrigerated a day in advance.
From Washington area cookbook author Cathy Barrow.
Ingredients
For the base
One 1-pound unsliced challah (see headnote)
Leaves from 12 stems fresh thyme (about 3 tablespoons)
Leaves from 3 stems fresh rosemary, minced (about 1[1/2] tablespoons)
8 small sage leaves, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
[1/2] cup packed, chopped flat-leaf parsley
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pans
2 quarts no-salt-added vegetable or chicken or turkey broth
[1/2] cup turkey drippings or melted unsalted butter
For sausage-apple-onion stuffing
1 pound maple breakfast sausage, casings removed
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter
2 cups diced celery
2 cups diced onion
1 pound mixed apples, peeled, cored and diced (about 2 cups)
Steps
For the base: Cut the challah into 1[1/2]-inch cubes; leave them to air-dry in a large pan at room temperature for 3 days, tossing them a few times during that period.
Transfer to a very large mixing bowl along with the thyme, rosemary, sage, parsley, salt and pepper. Use your impeccably clean hands to combine. Pour the butter and broth over the bread and stir well without breaking it up too much.
For the sausage-apple-onion stuffing: Line a plate with paper towels.
Drop pinches of the sausage into a large, wide skillet. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, just until the sausage loses its raw look; do not brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to the lined plate.
Wipe out the skillet and return to medium heat; add 2 tablespoons of the butter. Once it has become melted and foamy, stir in the celery. Cook for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a mixing bowl.
Add 2 more tablespoons of the butter to the now-empty skillet; once it has melted, stir in the onions. Cook for about 5 minutes or until translucent. Transfer to the bowl with the celery.
Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the same skillet; once it has melted, stir in the apples. Cook for a few minutes, until slightly softened, then transfer to the same bowl.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease the baking pans with butter. Cut parchment paper to fit the pans and grease one side of the parchment with butter.
Add the cooked, drained sausage and the apple-onion mixture to the bread mixture, stirring gently to incorporate.
Fill the baking pans, pressing very gently to pack the stuffing in place. It will puff up slightly while cooking. Place the buttered side of the parchment directly on the surface of the stuffing, then cover tightly with aluminum foil.
Bake (middle rack) for 45 to 55 minutes. Remove the foil and parchment and drizzle the top of the stuffing with turkey drippings or melted butter. Slide the pans back in the oven, uncovered; bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until the top and edges are crisped.
To make mushroom-celery-onion stuffing, melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1 pound of mixed stemmed and sliced mushrooms. Increase the heat to medium-high; cook without stirring until the mushrooms have browned on one side, then toss to cook evenly. Add [1/4] teaspoon ground cayenne pepper and [1/4] cup brandy (may substitute sherry, vermouth, dry white wine or water), using a spatula to dislodge any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let cool, then add this mixture to the base ingredients and proceed with the recipe above.
To make apple-celery-pecan stuffing, omit the sausage in the sausage-apple-onion recipe, then follow the recipe to create the mixture. Add 1 to 2 cups toasted pecan halves (see NOTE) as the last step before combining with the base mixture and proceeding with the recipe above.
NOTE: To toast the pecan halves, spread them on a rimmed baking sheet and bake in a 325-degree oven just until fragrant and lightly browned. Cool completely before using.

Abstract: On Saturday, Nov. 5, the Sun Journal carried a letter from Tom Harris, executive director, International Climate Science Coalition. Stunningly, he denied man-made climate change. I Googled his organization and found that he had previously worked for the tobacco industry, denying the harmful effects of smoking, that he has a master's degree in English (but no scientific background) and the organization exists to deny climate change. Apparently, vested interests are willing to pay well for that sort of deceit.

Climate change means more than a milder winter; it brings rising sea levels (up to a foot in the next 15 years), changes in the forests and the loss of the maple sugar industry, ocean acidification that will make it difficult for mollusks to grow shells, while lobsters scurry north for colder water, and winter sports disappear. There will be droughts and forest fires, followed by periods of intense storms and flooding and reduced agricultural productivity.
While this will happen already, we can reduce the damage for future generations if everyone commits to using less fossil fuels. The economic savings in energy efficiency for cars, homes, businesses, schools and municipalities are enormous. The city of Lewiston took a strong lead in that, and it is using the methane from the city's landfill to generate power, rather than pollute.
People can do more and be better off financially as a result, while providing the best world possible for generations to come. Who doesn't want that for their grandchildren?

Abstract: "Many of us are baffled at the council's decision to force a sale when a vast majority of Brunswick voices clearly favored keeping the property for the benefit of all Brunswick residents," Colleen McKenna, one of the petitioners, said in a press release. "We want to have full transparency about the council's recent decision and the process going forward before the council makes any further decisions regarding the property." The group intends to collect signatures in support of a three-part ordinance that would require the town to retain the parcel; provide public access to the parcel as a park and for shellfish harvesting; and "assess the feasibility, cost, and fundraising opportunities to provide other uses of the parcel, including public water access." Consequently, what the petitioners hope and what [Stephen Langsdorf] must verify is that the petition satisfies a "police power ordinance," a procedure which is defined by the town charter, and exists to promote ordinances that secure all manners of public welfare.

Full text:   BRUNSWICK -- A group of residents hope to launch a petition drive to force the town to keep tax-acquired beachfront property at 946 Mere Point Road, which a divided Town Council voted to sell in September.
"Many of us are baffled at the council's decision to force a sale when a vast majority of Brunswick voices clearly favored keeping the property for the benefit of all Brunswick residents," Colleen McKenna, one of the petitioners, said in a press release. "We want to have full transparency about the council's recent decision and the process going forward before the council makes any further decisions regarding the property."
A request for petition papers -- sent to Council Chairwoman Sarah Brayman, Town Manager John Eldridge, and Town Clerk Fran Smith -- was submitted Monday afternoon, just hours before the council met and took action toward selling the property.
No mention of the petition was made during the council meeting.
The group intends to collect signatures in support of a three-part ordinance that would require the town to retain the parcel; provide public access to the parcel as a park and for shellfish harvesting; and "assess the feasibility, cost, and fundraising opportunities to provide other uses of the parcel, including public water access."
Before receiving petitions to fill out for the town clerk's office, the group must submit final language for the proposed ordinance.
The request was signed by residents Soxna Dice, of 3 Breckan Road; Anthony Yuodsnukis, of 276 Bunganuc Road; Scott Sehon, of 26 Thompson St.; Paul Nadell, of 4 Blue Heron Road, and Deborah Zorach, of 300 Maine St.
Yuodsnukis, the designated spokesman for the group, did not respond to a request for additional comment.
Town Clerk Fran Smith on Tuesday declined to discuss the specific request for petition papers, since it is under review by the town's attorney, Stephen Langsdorf.
Langsdorf on Tuesday said his review will investigate the legality of a petition where "the intent is clearly to overrule an order of the council."
While there is a process to nullify an ordinance, Langsdorf said the town charter does not outline a specific mechanism for the public to reverse a council order.
Consequently, what the petitioners hope and what Langsdorf must verify is that the petition satisfies a "police power ordinance," a procedure which is defined by the town charter, and exists to promote ordinances that secure all manners of public welfare.
Langsdorf said this is the first time a resident has attempted to use the process in his three years as the town's attorney.
Smith declined to comment on the petition specifically, but said during the referendum process, petitioners would have to collect signatures from 5 percent of the town's registered voters, based on when the petition is issued.
Smith said as of Monday afternoon, when the request for papers was received, the town had about 17,700 registered voters, so the group would need 886 signatures. That number is likely to change in the coming weeks as more voters register for the Nov. 8 election.
After the group collects the required number of signatures, the clerk's office will certify the petition to be reviewed by the council. After the council takes several mandated actions -- including a public hearing -- it will have the option to enact the ordinance or send it to referendum.
The group's press release said they plan to collect signatures on Election Day, if they receive the petition papers in time.
Council action
Meanwhile, the council on Monday continued along the path it set in September, when after months of deliberation and public hearings, it voted 5-4 to sell the property.
Councilors authorized Town Manager Eldridge to initiate the first step of the sale: the clear the title on the property through a "quiet" title action.
Eldridge recommended the town clear the title in order maximize the value of the sale: Potential buyers would be guaranteed that no one else has any legal claim to the property.
At the request of the town, Associated Appraisers of Maine appraised the property on Aug. 24 at $257,000.
The only other potential ownership interest in the property would be held by the former owner, Richard Nudd, who would have an opportunity to prove in court that the town was defective in its process of acquiring the property.
Attorney Kristin Collins has already assured the council in an Aug. 31 memo that the town followed the proper legal procedure when it foreclosed on the property in 2011.
Eldridge said the process would be "relatively quick," about two or three months, and that the legal fees would likely be $3,000 to $5,000.
The council has not yet discussed a potential walk-in right of way for shellfish harvesters, a consideration of which was stipulated in an approved Sept. 19 motion to the sell the land.
The council also approved a second motion that evening, which mandates that "any funds from the sale proceeds go back to fund water access needs after back taxes are paid."

Abstract: Part of the show's pre-wedding ritual is the presentation of a gift to your bride- or husband-to-be (whom you've never met) for a very first impression. So this week we went out on a quest: What would we buy our unseen husband-to-be, setting aside for a second that BL is already married and SS wouldn't marry a stranger for a jillion dollars? It's a little cute. It's a little kitschy. It's a Celtics' shamrock lightly scorched into your breakfast. This gift says, "I am full of surprises. And toast." This stuffed animal is about the size of a pony and, according to a little sign, it's named Jeff. (Or maybe it's on hold for Jeff? The slip of paper wasn't terribly specific. Not for nothing, Jeff is a great gecko name.)

Full text:   You cheer. You wince. And then you wonder: When is this fellow going to tell his brand new bride that he lives in a bus?
Precious Pearl kit for $9.99 at Office Max. Maybe save it for after the honeymoon.
Bag Lady and Shopping Siren are completely smitten with A&E's "Married at First Sight."
Like, SMITTEN.
Shopping Siren discovered the show last year and recommended it to BL, who then binge-watched two seasons to catch up. It's become a chocolate-level obsession.
The show's premise: A panel of experts match six pairs of strangers who agree to meet for the first time at the alter and get legally married, then have a camera crew follow them around for the next six weeks while they learn each others' names, likes, dislikes, habits and quirks.
At the end of six weeks, the couples meet back up with the experts to reveal whether they want to get a divorce or go the distance (you know, like staying married for another month, at least).
It's addictive. It's riveting. It's for hopeless romantics who also love a good train wreck.
Will your favorite couple share a passionate seduction? Will they crash and burn? (In all likelihood, yes and yes! Grab the popcorn.)
Part of the show's pre-wedding ritual is the presentation of a gift to your bride- or husband-to-be (whom you've never met) for a very first impression. So this week we went out on a quest: What would we buy our unseen husband-to-be, setting aside for a second that BL is already married and SS wouldn't marry a stranger for a jillion dollars?
Among the answers: Toast and not slime.
Blackie's Farm Stand, Auburn
BL's pick: Native wild blueberries, pint, $6.29
High in antioxidants, shows off state of Maine pride and perfect for pancakes, which anybody but a total jerk should like. (Everybody knows jerks don't like pancakes.) So really, win-win-win.
SS's pick: Canadian strawberries, quart, $6.49
Luscious, sweet and romantic as heck when dipped in chocolate and fed to your new spouse one at a time. Between nibbles you can take advantage of the quiet closeness to learn more about each other. Like, where are you from? And, what's your name again?
But not: Naked juices, 15.2 oz., $2.99
You've known this person for approximately 11 seconds. It's too soon for naked anything. Just . . . too soon.
Republic Jewelry
BL's pick: Boston Celtics toaster, $29.95
It's a little cute. It's a little kitschy. It's a Celtics' shamrock lightly scorched into your breakfast. This gift says, "I am full of surprises. And toast."
SS's pick: Giant green gecko, $24.95
This stuffed animal is about the size of a pony and, according to a little sign, it's named Jeff. (Or maybe it's on hold for Jeff? The slip of paper wasn't terribly specific. Not for nothing, Jeff is a great gecko name.)
For something more portable, Republic Jewelry also has an entire wall of Beanie Babies priced around $5 each or so. Whether a giant gecko or mini elephant, stuffed animals are adorable and fun, which says you're adorable and fun, which is the perfect kind of first impression to make.
Unlike the first impression of grilling your new spouse about his preferred definition of "occasional" in an effort to ferret out how often he "occasionally" smokes. We're talking to you, Heather-of-Season 4.
But not: Boston Red Sox pacifiers, set of two, $7.95
Again, too soon. No better way to freak out a stranger than to reference the baby you're going to have together.
Auto Zone
BL's pick: Autobot or Decepticon metal car decal, $12.99
Let your geek flag fly and hope he has a geek flag, too.
SS's pick: Tuff Stuff multipurpose foam cleaner, 22 ounces, $4.49
Shows you're committed to sticking things out, no matter how messy they get. A good guideline for marriage, arranged or otherwise.
But not: Slime tire sealant, $8.99-$10.99
In either spray or green gel (which we assume is extra slimy). It says, "We're going to break down a lot." It also says, "Slime." Hard pass.
Office Max
BL's pick: Small purple journal, $5.59
For chronicling your adventures together. The saying on the cover reads, "We are not here to wait for the storm to pass, but to learn to dance in the rain," which seems like the perfect sentiment when getting hitched to a stranger.
SS's pick: iPlanet mini cable selfie stick, $6
A modern TV marriage deserves a modern gift, so squeeze together, smile and commemorate this momentous occasion by snapping a cellphone picture. If he prints out the photo, you'll know it's love.
But not: Precious Pearl, $9.99
It's a pearl, in an oyster, in a can, in a box. As seen on TV. The pearl comes in one of five surprise colors, each color bearing a different meaning. Of which only one color -- black! -- means love. After cracking open the aforementioned box, then can, then oyster, your new spouse has to shove said pearl into the accompanying locket. Nothing about this is fun. And as we learned this season, some cultures consider pearls bad luck during weddings.
So skip the horrible omen and maybe write a heartfelt card instead? Something like, "Dear Husband, it's nice to meet you."

Bliss Thru Shopping: Pineland market marvelous

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]21 July 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1805992050?accountid=10457

Abstract: For sure, Pineland's been around for years, and although the 200-acre campus and 5,000-acre farms are a wonderland to behold, it's the market that's gotten our shopping hearts all a flutter. Think display after display of farm-fresh veggies, Pineland meats and cheeses, artisanal condiments. Made in Maine with ... wait for it ... zucchinis! Flavors range from classic to super hot "One Tire Fire" with habanero and scorpion peppers. We aren't sure we're up for scorpion peppers just now, but we'd be happy to try anything equivalent to lady bug peppers. The outside box that the 12 bags of kernels come packaged in is the same box that you'll stick in the microwave 12 times over to pop it. It has fewer additives than traditional microwave popcorn and a smaller carbon footprint (which we know is on your mind when you're getting ready to watch "House of Cards"). And it's made in New Hampshire, which is pretty sweet.

Full text:   There's a lot we love about Maine.
Pineland Farms cheddar cheese curd -- the snack you didn't know you wanted.
Zen Bear honey tea at the Pineland Farms market. Drop a spoonful in a mug of hot water, stir and drink -- it's easier than ordering at Starbucks. (At least the way Shopping Siren orders.)
Down-to-earth people. An abundance of friendly wildlife, most of which won't try to eat you. Water enough to kayak on/swim in/drink from, sometimes all at once.
And, now, Pineland Farms in New Gloucester.
For sure, Pineland's been around for years, and although the 200-acre campus and 5,000-acre farms are a wonderland to behold, it's the market that's gotten our shopping hearts all a flutter. Think display after display of farm-fresh veggies, Pineland meats and cheeses, artisanal condiments.
Also, pine cone angels. Knobs of stone. Cow-inspired baseball caps.
Because if you need a Maine gift, a Holstein hat would do it.
We could have happily wandered through the market and the attached deli for hours, eating our way through the morning and fulfilling our Christmas list 155 days early. It's. That. Good.
The other thing we love about Maine: Knobs of stone is not innuendo.
* Pineland Farms dried mushrooms, 1 oz., $4.99 to $5.99
Jars of dried portobello, shiitake or oyster mushrooms. For sprinkling in your homemade soup, pasta sauce or ice cream. Hey, it's a thing. We don't judge.
* Pineland Farms cheddar cheese curd, 8 oz., $4.99
Bite-size cheese that's probably a better snack than the potato chips Shopping Siren has in her desk drawer. Or the giant cookie she couldn't resist buying from the Pineland deli. Snack on.
* "The Wicked Good Book: A Guide to Maine Living" by Stephen Gleasner, $24.95
Anything that begins: "Chapter 1: Moose Defense 101" is aces in our book. We didn't stand there and read it, clearly opening ourselves up for attack.
* Stonewall Kitchen chocolate molten lava cake mix, $9.99
Because s'mores are, like, so last year.
* MooVM baseball cap, youth or adult, $19.99
Black and white (like a cow) hat with the Pineland Farms logo in red. According to the MooVM website, proceeds from hat sales help support the Keep Farms Local Fund and the Must Be the Milk campaign. Very moooving.
* Sunflower Hill Kids soap, 4-ounce bars, $5.99
Clear, unscented soap bars with tiny toys embedded in the center. Choices include a pirate or princess figurine, sparkly bracelet, high bounce ball or green dinosaur. Perfect hand-washing bribes. Or encouragement. However you want to say it.
* Galaxie Salsa, 16 oz., $7.99
Made in Maine with ... wait for it ... zucchinis! Flavors range from classic to super hot "One Tire Fire" with habanero and scorpion peppers. We aren't sure we're up for scorpion peppers just now, but we'd be happy to try anything equivalent to lady bug peppers.
* Go Real wooden utensils, various prices
Try the wooden measuring spoons with sweet little engraved birds ($13.99) or the honey-bee engraved wooden spatula ($6.99). So cute that you'll be looking for excuses to cook.
* Spices! Lots of 'em! by the Society of Shakers, $5.99
Adorable little tins with pickling spices, thyme, sage, cilantro. The classics. They're grown and picked just down the road. That's about as local as "locally grown" gets.
* Lake Champlain Chocolates, 3 oz., $3.49 (or go organic for $3.99)
Vermont-made and delicious-sounding: Dark chocolate, rum caramel, dark chocolate with almonds. Phew. Is it hungry in here or is it just us?
* Popzup reusable microwave popcorn containers and kernels, 2 lb., $14.99
The outside box that the 12 bags of kernels come packaged in is the same box that you'll stick in the microwave 12 times over to pop it. It has fewer additives than traditional microwave popcorn and a smaller carbon footprint (which we know is on your mind when you're getting ready to watch "House of Cards"). And it's made in New Hampshire, which is pretty sweet.
* Zen Bear honey tea, 8 ounces, $9.99
Made in Bath, this honey mixture is infused with herbs, spices and tea -- just drop a spoonful in a mug of hot water, stir and drink. As tea aficionados, we are intrigued. And also thirsty.
* Rock Candy Hardware beach stone knobs, $10
Drawer knobs and pulls made out of smooth stones. They're decidedly chic-rustic rather than corny-rustic, which is hard to pull off when you're talking about using rocks to open your kitchen cabinets.
Best find: Pine cone angel, $7.99
Palm-sized angels crafted out of Maine nature, including a pine cone body, milkweed pod wings and an acorn hat. Hang them on a string and it'll look like a charming woodland creature is floating through the living room. We don't know who wouldn't want that.
Think twice: About bypassing Pineland's market
It's too good not to go.

Abstract: Unfortunately, this was the antithesis of my free-spirited husband's idea of fun. In his mind, "all-inclusive" was code for "uninspired and predictable."

Full text:   Spontaneous change in vacation plans
leads to 'the best family vacation ever'
My husband prefers spontaneity to planning. For the first few years of our relationship, his wait-and-see approach led to an adventurous lifestyle that threw my risk-averse self so off balance, I fell head over heels.
Under his influence, and without commitments, anything was possible. Craving sea urchin pasta? Let's go to the new celebrity hot spot! Two-hour wait? Grab a drink at the speakeasy across the street. Wake up dreaming of the must-see musical? Cab it to the matinee. No seats? Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge! The world was our oyster, and we shucked it until our knuckles bled. (Literally, at an oyster farm up the San Francisco coast during a spur-of-the-moment drive, on a last-minute vacation, at sunset.)
He showed me a world full of the unexpected, and I grew to appreciate every last-minute thrill. My husband's unconventional ways eventually became mine, too. Within months, I settled in as his favorite co-navigator on the road to anywhere.
Pre-children, this lifestyle was glamorous! Fun! Exciting! The perfect choose-your-own-adventure love story. But just as midnight did to Cinderella's coach and gown, having children broke the spontaneity spell. The original realist came back, and now I was more cautious and prepared than ever.
Conversely, my prince remained unscathed. "Let's take the kids for a hike upstate. Maybe we can stay overnight?" he would haphazardly suggest on a chilly fall Sunday, when the leaves had begun to rust and crinkle underfoot.
I was incredulous . . . didn't he know? There were nap schedules, school schedules, babysitter schedules. There were movies that needed to be downloaded for long rides, clothes that needed to be packed. There were strollers and Ergos and backpacks to consider. Even the smallest of steps required careful, deliberate planning.
Planning was 'best' for everyone
I went from enjoying the unexpected to anxious stress in anticipation of the unexpected. Understandably, my husband did not fare well with this turn of events, and despite the strength of our marriage, it was hard to deny that we were creating a fissure exactly where we had once created a bond.
Most of the time I managed to quiet his protests with proof that my way of doing things was best for the family. When our daughter unexpectedly spiked a fever on vacation, I had Children's Advil in the suitcase. When our son threw up all over himself (and me) during a turbulent landing, I had a plastic bag for our soiled clothes and fresh everything for both of us. Tired? We'll be at the hotel by nap time. Hungry? Here, have some Cheddar Bunnies. I knew where we were going, when we would get there and what it would be like once we arrived.
It was exhausting to always be one step ahead, but I believed that, as a loving, responsible mother and wife, it was my job. So when it came time to think about our winter vacation I devised the perfect mental break: A week at an all-inclusive family-friendly hotel in Mexico. Even our dinner reservations and nightly entertainment would be planned for us.
Unfortunately, this was the antithesis of my free-spirited husband's idea of fun. In his mind, "all-inclusive" was code for "uninspired and predictable."
"How about Japan?" He hopefully suggested instead, but I quickly squashed that idea. Too far. Too unfamiliar. Too much jet-lag. Too cold. What would the kids eat?
I persuaded him that we needed an easy vacation where we could laze on the beach and (finally) not have to think about anything. I coerced him with the idea of reading a book while our children, 4 and 6, played at the hotel's kids' club. I enticed him with access to unlimited margaritas. Riviera Maya would be simple and luxurious. He loved me so much, he accepted.
Uh oh, passport is expired
Sometimes it's hard to determine if life is cruel or funny. The four of us driving to the airport was one of those times. My son was excited about leaving the country for his first memorable experience (he had no recollection of Jamaica nearly five years ago), and he was looking at the passports when he asked what the dates meant. He handed his back to me and a terrible acidic taste rose in my mouth. My son's passport would expire in two days. We were five minutes from the airport, and we couldn't go.
For all the pre-trip preparation - making sure their summer shoes still fit; buying sunscreen, bug spray, and anti-bacterial wipes; ensuring we had a spare cot, an ocean view and nightly dinner reservations - this was an epic fail.
"What do you mean we can't go?" my son cried.
"But I want to swim!" my daughter said.
My husband and I looked at each other and tried to keep it together in front of the kids. It was hammering sheets of freezing rain outside and our car was packed with summer clothes. The dog had been sent away, the house closed up. "I'm calling an audible," my up-for-anything husband announced. "Let's drive south."
Despite the control I constantly tried to impose upon my family, ironically it was the moment most out of my control that gave me clarity. It was like my husband and I had trained for this situation, and suddenly I felt my pre-kid muscle memory kick in. "Let's do it," I said.
Without snacks, one last potty trip, or audiobooks; without even a specific landing place or hotel reservation ... we drove. Our destination was "south." I felt a familiar thrill course through my body.
"Where are we going?" the kids asked as we passed the airport.
"On an adventure!" we answered.
My husband grinned at me, half with disbelief and half with recognition at the glimmer of the girl he fell in love with.
"I want to swim!" said our daughter, who apparently had one goal in mind.
"We promise, you will."
While my husband hit the road, I hit my iPhone, voraciously checking between Trip Advisor, bookings.com, and weather.com to find a destination. Miami was 20 hours away (too far), and there were no decent hotels left during high season (at a reasonable price). Still, I was not deterred. We had to save this trip.
Luckily for us, the country's weather was in a tailspin, which meant unseasonably warm temperatures in Northern Florida. "Ever been to Amelia Island?" I asked my husband. He had not. It would be the perfect adventure.
Destination: adventure
Several minor tantrums, a couple pit stops and seven hours later, we arrived in Nashville. We had never been there, and it was en route to our new found destination.
"Welcome to the Music City!" we told our kids in the morning. We ate the inn's homemade breakfast, we hiked, and we drove to the strip, where we listened to music spilling out of open doorways, tried on cowboy boots and devoured barbecue.
"Nashville is cool!" said my son.
"When can we swim?" asked my daughter. I slipped my fingers into my husband's palm. For the first time in too long, we were a team again. And we were winning.
Later that afternoon, during another 9.5 hour drive, I booked our second hotel. We knew nothing about Amelia Island except that the forecast for the next five days was sunny. "Have any rooms left?" I hopefully asked reservations as we passed through Georgia. We were in luck.
On a mission to find shark teeth? Time to go digging! Rather swim? Head to the pool. Craving seafood? Check out this place in town. An hour wait? Take a walk. No New Year's plans? There's going to be a mock countdown and fireworks at 7 p.m.!
With no agenda, anything was possible and we took full advantage. On the return drive north, we explored Savannah, traversing the idyllic squares and losing ourselves in history. Friends we had made along the way suggested we check out Asheville, N.C., and since we had no schedule, why not? We ended up in an amazing artists' community and our children watched in awe as the people around them painted, sculpted and blew glass.
"This is the best trip ever," my son said after every new experience.
"Did you see me swim?" my daughter added. I smiled gratefully at my husband, thankful for his partnership. As I allowed myself to enjoy the freedom of the unknown, I felt strangely at ease.
I had been so sure that my family needed an easy, thoughtless vacation, but we ended up with the complete opposite: A vacation full of discovery, not only of the unexpected treasures around us, but also of a forgotten bond between us. I couldn't have planned it better.

Abstract: Remove side muscle from the scallops if they have them, then rinse with cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Add the butter and oil to a large cast iron skillet placed over high heat. Generously salt and pepper the scallops. Once the butter/oil combo begins to smoke, gently add the scallops, making sure they are not touching. Sear scallops for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, not touching them at all while they're searing. The scallops should have a nice golden crust on each side and be translucent in the center when done. At The Dolphin, these are served over sweet potato mash and sauteed spinach, then finished with beurre blanc sauce. Whether spooning up that chowder, enjoying a basket of fried seafood or sampling seared scallops kissed with beurre blanc sauce, in my mind, dining at The Dolphin epitomizes what Maine is all about. It has it all: the incredible view, the iconic Maine food and the sense of being brought into the bosom of a family restaurant -- in this case the Saxton family, who, for 50 years, have been at the helm of The Dolphin. Now the matriarch of the family, [Mimi Saxton] is the glue and glitter of The Dolphin. Highly instrumental in bringing the business to its current level of success, Mimi's personality can be compared to the sun sparkling on that astounding ocean view beyond the restaurant's wide windows. She literally lights up the dining room as she glides table to table, chatting with repeat customers and those who are experiencing The Dolphin's hospitality for the very first time.

RECIPES
Pan-seared scallops with beurre blanc
Serves 2-3
1 pound sea scallops, patted dry
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
Freshly ground sea salt and black pepper to taste
Remove side muscle from the scallops if they have them, then rinse with cold water and pat dry with a paper towel. Add the butter and oil to a large cast iron skillet placed over high heat. Generously salt and pepper the scallops. Once the butter/oil combo begins to smoke, gently add the scallops, making sure they are not touching. Sear scallops for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, not touching them at all while they're searing. The scallops should have a nice golden crust on each side and be translucent in the center when done. At The Dolphin, these are served over sweet potato mash and sauteed spinach, then finished with beurre blanc sauce.
Beurre blanc sauce
1/2 cup beurre blanc reduction (see below)
1 tablespoon cream
1 pound cold butter
Salt to taste
In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook the reduction and cream together until thickened. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter a little at a time and allow to melt before adding more. Add salt to taste and strain through a chinois or a sieve with very fine mesh.
Beurre blanc reduction
4 cups white wine
1 cup rice wine vinegar
1/4 cup chopped shallots
1/4 cup chopped fresh thyme
In a medium saucepan, simmer over medium heat until liquid is reduced to a thick syrupy consistency.

Cilantro crema
Lime zest
Roll haddock in tempura batter and deep-fry in oil heated to 350 degrees until golden brown and crisp. Warm tortillas on a grill or in a skillet; place cheese slice and lettuce on each tortilla. Add haddock pieces and pico de gallo. Finish with cilantro crema, with a bit of lime zest. (See recipes below.)
Pico de gallo
Makes 4 cups.
4 cups diced tomatoes
1/2 cup chopped red onion
2 teaspoons chopped garlic
1 small jalapeno, seeded and chopped

1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons heavy cream
1 tablespoon fresh-squeezed lime juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
Salt and pepper to taste
Combine all ingredients and season to taste.
Grape-nuts custard
Serves 6
4 cups (1 quart) milk
1 cup Grape-Nuts cereal
4 large eggs
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla
Nutmeg
Whipped cream
Mix together milk, Grape-nuts and sugar in a glass bowl. Microwave until scalded. Slowly whisk in eggs and vanilla. Pour into a buttered 2-quart baking dish and dust with nutmeg. Place the casserole into a deep roasting pan. Place in the oven and pour water into the roasting pan, enough to reach halfway up the side of the casserole dish. Bake at 300 degrees for 45-60 minutes, until almost set in the center. It should jiggle slightly. Serve warm or chilled with whipped cream.
This summer marks my 30th year of driving down the now-familiar winding road for my fix of famous fish chowder, complemented with a cinnamon-sugar topped blueberry muffin. Just like the first time I set foot in the place, this wholesome meal warms my belly and puts me to rights like nothing else can.
Whether spooning up that chowder, enjoying a basket of fried seafood or sampling seared scallops kissed with beurre blanc sauce, in my mind, dining at The Dolphin epitomizes what Maine is all about. It has it all: the incredible view, the iconic Maine food and the sense of being brought into the bosom of a family restaurant -- in this case the Saxton family, who, for 50 years, have been at the helm of The Dolphin.
Five decades ago, The Dolphin was the spot in Potts Harbor to get gas for the boat and pick up marine supplies. But then Virginia "Jean" Saxton had an idea to feed the hungry fisherman coming and going on a daily basis. She joined forces with her husband, Malcolm, to build a coffee shop.
This was a place where local folks could expect to have a cuppa and a substantial breakfast. For lunch, there was buttery fish chowder with big hunks of haddock made with the recipe that is used to this day. The availability of wild blueberries right there on the point inspired Jean to keep her customers in blueberry pancakes, jam, pies and fresh muffins bursting with the fruit Maine is well-known for. Soon Jean was trotting out her family recipes, whipping up daily specials and baking a plethora of homemade pies, cakes and traditional desserts including Grape-nuts custard.
In the summer of 1970, a young girl named Mimi came to waitress at The Dolphin and married into the family two years later. She and Bill -- Jean and Malcolm's son -- went on to have three sons and a daughter, and then grandchildren. Over the years, Mimi and Bill took over more and more of the responsibility of running the place. Today, their daughter, Maureen Wilcox, and their sons Billy, Jeremy and Chris, and his wife, Maya, are all part of the business.
Now the matriarch of the family, Mimi is the glue and glitter of The Dolphin. Highly instrumental in bringing the business to its current level of success, Mimi's personality can be compared to the sun sparkling on that astounding ocean view beyond the restaurant's wide windows. She literally lights up the dining room as she glides table to table, chatting with repeat customers and those who are experiencing The Dolphin's hospitality for the very first time.
Mimi delights in showing off the well-placed memorabilia from the original restaurant, as well as pointing out new additions, such as the back deck with its intimate cluster of tables and its cushy sofa. Keeping up with the times is important, but more precious are the family stories -- and when you're at The Dolphin, you're considered part of that family.
Meanwhile, Chef Joseph Whitmore works behind the scenes with the kitchen staff, honoring the traditional recipes while also incorporating new dishes that may start as daily specials and eventually become menu standards.
Coming out of the kitchen are not only bowls of lobster stew and fish chowder, fried seafood and steamed lobster, but signature appetizers and entrees inspired by interactions with guests and what they want to eat. "Specials have become permanent menu items by popular demand," said Mimi.
The Dolphin staff also pride themselves on sourcing as many local ingredients as possible, depending on the season and availability. Purveyors include Brown's Trading Company, Native Maine Produce & Specialty Foods, Maine Shellfish Company and Casco Bay fishermen, as well as local farms.
These days, more than ever, a 50th anniversary is something to celebrate. Mimi credits the hard work of her family and all the restaurant's loyal customers.
"Our family all has strong ties to the business and the land here, but what is truly unique are the strong connections our guests have to it," Mimi said. "We love when they share their own memories about The Dolphin. To be a part of that is truly special. It's great motivation to always do and be better."

Mussels smell! Even though they don't have noses

Full text:   PORTLAND -- Mussels don't have noses, but two Maine scientists believe the dark shellfish rely on smells when choosing where to set up their homes.
The scientists say they have discovered that mussels use their ability to detect odor as very young larvae. They swim toward odors from adult mussels and away from odors from predators such as crabs, the scientists said.
Scott Morello, a visiting researcher at the University of Maine Darling Marine Center in Walpole, said he found that mussel larvae can recognize and respond to a broad range of odors when they decide where to settle in the wild.
He said exactly what part of the mussels is able to receive smells is unclear, but they likely learned to respond to odors through evolution due to years of being hunted by animals such as green crabs and dog whelks. And they can do this despite lacking a brain or cognitive ability, he said.
"They can smell, for all intents and purposes," Morello said. "They are doing everything they can so they don't end up settling near a predator."
Morello and Phil Yund, senior scientist at the Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research & Education, conducted the research. It was published in the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology in its July 2016 issue, which is out now.
The mussels show the same behavior in aquaculture settings, the scientists said. Mussels typically settle on hard surfaces, like rocks, in the wild.
Stephen Archer, a biogeochemist with Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences who was not involved in the study, said it's common for even very primitive organisms to react to chemical cues, like odor, in the ocean and coastal environments.
"A lot of organisms in the ocean react to these cues and use them to make choices to navigate," Archer said. "There's a lot of information there."

What you shouldn't store over the stove

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]27 Mar 2016.

Abstract: Q. I've really enjoyed making Joe Yonan's Scrappy Vegetable Broth. I'm surprised at how quickly I fill up those two zip-locks bags with vegetable trimmings, and I love repurposing the scraps that used to be tossed. My question: Are there any vegetables that are too strong-tasting to use? What about cauliflower cores, and the green stems on the outside, and red pepper stems? Q. I'm making a Yotam Ottolenghi recipe for Easter that calls for tahini, which I don't normally buy. I see Joyva brand everywhere, but I'm wondering if you have a preference you'd suggest instead. My own recipe is a little easier, I'd say, and it uses a higher proportion of chili. I got the basic technique and proportions from my friend Deb Samuels, who co-wrote "The Korean Table." You toss the cut-up cabbage with salt and let it sit until it exudes liquid and wilts, an hour or two, then you squeeze out the liquid. You whir together the chili and other ingredients in a food processor, then toss that with the chili, let it sit overnight, then move it to the fridge. In my first book, I threw an Asian pear in there, which I really like, and in "Eat Your Vegetables," I took it out because it's not always easy to find, and I offered the veg substitutes for the oyster and fish sauces.

Q. What foods can be stored without harm in the cupboard over the stove? The lower cupboard shelf is 30 inches above the stove top burners. I would like to use the cupboard for items used less often, such as larger containers of salt, flour, rice, canned goods. But a can of peaches stored there leaked all over, and I've no way of knowing whether the can was defective or heat from the burners caused the problem.
A.I store dried pastas, dried rice, dried chili peppers, cereal and salts in the short cabinet above my stove at home. You can make them easier to fetch by grouping them in fish tubs or other light and large containers.
I wouldn't recommend canned goods or flours: They're heavy, and the flours are better off in the freezer or refrigerator (again, in a container) for long-term storage.

Q. I've really enjoyed making Joe Yonan's Scrappy Vegetable Broth. I'm surprised at how quickly I fill up those two zip-locks bags with vegetable trimmings, and I love repurposing the scraps that used to be tossed. My question: Are there any vegetables that are too strong-tasting to use? What about cauliflower cores, and the green stems on the outside, and red pepper stems?
A. Glad you're onto this strategy. It keeps my kitchen humming.
Yes, some vegetables are probably too strong-tasting: I haven't had problems with cauliflower or red pepper, but some of the greens - kale, collards, mustard greens - I think would be too strong. Mushroom stems are amazing; just know that you might need to strain the stock if they're dirty.
Mostly, though, I think you can be pretty free-wheeling with this recipe, and just adjust and regroup for the next round if you want something different.
- Joe Yonan
Q. I'm making a Yotam Ottolenghi recipe for Easter that calls for tahini, which I don't normally buy. I see Joyva brand everywhere, but I'm wondering if you have a preference you'd suggest instead.
A. Al Arz, a Palestinian tahini, is the best one you can get in the United States. Its taste is wonderful. Other good ones are the Beirut or Lebanon brands, available in most Middle Eastern stores in our area.
In general, to choose a good tahini you just need to taste it. It has to be tasty enough that you would enjoy eating it directly from the jar. It should not be bitter. And it's one of the most wonderful and versatile ingredients there are.

Q. For someone who is unable to manage a fork, I need to find food she can eat with her fingers. I can do chunks of chicken or meat, but what can accompany it? Cherry tomatoes, chunks of cheese and cucumbers, but that is not a balanced meal, and in any case would get boring.
A. How about making a wrap? See our recipes for Avocado and White Bean Salad Wraps; Chicken Masala Wraps; Plantain Wraps With Tangy Black Bean Spread.
- Kara Elder
Q. Do you have a good recipe for making kimchi?
A. Yes, there are lots of recipes out there! We have a good one in our database: Napa Cabbage Kimchi.
My own recipe is a little easier, I'd say, and it uses a higher proportion of chili. I got the basic technique and proportions from my friend Deb Samuels, who co-wrote "The Korean Table." You toss the cut-up cabbage with salt and let it sit until it exudes liquid and wilts, an hour or two, then you squeeze out the liquid. You whir together the chili and other ingredients in a food processor, then toss that with the chili, let it sit overnight, then move it to the fridge. In my first book, I threw an Asian pear in there, which I really like, and in "Eat Your Vegetables," I took it out because it's not always easy to find, and I offered the veg substitutes for the oyster and fish sauces.

Q. Is it possible to smoke four pounds of a section of brisket in four hours, assuming an hour per pound? Or does the math not work that way?
A. Here's my advice: Skip the math.
Buy a cheap meat thermometer. When the brisket temperature hits about 185 or 190, pull the meat and let it rest for about an hour.

In spite of the snow and wind on Wednesday evening about 15 members of the Abend Club started for a long sleigh ride. The storm was so severe early in the evening that they went only as far as Frost Park where they decided they would spend the remainder of the evening. The evening was spent in playing games, singing, music and at a late hour Mr. and Mrs. Alonzo G. Frost served a delicious oyster stew. Mr. Frost brought the party back about 11 o'clock.

A larger, more elaborate Ward Bros. Inc. store will have its grand opening on Monday to climax a $400,000 expansion and remodeling program which began late last year. The well-known downtown store, which specializes in fashionable women's wear, has added a new department, expanded other departments and has installed new flooring, ceiling, lights and fixtures. "We have unlimited faith in the future of the Lisbon Street business district," said Israel M. Ward and Nathan A. Ward, co-founders of the business. The big expansion program involved the joining of two stores on Lisbon Street, the present Ward Brothers location as 72-76 Lisbon St. and the building formerly occupied by Top Value Enterprises at 70 Lisbon St.

Abstract: While some of the music is just for listening, the vast majority serves to fuel the feet of the hundreds of people who flock there each year for dancing offered nonstop from 7:30 p.m. to midnight on Friday, and 10 a.m. to midnight on Saturday. "The mainstay of the festival is traditional New England country dancing -- or 'contra dancing,' as it is more popularly known," says Lynn Plumb of the festival's planning committee, "but attendees can choose from a whole spectrum of other dance styles as well as music activities." In the auditorium, a Young Fiddlers Extravaganza from 1 to 3 p.m. will showcase the talents of string players from kindergarten up through high-school-age in four ensembles: the Pineland Fiddlers, the Oyster Creek Fiddlers, the Franklin County Fiddlers and the Maine Folque Co-op Fiddlers. A number of mini-concerts are also on the roster, featuring everything from Scottish to French to old-time Southern music, and there will be a selection of special activities for children and families, including arts and crafts and folk dancing.

Full text:   TOPSHAM -- Everything from fiddles and flutes to banjos and ukes will rattle the rafters at Mount Ararat Middle School and the Orion Performing Arts Center in Topsham when the 26th Annual DownEast Country Dance Festival takes place there March 25 and 26.
Submitted photo
The trio Nor'easter is one of 20 bands performing at the 26th Annual DownEast Country Dance Festival taking place on Friday and Saturday, March 25 and 26 at Mt. Ararat Middle School in Topsham.
While some of the music is just for listening, the vast majority serves to fuel the feet of the hundreds of people who flock there each year for dancing offered nonstop from 7:30 p.m. to midnight on Friday, and 10 a.m. to midnight on Saturday. "The mainstay of the festival is traditional New England country dancing -- or 'contra dancing,' as it is more popularly known," says Lynn Plumb of the festival's planning committee, "but attendees can choose from a whole spectrum of other dance styles as well as music activities."
Saturday is workshop day, offering beginner-friendly contra dance sessions as well as classes in English and Scottish country dancing, Irish set dancing, French Canadian step dancing, English morris dancing, French bourees and an array of other international dance styles from France, Israel, China and beyond. The art of couple dancing will also be covered with sessions in waltz, swing, tango and hambo.
Those looking to expand their musical horizons can learn how to play the bones or bodhran or pick up new techniques in fiddle, mandolin, piano or guitar styles. Also offered will be sing-along sessions as well as workshops in yodeling, round singing, harmonizing and vocal improvisation.
In the auditorium, a Young Fiddlers Extravaganza from 1 to 3 p.m. will showcase the talents of string players from kindergarten up through high-school-age in four ensembles: the Pineland Fiddlers, the Oyster Creek Fiddlers, the Franklin County Fiddlers and the Maine Folque Co-op Fiddlers. A number of mini-concerts are also on the roster, featuring everything from Scottish to French to old-time Southern music, and there will be a selection of special activities for children and families, including arts and crafts and folk dancing.
The two-day festival kicks off on Friday with a full evening of contra dancing in the Mount Ararat Middle School gym. Providing the music will be the Franklin County Fiddlers (7:30 p.m.) and Nor'easter (9:15 p.m.), with callers Kim Roberts and Linda Leslie, respectively.
On Saturday evening, dancers will have a choice between contra dancing to the bands Barefoot and Nor'easter (with Bill Olson and Linda Leslie calling), carousing at an international folk dance party, or indulging in some sultry Argentine tango dancing.
Admission prices for the DownEast Country Dance Festival range from $12 to $42, depending on the number of sessions one attends, with discounted tickets offered to full-time students age 11 to 21, and free admission to any child age 10 or under if accompanied by adult.
Mount Ararat Middle School and the adjacent Orion Performing Arts Center are located on Rte. 201 in Topsham. More information on the 26th Annual DownEast Country Dance Festival is available by calling 563-8953, or consulting the website www.deffa.org.

Full text:   LEWISTON -- Maine 2nd District U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin was lauded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce during the monthly breakfast meeting of the Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce on Thursday.
BDN - file photo
U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine
Poliquin, a Republican, was presented with the national business advocacy group's Spirit of Business award for his work and voting record in Congress during a short ceremony at the Franco Center in Lewiston's Little Canada neighborhood.
Poliquin is seeking re-election this year against Democratic challenger Emily Cain. Poliquin won the seat in a race against Cain in 2014.
Geoff O'Hara, vice president of Regional Affairs and Advocacy at the U.S. Chamber, presented the award to Poliquin, noting he had scored 95 out of 100 in the chamber's rating system for lawmakers. O'Hara said all lawmakers who scored at least a 70 were given the award, but Poliquin stood out for his high score.
"There are a million issues the congressman is doing a great job on," O'Hara said, but he specifically mentioned Poliquin's advocacy for tax cuts for individuals and businesses. He also said Poliquin stood with business on lowering energy costs, fighting for fair international trade practices, "helping to fix Obamacare" and advocating for improved transportation infrastructure.
The announcement was a surprise to Poliquin, who will be formally presented the award next week in Washington, D.C., O'Hara said.
Poliquin also addressed the chamber audience of about 300. He spoke for about 25 minutes and mentioned several of the myriad things he and his colleagues from Maine in Congress were working on.
"You don't hear a lot about this stuff," Poliquin quipped, in reference to Congress. "What you do hear about is that it's broken and it doesn't work. Well, I would like to add to that -- it's a mess."
He said trying to clean up that mess, however, was exactly why he ran for Congress. The first-term federal lawmaker, who replaced long-serving Democrat Mike Michaud, also noted he was carrying on some of Michaud's work -- not the least of which was pushing to require the U.S. military to equip its personnel with athletic footwear made in the U.S. and in Maine by New Balance, which employs about 900 workers in Norway, Skowhegan and Norridgewock.
"And we think it is really fair and right for the Pentagon to issue only fully American-made athletic shoes to fully made American men and women in uniform," Poliquin said.
Poliquin said later that the military equips recruits with everything from marching boots to underwear, but doesn't provide them with American-made athletic shoes and it should.
He also noted his work to improve federal inspection regimes for those who export sea urchins and sea cucumbers to markets in Asia. Poliquin said federal inspections at warehouses in New York were delaying shipments and spoiling a valuable commodity that is considered a delicacy in some countries. The industry in Maine provides employment for as many as 600 workers, including the sea divers who harvest them.
He said lobsters and other Maine shellfish were largely exempt from the inspections, which saved them time when shipping in the global marketplace.
"Don't pick on 'em," Poliquin said later. "They're little critters. Give them the same exemption you give lobsters."
He said the issue, which is being supported by all of Maine's lawmakers, including 1st District Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, looked like it was going to be solved.
He also noted that his office, along with those of U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King, have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate an issue involving the possible illegal dumping of a certain fabric material from China that competes with fabric made by Auburn Manufacturing -- a local company that employs about 50 workers.
In a summary at the beginning of his speech, Poliquin said his work in Washington was largely focused on one thing: "It's all about jobs -- it is flat-out all about jobs."

Bugs. It's what's for dinner

Full text:   Let's face it. You haven't eaten a bug since you were in third grade and your best friend dared you to do it. As far as you're concerned, eating bugs is fine on "Fear Factor," but here in the real world, you'll get your nutrition from the familiar bottles, cans and boxes you find at the supermarket, thank you very much.
Eating bugs: A word of caution
While "Survivorman" Les Stroud is known to eat any old bug that crawls out from under a rock, people who farm insects professionally have a few crucial pieces of advice: Know the source of the bugs you plan to eat. And, when in doubt, don't eat it.
Insects in the wild may have been exposed to pesticides and other toxins, experts say, and it can't be known how they've been feeding. They may carry bacteria or viruses you don't want to get familiar with. And they may produce poison.
"One should also never eat raw insects unless they've been bred and raised by a trusted source," according to the website InsectsAreFood.com, "because it is impossible to detect if a raw insect is tainted with pesticides."
Additionally, people with shellfish allergies should avoid eating insects until they know their tolerance levels.
Your best bet is to vet the source of your bugs before making a meal out of bugs. Don't just pick up the first bug you see and put it in your mouth. "Field and Stream" offers some additional words of wisdom, including:
"What to avoid? Pass on bugs that are covered in fuzz - bees and wasps are safe to eat if you remove their stingers. Beware of brightly colored insects, or for that matter any slow-moving insects that you find in the open; they don't give a damn about predators because they know they're poisonous. Disease-carrying species including flies, mosquitoes and ticks also are to be strictly avoided, as is any bug that emits a strong odor."
Extra! Extra! Newsroom staff hesitate to eat free food!
We set out a plate of mealworm cookies and a box of mealworm nut clusters in the Sun Journal newsroom, a place where most folks (you know who you are, sports department) will eat anything. There were takers, but it wasn't the usual rush of hungry news people.
"This actually just tastes like a good, sweet cookie," said Sun Journal web guru Carl Natale. "Once you get past the first step, it's not bad at all."
Managing Editor Judith Meyer, though, one of the bravest journalists in the game, would have none of it, even after she was told you can't taste the bugs.
"Yes," she said, "But you can SEE the bugs."
Photographer Russ Dillingham? No hesitation at all, especially given that his son is undergoing survival training and has had to perform much crazier feats.
"If my son can eat a bunny's eye," Dillingham said, "I think I can handle a few mealworms."
He had three of the cookies, one of the nut clusters and probably pocketed a few for later.
Managing Editor Mark Mogensen had a cookie - which is only fair, really, since he assigned this story.
"I couldn't even tell there were bugs in it," Mogensen said, an alleged vegetarian. "They blended in with the crunchiness. No discernible taste. For my virginal foray into the world of edible bugs, it wasn't too bad, but I have this desire to chirp now."
Sports reporter and editor Tony Blasi actually started munching on a cookie before pausing to wonder what was in it.
"I told him to look at the top of the cookie," Dillingham said. "Priceless. But he manned up and finished it."
But some newsroom folk not only declined to eat the snacks, they actually widened their berths when walking past the table.
Former Sun Journal cops reporter Doug McIntire declined to reacquaint with his old colleagues over buggy snacks.
"Even having a survival background," McIntire said, in response to a Facebook query, "me and the bugs have a deal: I don't eat them and they don't get me until I'm in the ground."
Pre-press Operator Randy Baril is a guy who will eat anything -- I once saw him take a bite out of a leather glove because it had a little steak sauce on it -- yet he wouldn't even consider eating one of the mealworm cookies. Not even close. Wouldn't even sniff it.
Me? I'm considered annoyingly fussy, yet I've found myself astounded by the almost universal aversion to insects among my colleagues. I sampled several of these snacks and didn't have a problem with any of them. I'll tell you this: I'll happily take mealworm cookies over carrots or green beans any old time.
For what it's worth, none of those who sampled the buggy fare at the newspaper were women. This probably doesn't mean anything since, back at the Junior Naturalists event, grown women and little girls went at the goods with abandon.
Who are the Junior Naturalists?
Sponsored by the Stanton Bird Club, the Junior Naturalists Club is an educational nature program for children in grades 2 to 6. Leaders conduct classes on a variety of natural science and environmental educational topics. Followup field trips in the Lewiston-Auburn area to explore natural habitats and make discoveries are part of each program. Guest speakers and special programs are frequent. The program's goal is to help children learn about nature and help them recognize the importance of their role in protecting our natural resources in Maine.

I've got news for you, Mr. Fussy Britches. You're already eating insects even if you don't think you are. Peanut butter? Tons of insect parts. Chocolate? Bug fragments everywhere. Canned fruit juice? You don't want to know.
The insect parts already in your food includes heads, legs and thoraxes. Nutrition experts suggest that the average person unintentionally ingests a pound of insects per year. It's a fact of life and you should get comfortable with it. In fact, a growing segment of the population suggests you should make insects a part of your regular diet.
"There are all sorts of good reasons to eat bugs," says Bill Broadbent, who, with his sister Susan, of Lewiston, runs Freeport-based bugsfordinner.com. "You may think it's a little bit gross, but how often do you look a cow in the face and think 'Gee, she looks delicious?'"
Good point, right? And the same could be said about lobster - how is THAT considered a delicacy while the humble cricket is shunned?
The fact is, edible insects prepared the right way aren't gross at all, and Broadbent spends much of his time trying to convince people of this very fact. A good way to get that message across is to gather a room full of people - kids, their siblings and their parents, mainly - and have them sample the fare.
That's exactly what was going on one recent January morning as the Junior Naturalists gathered to nibble on fare from Broadbent's online store and a few extras from Drew Desjardins, an educator known locally as Mr. Drew and His Animals Too.
On the menu from Broadbent's store: mealworm toffee, chocolate-covered crickets, curry crickets and a cricket crunch bar. Desjardins added Dubai and Madagascar cockroaches and live mealworms to the fun. What resulted sounded a bit like a wine-tasting affair gone mad.
"Nutty," said 36-year-old Elizabeth Davis, as she chewed a handful of live mealworms. "They pop a little bit in your mouth."
"Doesn't taste like bugs at all," said Donovan Thibodeau, a 10-year-old who was nibbling on chocolate-covered crickets. "It just tastes good."
When faced with the notion of eating bugs, Davis' 6-year-old daughter, Piper, made the classic scrunchy face of distaste. No way she was going to eat a bug, she declared. Then, 10 minutes later, she was munching on a handful of mealworms, the anticipated revulsion gone forever.
"That's not so bad," she said, and then she was at the table again, rounding up other bugs to eat as if they were candy samples.
It's a scene that repeated itself over and over while kids and adults alike had their first taste of critters normally avoided. Nobody spit their bugs back into a napkin. Nobody threw up. Nobody cried.
"I've been feeding bug cookies to kids for 10 years," Desjardins said, "and never had a problem."
Go figure. Insects aren't just as healthy as anything you will put in your mouth, the fact that they're taxonomically distant from us means there is very little chance that they will transmit disease. When you eat insects that are raised to be eaten, you're also not ingesting pesticides, herbicides or growth hormones, advocates said.
"Like any other labeling on food, it (bugs) would have standards set in place by the USDA," Desjardins said, referring to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. "I know the cricket vendors I deal with do not use any chemicals that would pass on to the animals. As far as growth hormone, I do not think it would be economical for the relatively short life of a bug."
Like others who farm insects, Desjardins knows exactly what he's getting when he eats one of his bugs. They're raised on grains and grasses, mainly, so there's never a question about what he's putting into his mouth.
The gains are tremendous. According to bugsfordinner.com, "crickets have as much protein as beef, as little fat as salmon and use less than 1 percent of the water needed to produce meat. In fact, edible insects can provide protein with all of the amino acids humans need, they have more calcium than milk, more iron than spinach and are packed with omega 3s and B12. They are also a prebiotic. In fact, everything about them looks great on paper."
And it's not like the idea is just now catching on; it's estimated that 2 billion people around the world are already making meals out of insects. In fact, in some poorer areas, if you're not eating bugs, you're probably starving.
"They're not doing it for fun," says Broadbent, "they're doing it for dinner."
Into the mouths of babes
So, why aren't we all eating bugs? The main thing, advocates say, is the stigma attached to the very idea of it. Bugs are multi-legged things, the stuff of horror movies and double-dog-dares. By and large, we're taught as very young children that bugs are icky things that should be squashed and forgotten.
But Elizabeth Davis' son Benjamin is not old enough to have developed these preconceptions. At 6-months-old, Benjamin only knows that if it tastes like food, he might as well eat it, as witnessed by the fact that he eagerly gummed a mealworm offered by his mother.
"He actually whined for more," Elizabeth said.
For Broadbent, these are all positive steps. With the era of commercially available edible bugs in its infancy, convincing the next generation of the benefits is of high importance to sellers and those concerned about the future.
"I mean, look at these guys," he said, as the kids continued to hungrily swarm his table. "They're eating bugs, and now it's in their heads that they CAN eat bugs.
It's amazing what could happen in the next few years."
It's not just about choice. According to the Finnish company EntoCube, it's also about sustainability.
"With the Earth's population estimated to reach 9 billion by 2050, there is an urgent need for new sustainable sources for food," according to the EntoCube website. "While resources like arable land and fresh water are growing increasingly scarce, there is an urgent need for more efficient food sources to be discovered and exploited.
"Current animal protein production has numerous devastating impacts," the site continues. "In Central America alone, 40 percent of deforestation is caused by cattle farming. It takes 20,000 liters of water to produce one kilogram of California beef. Also meat production uses eight times more fossil fuel energy to produce the same amount of protein as opposed to that of grains."
On the other hand, thousands and thousands of pounds of crickets can be grown on a single acre of land. Which is yet another reason why Broadbent is confident when he tells the kids: "Insects will be a part of your future."
Nom, nom, nom
Desjardins, who is an educator, author and animal rehabilitator, started out producing insects to feed his lizards and various other creatures - critters he presents all over the place to educate the masses. He's always recognized the value of insects, he said, and would encourage others to try them.
"When I first started doing it," Desjardins said, "it was all about the shock factor, seeing people's reactions and all of that. But after studying and doing the research, I found out that this is really a good thing."
Now that he promotes the many virtues of bug eating, he sees a lot of different reactions. Some dive right in and will eat all the bugs you can feed them. Some won't eat them at all, while others fall in the gray area: There are those, for instance, who will gladly eat a tray full of mealworm cookies, but balk at eating them live.
Fair enough. The idea is to get people beyond the old notion that bugs are for swatting and nothing else. The ick factor needs to go away, Desjardins says, so that entomophagy -- yup, there's a word for it -- can rise beyond the level of playground dares.
"It's such a simple solution for the problem of starvation and nutritional deprivation," Desjardins says. "Right now it's a fad. It's a new trend. In generations to come, it will be the norm."
Do you absolutely, positively have to look at the bug or bug parts before eating them? Not necessarily. There's cricket flour, for instance, which is made of dried, milled crickets. Make cookies, muffins or energy bars out of that and you'll get all the great protein, vitamins and minerals without the sight of, say, a mealworm nut cluster.
Because while the kids at the January presentation seemed to have little problem getting past it, there are plenty of grown-ups who aren't quite there yet. (See sidebar.)
Desjardins, who provided the cookies and nut clusters for a Sun Journal taste test, had advice for the squeamish: Get over it. Bugs are the future, and the sooner people come to grips with it, the sooner we can modify our eating habits.
"It's just a matter of looking past the bug parts," he said, "and saying, 'You know what? Pound for pound, this just makes a lot of sense.'"

Abstract: I think that Al Cowperthwaite, director of North Maine Woods and an active Aroostook outdoorsman, would share my sentiments. In fact, he and his ice fishing compadres have taken the side benefits of ice fishing to a whole new level with an on-the-ice culinary lash up he calls Chamberlain Chowder. Here, in Al's words, is how he prepares and assembles this belly-warming, soul- satisfying concoction: Sometime mid-morning we put a large kettle on the fire and begin the process of creating a batch of "Chamberlain Chowder." The basic ingredient is anything that comes through the ice in the morning hours- cusk make a great ingredient or brook trout or togue or whitefish.

Full text:   Although I don't ice fish any more (hard to find safe ice in the Florida Keys), I was once a die-hard ice fisherman and I have seen it all: the good, the bad, and the ugly. The good days on the ice were almost always in mid-March when the afternoon sun warmed things up, the fish were active and the fishing holes remained free of ice.
Although the worst day on the ice was better than the best day at the office, there were some days that were unremarkable: bitter cold with a north wind; ice fishing holes and tip ups that refreeze minutes after being chipped out, ungloved fingers numbed while rebaiting hooks.
Looking back, I can recall just one truly ugly ice-fishing trip.
It was at Seboeis Lake in late February. There was a February thaw at work and, after a good fishing day, we were headed down the lake at dusk on our way back to camp.
Slush fields!
Hidden beneath a surface crust of snow on the ice were pockets of water. Our snowmobiles, complete with hauled tote sleds, broke through the crust. We gunned the machines trying to break free and get back up on the surface crust. No joy! Soon the snowmobiles and the slush covered tote sleds were mired and not moving.
Ever happen to you? In time, we managed, with a team effort, to liberate our sleds and our exhausted water-soaked bodies from that slush field hell.
Later that evening, back at camp, with a warming fire and a steaming bowl of scallop stew, we were reminded that the best part of ice fishing is what comes after: the toddy, the food and the warm camp.
I think that Al Cowperthwaite, director of North Maine Woods and an active Aroostook outdoorsman, would share my sentiments. In fact, he and his ice fishing compadres have taken the side benefits of ice fishing to a whole new level with an on-the-ice culinary lash up he calls Chamberlain Chowder. Here, in Al's words, is how he prepares and assembles this belly-warming, soul- satisfying concoction:
Sometime mid-morning we put a large kettle on the fire and begin the process of creating a batch of "Chamberlain Chowder." The basic ingredient is anything that comes through the ice in the morning hours- cusk make a great ingredient or brook trout or togue or whitefish.
The first thing that goes into the pot is a pound of bacon which has been cut into spoon sized chunks. Once the bacon is about done, throw in two large chopped onions, then about 2 quarts of water, a pound of potatoes diced. Add a half pound of real butter, 2 tablespoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper, 2 sliced garlic cloves.
While this simmers until the potatoes are soft, we fillet the fresh-caught fish and set them aside until the potatoes are ready, then add the fish, scallops, shrimp, lobster and, if the fresh fish happen to be scarce, we substitute by adding some haddock. Then cook until the fish is done but not so long that all the fish fall apart.
Just before the mixture starts to boil, add a half cup of cooking sherry and a half gallon of half and half. We bring the temperature back to just before boiling and serve with some oyster crackers. Feeds about 10-12 fellows and if there are any leftovers they never go to waste.

Eastern Star chapter has three centenarians

Abstract: "When we gather or go to other meetings within the state, it is to see our friends, support them and support our charities," [Cathy Wood] said. "It is a social event, one I truly enjoy. If I didn't have Eastern Star, I wouldn't have a reason to leave my house. This is how I socialize, how I get out and see my friends -- lasting friends that I have made in the many years I have been a member of Eastern Star." Of the three centenarians, [Betty Weston] might have been the most active member. Weston still lives at home on her family's farm in Fryeburg, and she was the Pythagorean Chapter's chaplain for more than 25 years until she retired from that position sometime near 2008. She held the chapter's highest position, worthy matron, in 1952. Prior to that, she held several progressive stations in the chapter, including Adah, Ruth, Martha, warder, marshall, associate conductress, conductress and associate matron. "Our charities extend from our local towns to the Masonic Children's Dyslexia Learning Centers in Portland and Bangor," Wood said. "These are centers where children with reading difficulties can go, free of charge, for an hour each day, twice a week, for tutoring. The tutors at these centers received specialized training to instruct these students. We support the Shriners Children Hospitals, Heart, Alzheimer's, Wounded Warriors, purchase wreaths for the veterans' cemeteries, and these are just a small part of our charities."

Full text:   EDITOR'S NOTE: Betty Walker died Thursday, after the following story had been written.
FRYEBURG -- If the ages of three of its members are any indication, the Order of the Eastern Star Pythagorean Chapter 169 of Fryeburg may just hold the secret to longevity.
When member Betty Walker was born 107 years ago, Ford was just introducing the Model T, and life as the world knew it was rapidly changing. In her lifetime, Walker has experienced two world wars, the Great Depression, the Korean War, the Civil Rights Movement, the first rocket to outer space, Vietnam, the first moon walk, the Kennedy Assassination, Watergate, the fall of the Berlin Wall and countless other major historically significant events.
Inventions in her lifetime include items most modern households wouldn't know what to do without, like the pop-up toaster, Band-aids, aerosol cans, cake mix, canned beer, diet soda, credit cards, microwaves, televisions, computers, mobile phones and other things, from crayons to penicillin and even the atomic bomb.
What's even more impressive is that the Pythagorean Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star boasts two other centenarian members who, like Walker, must have some stories to tell about what has gone on in the world over the past 100 years or so. They are 103-year-old Mary Josephine Cressy and 104-year-old Betty Weston.
"The Order of the Eastern Star is an organization that brings fellowship and friends together," Pythagorean Chapter Worthy Matron Cathy Wood said. "We make many lasting friendships across our state, the United States and worldwide. We are the largest fraternal organization for men and women in the world."
According to the organization's paperwork, there are over 2 million members of the Order of the Eastern Star throughout the world. Approximately 7,000 of those members belong to chapters in Maine. When Walker, Cressy and Weston were first active members, Wood said the Pythagorean Chapter was about 150 members strong. That number has since dwindled to 68 members, but Wood said the social and charitable aspects of the organization keep her and many others returning for years and years, if not for the rest of their lives.
"When we gather or go to other meetings within the state, it is to see our friends, support them and support our charities," Wood said. "It is a social event, one I truly enjoy. If I didn't have Eastern Star, I wouldn't have a reason to leave my house. This is how I socialize, how I get out and see my friends -- lasting friends that I have made in the many years I have been a member of Eastern Star."
Of the three centenarians, Weston might have been the most active member. Weston still lives at home on her family's farm in Fryeburg, and she was the Pythagorean Chapter's chaplain for more than 25 years until she retired from that position sometime near 2008. She held the chapter's highest position, worthy matron, in 1952. Prior to that, she held several progressive stations in the chapter, including Adah, Ruth, Martha, warder, marshall, associate conductress, conductress and associate matron.
Wood said records indicate that while Weston was worthy matron, she organized an Easter dance with Eastern Star members and Masons. While the Order of the Eastern Star is not officially part of the Masonic fraternity, membership is based on a Masonic affiliation or relationship. Male members of the Order of the Eastern Star must be Masons who are in good standing and female members must be affiliated with a Mason in good standing. There are specific affiliation requirements outlined in chapter bylaws.
Weston also held suppers before meetings, serving foods such as oyster stew. Under her leadership, the chapter made donations to Shriners Hospitals and Eastern Star Training Awards for Religious Leadership. Wood said supporting charities is a large part of what the Eastern Star organization is all about.
"Our charities extend from our local towns to the Masonic Children's Dyslexia Learning Centers in Portland and Bangor," Wood said. "These are centers where children with reading difficulties can go, free of charge, for an hour each day, twice a week, for tutoring. The tutors at these centers received specialized training to instruct these students. We support the Shriners Children Hospitals, Heart, Alzheimer's, Wounded Warriors, purchase wreaths for the veterans' cemeteries, and these are just a small part of our charities."
Their charitable nature also turns inward, supporting their own members who might have special physical, emotional or financial needs. When Weston was worthy matron, for instance, she sent flowers to older, shut-in members.
Cressy was worthy matron in 1958 after holding five stations over previous years leading up to that honor, including Ruth, Esther, associate conductress, conductress and associate matron. Cressy, who now resides at the Bridgton Health Care Center, especially enjoyed the social aspects of being an Eastern Star member. She liked to decorate the dining hall for Christmas meetings, Wood said.
Cressy owned a five-and-dime in Fryeburg, but worked so much, she rarely had time to socialize outside of the store. She was looking for something engaging that would help her meet and mingle with her peers in the community.
"I guess because it was the thing to do," Cressy said of why she chose to join Eastern Star.
Cressy, to this day, is active and athletic. She said it's part of what helped her live such a long life. In her earlier years, she used to enjoy teaching swimming in the Saco River, and she always loved skiing. For her 103rd birthday, she went cross-country skiing at Pineland Farm in New Gloucester, and for her 104th birthday, she said she hopes to spend some time in indoor swimming pool.
Walker resided at the Fryeburg Health Care Center and held one position in Eastern Star: Esther in 1949. After that she lent her time and support as a "sideliner," or non-officer member, Wood said.
There are 18 officers in the chapter. Fifty-year members receive the honored designation. Once a member reaches the age of 80, if they have not been a member for 50 years, they receive a lifetime member status. Each of the centenarian women holds one of those official ranks.
The Pythagorean Chapter of the Order of Eastern Star meets at the Fryeburg Masonic Hall on the first Thursday of the month, from March to September and November and December; and the second Thursday in October.

Full text:   SCARBOROUGH -- Three friends and business partners have set their sights on opening the town's first brewery, Nonesuch River Brewing, late next year.
Alex Acquisto/Sun Media Wire
Renovations for Nonesuch River Brewing in Scarborough are slated to begin this spring.
Vetted and approved by the Planning Board for a first reading on Monday, Tim Boardman, Michael Schuler and Jay Gambo plan to build the brew pub at 201 Gorham Road, barring final approval from the board in February.
The parcel is occupied by a dilapidated and uninhabited house, but once they close on the property, the trio hopes to have the lot cleared before the first major snowfall.
"I'm so glad you're coming to Scarborough," Planning Board member Susan Auglis told them Monday.
The three friends have designed a building inspired by historic New England barn architecture, complete with a tin roof, a spacious front facade and red siding. Boardman, who owns Boardman Builders, plans to build the 5,000-square-foot structure on the 2[1/2]-acre parcel bordered by woodlands. Included will be an indoor mezzanine, a balcony and about 140 seats, 30 of which will be outdoors.
"I believe Scarborough is so underserved with good food and a good place for the community to gather," Schuler said Tuesday.
Last winter, Boardman and Schuler, who has been brewing his own beer for about 12 years, were at a hockey tournament out of town. Schuler brought a few bottles for fellow parents, and the quality of it caught the attention of Boardman, who used to brew for Casco Bay Brewing.
"It was very, very good," Boardman recalled. They got to talking about how Scarborough needs a brew pub, and then Gambo entered the picture after he moved back with his family from San Francisco, where he owned and operated two restaurants as head chef.
They decided to combine their talents and to build an on-site brewery, bar and restaurant.
The Scarborough food and beer scene is barren compared with neighboring Portland, Gambo said Tuesday. Even as a former resident of San Francisco, Gambo said he looked at Scarborough -- with its more rural feel and abundance of fresh, farm-food options -- and thought it would be the perfect place for a farm-to-table restaurant.
"And add handcrafted beer -- that's just perfect," Gambo said.
Gambo plans to offer as many local and seasonal menu items as possible, buying from local farms and businesses such as Broadturn Farm, Frith Farm and Nonesuch Oysters.
The trio shies away from referring to the food they want to offer as "pub food," because that implies fried and greasy, Gambo said. Nonesuch River Brewing will boast more refined yet still accessible pub options, such as handmade pasta and fresh salads.
Brunch will be offered on weekends, Gambo said. And while the selection will be refined, the menu will include plenty of options for those who want a Portland-quality meal, as well as families on their way home from soccer practice who want to feed their kids, Gambo said.
Schuler plans to offer an array of taps that pump beer made in-house. Options will include an India pale ale, a red ale, a blond ale and a Hefeweizen. But those options aren't fixed, Schuler said; he wants to cater to residents' thirst.
"It will be a very nimble approach to brewing - if the town has a thirst for a whiskey porter, we can brew that," he said. "I'm not an ego-driven brewer; I want to make the masses happy with what we're providing."

Eats: Soiree of fantastic, farm-fresh food

Abstract: "I'm the new guy," [Christopher Chekouras] laughingly said, noting he was impressed by what he'd observed in his four weeks on the job, including how far "the hospital's outreach goes beyond the doors of the hospital." Following these remarks, Chef Leslie Oster from Aurora Provisions in Portland and Abigail Carroll from Nonesuch Oysters in Scarborough got to work cooking up some "Maine oysters Rockefeller." The cooking demonstration was broadcast live in all the rooms of the center, as well as outside for those who weren't able to get seats in the kitchen. Oster and Carroll made it look easy and do-able from a home kitchen and samples were passed to guests. Oster's final cooking demonstration was beet ravioli with goat cheese. Using Emery Farm beets that had been roasted in the Fireworks mobile oven, she mixed them into a paste with Sunset Acres Farm and Dairy goat cheese (all the way from Brooksville). Seasoned with herbs, salt and pepper and held together by an egg, this mixture was scooped into wonton wrappers and quick boiled in small batches. The rich flavor of the goat cheese was smoothed out by the earthy flavor of the beets and served with a side of ... raw Brussels sprout salad.

Full text:   The Brussels sprout ... it's a leafy green vegetable that grows on a space alien-like stalk and looks like a tiny cabbage.
It's so cute!
You want to love it, but every time you bring it home and prepare it you're disappointed. Steam it, saute it, broil it, bake it. Cover it with dressings and sauces, combine it with other trendy vegetables and it still leaves a bitter taste in your mouth.
Often forgotten in our quest to prepare and enjoy new and novel foods is that access to such things as fresh Brussels sprouts is not an option for some men, women and children in our communities. Thanks to the passion of employees and volunteers at the St. Mary's Nutrition Center, food options are changing and increasing for everyone in our community.
The Nutrition Center's simple belief -- good food for everyone -- has resulted in a number of initiatives over the years, including urban community gardens, hands-on cooking and nutrition programs for all ages, and the sponsorship of a year-round farmers' market in Lewiston. More fresh local food now finds its way into more urban homes. To sustain the work of these important projects, the Nutrition Center hosts an annual "Soiree."
On Friday night, Oct. 30, it was standing room only at St. Mary's Nutrition Center on Bates Street in Lewiston for the organization's 10th anniversary Soiree. All available tickets sold out and a long list of business and personal sponsor/donors filled the event guide. There were plenty of volunteers to help in every capacity, and most of them were veterans of the event. The social hour started promptly at 5:30 p.m. with wine from The Vault and hard ciders from Ricker Hill Orchards.
Double Z Land & Livestock's Chris, Kate and Teo Abbruzzese -- with a little help from Samantha Sawyer -- set up their "Fireworks" wood-fired pizza oven near the rear entrance of the building, and the smell of roasting beets and grass-fed beef short ribs filled the cool night air.
The Good Food Bus rolled into the parking lot about a half-hour into the event and bus coordinator Annie Doran gave tours and explained how the "farmers market that shows up at your door" will be serving L/A and beyond.
Promptly at 6:30 p.m., emcee Jim Pross introduced St. Mary's new CEO Christopher Chekouras.
"I'm the new guy," Chekouras laughingly said, noting he was impressed by what he'd observed in his four weeks on the job, including how far "the hospital's outreach goes beyond the doors of the hospital."
Nutrition Center Director Kirsten Walter welcomed the guests and also honored Joyce Gagnon, who retired this year after serving as food pantry manager for 25 years.
Gagnon, interviewed during the social hour, recollected one of her first memories of running the food pantry. She said a man came in to get food to make his son a birthday meal. Gagnon recalled how she had helped this father select food for the meal and had bagged the things up for him. His appreciation of the pantry's help was just one of many events which she said "fueled my passion for the work of the food pantry all these years."
Following these remarks, Chef Leslie Oster from Aurora Provisions in Portland and Abigail Carroll from Nonesuch Oysters in Scarborough got to work cooking up some "Maine oysters Rockefeller." The cooking demonstration was broadcast live in all the rooms of the center, as well as outside for those who weren't able to get seats in the kitchen. Oster and Carroll made it look easy and do-able from a home kitchen and samples were passed to guests.
Tasting a sample, Rob Westhoven of Auburn said the dish was "awesome." He said this was his fifth or sixth year attending the event and he started going because all of his three children were born at St. Mary's. "I love the people at the hospital."
He said he and his entire family also like to garden and cook and that's part of why he supports the event. When asked about his year-to-year experiences, Westhoven said "it's always a little different each year and I always get to try something new."
"Like the oysters" he said, finishing the last forkful.
Oster's second live cooking demonstration included the Double Z short ribs, cooked up into a chili with pumpkin and served with Bannock quick bread. More warm and cozy happiness in a dish was served and enjoyed all around.
Oster's final cooking demonstration was beet ravioli with goat cheese. Using Emery Farm beets that had been roasted in the Fireworks mobile oven, she mixed them into a paste with Sunset Acres Farm and Dairy goat cheese (all the way from Brooksville). Seasoned with herbs, salt and pepper and held together by an egg, this mixture was scooped into wonton wrappers and quick boiled in small batches. The rich flavor of the goat cheese was smoothed out by the earthy flavor of the beets and served with a side of ... raw Brussels sprout salad.
A few glances around the room convinced this writer that everyone was having the same unbelievable response to the tiny cabbage salad. Freaking awesome!
Happy and full of fresh, local food, guests mingled over coffee and brown paper cones filled with mini-apple doughnuts drizzled with honey. It was a perfect and sweet ending to a lovely soiree, capping off 10 years of helping bring good food to all.

Full text:   SCARBOROUGH -- Abigail Carroll would never have guessed that as a former trader in the Paris stock market, she would eventually start her own oyster farm in the waters off southern Maine.
Alex Acquisto/The Forecaster
Abigail Carroll, owner of Nonesuch Oysters in Scarborough, shows bags of oysters underneath a portion of the dock at the Pine Point Fisherman's Co-op. Carroll started her oyster farm in 2010.
Alex Acquisto/The Forecaster
Abigail Carroll holds two free-range Crassostrea virginica oysters that have different appearances, highlighting the nuance of environmental influences on the growing cycle of oysters.
After ending a relationship, leaving France and moving back to Maine for the summer, one of Carroll's friends wanted to start an oyster farm and Carroll agreed to help, not knowing she would adopt the career herself.
"It was really quite accidental," Carroll, a Portland native living in Biddeford, said Tuesday morning as she meandered her small motor skiff around moored lobster boats toward her lines of oyster bags.
Now in her fifth year of operation, Carroll and her small team of mostly volunteers for Nonesuch Oysters farm the mollusks in the brackish waters near the Pine Point Fisherman's Co-op, where the incoming ocean tide meets freshwater from the Scarborough River.
The entire growth process is free-range and, while the farm is still in its nascent stages, Carroll said she's "really excited; I think we found the solution to use less gear and let nature work its course."
More than two years ago, Carroll applied to the Department of Marine Resources for permission to expand her site. A public hearing was held earlier this month, and she expects to receive the permit in the near future.
Nonesuch Oysters are farmed in an area totaling about 4 1/2 acres near the west side of the river. If an expansion is permitted, Nonesuch would have access to about seven acres along the western shore. In that additional acreage, Carroll would be able to do more ground seeding in deeper waters.
The goal, she said, is to have several long lines of oyster bags, rather than the shorter, fragmented lines, which she now uses.
Carroll cultivates American Crassostrea virginica oysters and European Ostrea edulis oysters.
Most oyster farms in Maine harvest virginicas, Carroll said as she pulled two out of a submerged bag and held them in her hands; but remarkably, they can look and taste very differently, depending on the habitat.
Carroll uses the French word "terroir" to describe the direct relationship between how the environment affects the character of the item being cultivated. The term is used most often to describe the nuanced environmental distinctions between wine grapes, but it's perfectly applicable to oysters, too, she said.
"An oyster is absolutely a product of its environment," Carroll said, holding two oysters very different in appearance: one was smaller and white, and the other, larger and green. Both are virginicas, she said, but one had been pulled from a buoyant bag and the other from the ocean floor, a couple feet deeper.
Carroll likes to start her oysters in bags, where they spend the first years of their lives.
Near the end of their growing process, Carroll drops those oysters a couple feet lower, to the ocean floor. This exposes them to different environmental influences, and ultimately creates a blend of taste and appearance that varies from oyster to oyster, making them "more beautiful and robust," she said.
During tours she gives on her boat during the warmer months, Carroll asks her customers what they think the terroir is in a specific area.
"We're so close to the mouth of the ocean, you've got a lot of saltwater at high tide," she said. At low tide, the volume of freshwater and saltwater shifts and the oysters are exposed to different vegetation with the reverse flow of water, like decomposing sea grass and increased levels of sediment.
"I've had people tell me my oysters are the sweetest they've ever had, and I've had others tell me my oysters are the briniest they've ever had," Carroll said.
"What I've learned about marine watershed ecology is that oysters are this amazing example of how susceptible marine creatures are to even a small change in their environments," she said. "That just shows you how important this idea of terroir is to this industry."
The role of oyster farmer is different than a land farmer, in that Carroll doesn't directly feed the product she's cultivating.
"We just want to create the water flow," she said, so the oysters are able to ingest the water and plankton. "Nature works really well when you let it."
Typically, oysters are harvested when they get to be between 2 1/2 and 3 inches in diameter. Oysters grown in Maine tend to grow about an inch a year, Carroll said, "but I think we can do better than that."
The best harvest year since Nonesuch was founded in 2010 yielded about 100,000 oysters, Carroll said.
Consumers can find Nonesuch oysters in several Portland locations, including Eventide Oyster Co., Fore Street, Petite Jacqueline and Harbor Fish Market. Other southern Maine locations including Bayley's Seafood and Ken's Place in Scarborough, and Earth in Kennebunk.
Nonesuch also sells to Clio's Restaurant and B&G Oysters in Boston, and Grand Central Oyster Bar and Restaurant in New York City.
Carroll and her team didn't cultivate any oysters this summer. Instead, they just conducted research that will eventually fill a handbook.
"We're just setting up for the future," she said.
They began harvesting in mid-September and will continue until the waters become impassable due to winter ice.
In a 2013 TEDxYouth talk that Carroll gave in Biddeford, she said, "I never wanted to be an oyster lady, and I never thought I'd come back to Maine. But it's ironic: by becoming an oyster lady, I've found a renewed sense of purpose."

This is the opening line of Andrew Zimmern's new series, "Big Country." "I encourage them to have their own opinion," [Michael Roy] said. "I believe in natural consequences." "I was definitely amazed to find out New Orleans is a lot like Lewiston in a sense. There's a lot of poverty. Except for the balconies and the rustic buildings.

"I was definitely amazed to find out New Orleans is a lot like Lewiston in a sense."
-- Michael Roy
Michael Roy, left, takes a selfie in New Orleans with Andrew Zimmern.
Andrew Zimmern is a well-known and celebrated chef, writer, teacher and television personality. He is most well recognized for his show, "Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern," on the Travel Channel.
With the help of U.S. Cellular and the Travel Channel, five deserving people across the U.S. were chosen to go on an all-expenses paid trip with Zimmern to different cities across the country. The only requirement to be chosen: never flying on a plane before, and being a U.S. Cellular costumer.
Michael Roy, a single dad from Lewiston, was the last person selected for this once-in-a-lifetime experience. With the help of his sons, Aidan, 11, and Dacyn, 9, Roy submitted a 350-word essay about why he deserved to win. It explained how important he is to his kids and to the community.
Roy said he has a lot of experience helping people; it's his real passion in life.
He works for Prebble Street Veteran Housing Services as a case manager. He helps veterans find housing, employment and support. He is also pursuing a degree in mental health and human services, which he wants to link with his addiction counseling certification to open his own practice. He wants to be able to help people dealing with low incomes and addiction for an affordable price.
Before helping veterans, he worked for New Beginnings, a homeless youth center in Lewiston. He dedicated so much of his time and energy to helping other people, that his sons believe it was time for him to get something back.
When he isn't been helping other people in the Lewiston-Auburn area, Roy is taking care of his kids, making sure they are provided for a looked after. He said they especially like to eat meals together and go to pirate festivals.
"I try to be a good dad," Roy said. "We have a lot of fun, we are a family."
Roy said one of the most important things he focuses on is separating work from home.
"I encourage them to have their own opinion," Roy said. "I believe in natural consequences."
He said his kids are his biggest support, both in this experience and every day.
"They were the ones who pushed me to do this. I wouldn't have been able to do any of it without them," he said.
According to Roy, the fifth round of submissions was by far the largest pool. The first four rounds had only 50-100 submissions, but his had about 2,600. When it came down to picking a winner, there were four or five finalists. Roy was told to have video clips ready, to test how he acted on camera. Just a few days later, he was notified that he would go on the last leg.
The trip itself was quick and exciting, Roy said. He left from Portland International Jetport on a hot July Tuesday and flew back that Thursday. Wednesday was a 13-hour day of filming, eating different foods and traveling on the Mississippi River.
The most nerve-wracking part of the trip was the first plane ride, he said. It was his first time flying, and he switched seats so he could have the aisle seat.
"I know if I look out the window, I'll just freak out," he said. By the end of the trip, though, he was feeling a little more confident. "I felt adventurous. I even looked out the window a few times!" he said, laughing.
Roy said he is thankful for that push to finally fly, though. He said not being able to held him back in his professional and everyday life.
"Getting on a plane has finally opened so many opportunities for me," he said.
Roy explained that his favorite part of the trip was "the horse-and-carriage ride. The stories (the tour guide) was telling us about the ghosts and stuff, that was really cool."
He said he though that his favorite part of the experience was the people.
"The crew that I hung with...they were amazing. Andrew was amazing. Everyone just treated me really well. That was my favorite part," Roy said.
When asked what it was like to spend time with Zimmern, Roy's face lit up.
"He's such a cool guy, so down to Earth, smart, funny. He's really cool. And also calm under pressure." Roy said that throughout the whole day of filming, fans kept coming up asking for autographs and pictures and Zimmern never got flustered or upset, even through 13 hours of filming in 90 degree weather with 100 percent humidity.
One of the most memorable parts of the day was the food, Roy said. He isn't a big fan of seafood, which made eating a gourmet seafood meal interesting. But he said the food was amazing, anyway. His favorite? The stuffed oysters.
John Besh, the chef, introduced him to a whole new array of food and culture of eating. Zimmern and Roy took a behind-the-scenes look at Besh's New Orleans seafood based restaurant, trying almost everything on the menu.
The thing Roy said he was most curious about was the difference in culture, especially from the point of view of someone who had never been outside of New England.
"I was definitely amazed to find out New Orleans is a lot like Lewiston in a sense. There's a lot of poverty. Except for the balconies and the rustic buildings. But when you look at the people, they're really struggling." he said. "As far as culture shock, though, I almost felt right at home. Except for the palm trees and the heat."
At the end of the trip, Zimmern, with the help of U.S. Cellular, offered a stipend for Roy and his sons to come back to New Orleans next year. Roy is hoping to go in the fall, to avoid the boisterous heat.
Roy said seeing himself on TV made it feel even more real. "Sharing the screen with a big star like Andrew Zimmern, it just felt incredible."
When asked why he hasn't travelled before, he said, "I don't make a whole lot of money. I don't have a lot of free time."
Roy also said that Zimmern is paying for him to go to the Veteran's Convention in New York in May. Roy began to tear up a little, getting emotional from all of the support he received from his family and from Zimmern.
"Talk about a humbling experience. At the end of our footage, I had tears coming down. It was such an emotional day," he said. "It means a lot, because I'm so used to giving everything of myself to everybody. I don't take time for myself. Between the kids and school and my work, there's just not enough time in the day for myself.
"If, I don't earn it, I don't want it." he said.
One of the U.S. Cellular representatives of the trip with him told him, "You gotta find time to allow people to give you stuff, because you give everyone so much."
Roy said that hit him really close to home and allowed him to fully accept all of the support and gifts from the trip and from all of the companies involved.
"Big Country" was made possible by the Travel Channel, Andrew Zimmern, U.S. Cellular and Crazy Legs Productions.

Abstract: The goal is to get to Winged Foot, the fabled Mamaroneck, N.Y., golf course. The road to Winged Foot goes through Portsmouth, R.I., tomorrow in the U.S. Golf Association's 4-Ball Qualifying event at the Carnegie Abbey Club. Winged Foot is the site of the 2016 USGA 4-Ball Championship next spring. To qualify for the 4-Ball Championship at Winged Foot May 19-25 would be a tremendous accomplishment, not to mention the honor of playing at a golf course which was the site of the U.S. Open in 1929, 1959, 1974, 1984 and 2006. Plus, Winged Foot is scheduled to host the Open in 2020. Located in an affluent Westchester County community, north of New York City, Winged Foot also has been the site of the U.S. Women's Open, the U.S. Amateur, the U.S. Senior Amateur and the 1997 PGA. Winged Foot is a 36-hole course, designed by the renowned architect A. W. Tillinghast. All of which tells you that Winged Foot oozes with golf history.

The road to Winged Foot goes through Portsmouth, R.I., tomorrow in the U.S. Golf Association's 4-Ball Qualifying event at the Carnegie Abbey Club. Winged Foot is the site of the 2016 USGA 4-Ball Championship next spring.
Bill Kennedy
Among the four Maine teams entered are the duos of Andrew Slattery and Matt Greenleaf, and Craig Chapman and Curt Jordan. It is a second attempt to qualify for Chapman and Jordan who once were Edward Little High School golf teammates. So if experience playing together is a factor in 4-ball competition, Chapman and Jordan have it on their side.
They play together at Fox Ridge, Martindale and The Woodlands, and Chapman has the advantage of having played Carnegie Abbey while he was on his college golf team at Bryant. Plus, both have been in the Tri-States competition between Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
If Slattery, who lives in Minot and is a Martindale member, and Greenleaf, a member at Sable Oaks, qualify, it could be attributable to the success Slattery has had the past two years. He was amateur champion of the Maine State Golf Association in 2014 and this year captured the Maine State Match Play title.
"I was also on the USGA State Team," said Slattery, a senior at the University of Southern Maine, "and I got a little taste for this."
In order to get to know Carnegie Abbey a little better, all four are in Rhode Island today playing a practice round at the course.
"Most of us are going down there the day before," said Slattery last week about the eight Mainers in the qualifier.
To qualify for the 4-Ball Championship at Winged Foot May 19-25 would be a tremendous accomplishment, not to mention the honor of playing at a golf course which was the site of the U.S. Open in 1929, 1959, 1974, 1984 and 2006. Plus, Winged Foot is scheduled to host the Open in 2020. Located in an affluent Westchester County community, north of New York City, Winged Foot also has been the site of the U.S. Women's Open, the U.S. Amateur, the U.S. Senior Amateur and the 1997 PGA. Winged Foot is a 36-hole course, designed by the renowned architect A. W. Tillinghast. All of which tells you that Winged Foot oozes with golf history.

Abstract: Getting the DMR to recognize the areas as clean and conduct their surveys took a lot of "pushing," [Darcie Couture] said. He told selectmen the committee had to consistently "nag" the DMR to get the surveys done and reclassify the areas. Hiring Couture as its marine consultant in 2014 gave them "a lot of extra ammo," he said. The reopening of the areas is "one of the most significant changes in marine resources in Harpswell," she said, because "there's just not a whole lot of clams left these days."

Full text:   HARPSWELL -- Five coves that were closed to shellfish harvesting for more than a decade reopened July 30.
The Maine Department of Marine Resources had previously prohibited harvesting at Dog's Head Cove, Gun Point Cove, Indian Rest, Oakhurst Island and Ridley Cove, and Quahog Bay.
Darcie Couture, the town's marine resource coordinator, told the Board of Selectmen Aug. 20 that the areas were closed for two reasons.
Some had been shut down due to pollution issues, she said, that have "since been remediated."
But others were closed because sanitary surveys the DMR is supposed to do every 12 years were out of date.
Getting the DMR to recognize the areas as clean and conduct their surveys took a lot of "pushing," Couture said.
David Wilson, head of the Marine Resources Committee, echoed Couture on Tuesday.
He told selectmen the committee had to consistently "nag" the DMR to get the surveys done and reclassify the areas. Hiring Couture as its marine consultant in 2014 gave them "a lot of extra ammo," he said.
The areas, which are mapped on the town website, are open to commercial harvest of soft-shell clams Thursday, Fridays, and Saturdays.
The committee limited the harvest to three days to avoid a "gold-rush mentality" and immediately deplete the resource, Couture said.
The reopening of the areas is "one of the most significant changes in marine resources in Harpswell," she said, because "there's just not a whole lot of clams left these days."
Statewide, landings of soft-shell clams have declined from 40 million pounds in 1977 to just about 10 million pounds in 2014, according to data from the DMR.
Scientists and harvesters attribute the decimation to a number of environmental factors, including green crab predation, ocean acidification, and a disease called neoplasia. Competing pressure with blood worm harvesters on the mud flats has also stressed the resource, clammers say.
Even with new areas to harvest, making a living as a clammer in Harpswell is getting harder and harder.
At the end of Tuesday night's meeting, one clammer suggested they reach out to real estate mogul and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to join the Harpswell Marine Resources Committee.

Abstract: 5. "Invenium viam aut Facium" ("Find a way or make one") was arctic explorer Admiral Robert E. Peary's: "The lead paddlers are in amazing shape and can go fast for a long period of time," said [Thor Emory]. "Other people, they've been doing it long enough that they can just keep going. For a 12-mile race, anything from under 2 hours to 5.5 hours is kind of the spread." 2) A French-speaking kids' summer camp. The website for camp Tekakwitha (as run through Google translator) describes it as "a French holiday camp in Maine in the United States, nestled at the edge of a vast wilderness lake." It's even accredited by the Association of Quebec Camps.

Full text:   Maine is the place to find natural beauty, moose and a town claiming to be the "Center of the Known Universe."
Around here, we know how to toss back giant oysters, navigate Devil's Elbows and celebrate our "Chickens."
Yes, that's capital Chickens, in quotes, but actual chickens, too.
It's just how we roll.
The Sun Journal's third annual Who Knew??? Summer Road Trip Quiz is chock-full of Maine trivia and trivia-inspired trips itching to be had.
So go. Explore. Soak it in, and add to Maine's greatness.
1. Maine is the only place in the world to find:
1) The rare Jacquardian Moose, which exhibits a subtle floral pattern on its flanks at birth.
2) The original manuscript for "Uncle Tom's Cabin" by Harriet Beecher Stowe, in the Maine State Museum (on display once a year).
3) A three-day, 30-mile high-intensity stand-up paddleboarding race where you may or may not paddle your a . . . er, arms off.
2. Last September, the winner of the Maine State Oyster Eating Championships ate how many jumbo oysters in 15 minutes?
1) 234
2) 56
3) 152
3. Fifty-nine years after famously patenting the ear muff, what other invention did Chester Greenwood receive a patent for?
1) A metal rake with "a plurality of resilient metal teeth."
2) A roller skate with three wheels "aligned such as a triangle," for handling sharp curves.
3) A ghost detecting trap, "beaver-lined, costing less than 5 dollars."
4. What town in Maine has a neighborhood with the highest rate of occupied homes without indoor plumbing?
1) Lubec
2) York
3) Gray
5. "Invenium viam aut Facium" ("Find a way or make one") was arctic explorer Admiral Robert E. Peary's:
1) Personal motto.
2) Dog's name (called Veni for short).
3) Title of his unpublished autobiography, rejected by three different publishers when he refused to include the translation on the cover.
6. Strong is the former "Toothpick Capital of the World."
1) True.
2) False.
7. The University of Maine houses a collection of 7,796 hooked rugs donated by an alum.
1) True.
2) False.
8. The town of Leeds has . . .
1) A plaque at the town office remembering Mike and Oogie, two roosters who made it into Ripley's Believe It or Not for very unrooster-like antics.
2) A French-speaking kids' summer camp founded by Dominican friars from Lewiston in 1938.
3) More cows than people.
9. At the Maine Seaweed Festival later this month, you'll find:
1) A seaweed-inspired interpretive dance.
2) The debut of a new flavor of kelp ice cream.
3) The only place in the entire country having a seaweed festival.
10. This Maine town is, according to itself, the "Center of the Known Universe":
1) Bar Harbor
2) Bethel
3) Bucksport
ANSWERS
1. Maine is the only place in the world for?
3) The Lobster SUP CUP, a three-day, 30-mile paddleboard race over ocean and lakes. (SUP stands for stand-up paddleboarding, fyi.)
Now go: To Rockport, like, now! The third annual Lobster SUP CUP is running this weekend, Aug. 7-9. Organizer Thor Emory said Rockport Harbor is the best place to watch racers coming and going. He claims it's the only multi-day, distance race like it in the world, and hasn't had anyone dispute that claim yet.
That makes it good enough for us.
Last year, 68 people turned out from all over the country and Canada to paddle their buns off.
"The lead paddlers are in amazing shape and can go fast for a long period of time," said Emory. "Other people, they've been doing it long enough that they can just keep going. For a 12-mile race, anything from under 2 hours to 5.5 hours is kind of the spread."
2. How many oysters did the oyster champ eat?
3) 152! According to a story that originally appeared in the Castine Patriot, the winner, Josh "Chicken" Carter of Blue Hill, beat his closest competitor by 27 oysters. Josh, we salute you for intestinal fortitude and an incredible nickname.
Now go: To Castine! Because you have to see this spectacle for yourself.
Paul Brouillard, the owner of Dennett's Wharf restaurant, the event's host, said he'll hold the next championship this September.
Last year, he had more than 100 would-be contenders and narrowed the pack to 25, who scarfed away after a little shellfish-themed entertainment.
"We have a little parade ahead of it that's led by the transgender bivalves and a couple of same-sex clams and a couple bartenders in drag," said Brouillard.
Man. Sounds like a party.
3. Chester Greenwood's invention?
1) A metal rake, patent no. 2,066,036. Greenwood had many, many inventions in his lifetime, including a wood-boring machine in 1914 and a kettle in 1929, according to Martin Wallace, patents and trademarks librarian at the University of Maine's Fogler Library.
Now go: To Farmington! Lovely to visit any time of year, but mark your calendar for Dec. 5 and you can celebrate the annual Chester Greenwood Day. Watch the big parade. Wear ear muffs, of course. Rake something, ceremonially. Just generally live it up.
4. No flush for you?
3) Gray! According to the U.S. Census, the Gray CDP (census designated place, a small snapshot within the town) has 295 occupied housing units, 38 of which lack full indoor plumbing.
Now go: To Gray! Go for the outdoor loos, stay for the Maine Wildlife Park. Choose from regular weekend events (sing with Rick Charette, meet the cast of Animal Planet's "North Woods Law") or mingle with the animals. There are cougars, moose and bears who also, well, you know.
5. Admiral Peary and "Invenium viam aut Facium"?
1) His personal motto, according to the Friends of Perry's Eagle Island, the famous explorer's summer home 20 minutes off the coast of Harpswell.
Now go: How are those sea legs feeling? Sail yourself to Eagle Island or take one of several charters to check out his picturesque property and the home he built in 1904. In just the last year, the National Park Service designated it a national historic landmark. It's open in the summer from June 15 through Labor Day and features a free audio tour recorded by Peary's grandson. (State park fees apply.)
6. Was Strong the toothpick capital?
1) So true. According to a 2003 Associated Press story, the Forster plant once made 15.6 million toothpicks a day. For more on the tiny toothpick's big history, check out the American Enterprise Institute's "The Glorious Toothpick."
Now go: Feel like a road trip through some beautiful country? Cap off a drive to Strong with a picnic or a swim at Strong Public Beach on Porter Lake (off Beach Road) or drop your canoe into the Sandy River at the Devil's Elbow on Route 4 and paddle down to Farmington through some Class II rapids.
C'mon, it's called Devil's Elbow. You know you want to check it out.
7. Is UMaine home to 7,796 hooked rugs?
2) False, but the Page Farm and Home Museum, located on campus and depicting life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, probably has a hooked rug or three.
Now go: To Orono where there are loads of other collections to behold! UMaine's Fogler Library houses 6,000 rare books and 315 manuscript collections (including the papers of Vice President Hannibal Hamlin and C.C. Little, the founder of Jackson Lab). Materials are accessible with at least a week's notice.
8. Found in Leeds?
2) A French-speaking kids' summer camp. The website for camp Tekakwitha (as run through Google translator) describes it as "a French holiday camp in Maine in the United States, nestled at the edge of a vast wilderness lake." It's even accredited by the Association of Quebec Camps.
(Bonus facts: Mike and Oogie, very real roosters, were from neighboring North Turner and did such things as sit on their owner's shoulders while he played cards. And, according to the Ag Census, all of Androscoggin County had 5,769 cows at last count, so everyone walking on two legs definitely has the numerical upper-hand.)
Now go: To Leeds! Let's leave the summer camp kids alone -- they've got all kinds of summering and kid-being to do -- and instead, let's go on a historic hike.
Turns out Leeds is also home to what may be Maine's only peace monument, according to Richard Fochtmann at the Leeds Historical Society. Park on North Road and follow the short Monument Hill Trail to the granite obelisk with the words "Peace Was Sure Then" around its base, erected by the Howard brothers in 1895, 30 years after the end of the American Civil War.
"Most of the monuments that went up about the Civil War were about the soldiers who fought in it," said Fochtmann. "This was not to the fallen; this was to the peace that came after."
9. In store at the Maine Seaweed Festival?
We played a salty trick there: It's all three! A seaweed dance by a Middlebury College professor, new kelp ice cream and the novelty of attending the only such festival in the U.S.
Now go: To where the seaweed roams! The second annual Maine Seaweed Festival will take place on Aug. 29 in South Portland at Southern Maine Community College. Festival founder Hillary Krapf said last year 1,500 people came out and she's expecting a bigger crowd this year as the festival grows in food offerings, workshops and live demos.
The festival is about raising awareness of "our vibrant macro algae industry here," Krapf said. "We also want our community to understand that they have access to these valuable nutrients and this beautiful, sustainable natural resource right in our back yard."
(She was inspired by Kelpfest in Laguna Beach, Calif., which celebrates the restoration of local kelp forests; similar, but not quite the same as ours in Maine.)
10. The "Center of the Known Universe"?
3) Bucksport. Obviously. In 2013, the town announced plans to inscribe that phrase on its Waterfront Walkway, according to a story in the Bangor Daily News. (It basically began as a somewhat-joking reference to Bucksport's proximity to other job centers and then development officials decided, "hey, why not?" and ran with the phrase.)
In just the last month, Bucksport has nearly finished the project, according to a clerk in the town office. The area has benches, more signs are coming and it's a beautiful spot to view Fort Knox and the Penobscot Narrows Bridge, she said.
Now go: To Prospect (right across the river from Bucksport)! For $5 per adult at the Fort Knox Historic Site, you can explore the old fort (bring a lantern for the cool, dark corridors) and then take a 40-story elevator ride to the top of the Penobscot Narrows Observatory where you may feel, while looking down, on top of the world, if not the universe.

Abstract: "Having considered the filings, the factual background and legislative record, the constitutional context of the language at issue, long-held traditions and practices of Maine governors and Legislatures, and the analysis and precedents of other jurisdictions, each of us is of the opinion that a temporary legislative adjournment does not prevent the return of the bills with the governor's objections to the Legislature," the justices wrote in their unanimous finding. "During such a temporary adjournment, the governor may return the bills and his objections to the officers and agents of the originating house." "This was not about winning or losing; it was about doing things right," [Paul R. LePage] said in the prepared statement.

"As he has stated, the governor's aim with these vetoes was to waste the Legislature's time," the group's co-founder Lance Dutson said in a prepared statement. "We hope that this ruling will result in a different pattern of conduct from this administration, one that more closely resembles the tradition of Maine Republican statesmanship that so many of our elected officials have exemplified. The time for political games, inflammatory rhetoric and irresponsible governing is over."

The opinion came just six days after the court heard lawyers for LePage and the Legislature's caucus leaders make their case, with one side arguing LePage had missed his veto deadline and the other suggesting the Legislature was adjourned, preventing the vetoes.
"Having considered the filings, the factual background and legislative record, the constitutional context of the language at issue, long-held traditions and practices of Maine governors and Legislatures, and the analysis and precedents of other jurisdictions, each of us is of the opinion that a temporary legislative adjournment does not prevent the return of the bills with the governor's objections to the Legislature," the justices wrote in their unanimous finding. "During such a temporary adjournment, the governor may return the bills and his objections to the officers and agents of the originating house."
In a statement issued shortly after the court's opinion was released, LePage said he was focused on "following the mandates of the Maine Constitution."
"This was not about winning or losing; it was about doing things right," LePage said in the prepared statement. "We are fortunate to be able to seek legal opinions from the judicial branch, and we're thankful the justices came to a fast and fair resolution to this issue. We look forward to moving on and continuing to work for the Maine people."
House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, consistently said the bills in question were law because LePage missed his veto deadline.
On Thursday, Eves called LePage's efforts to have the high court overturn the laws "legal gymnastics."
"The decision affirms these bills are law," Eves said in a prepared statement. "The governor must enforce them. The ruling also reaffirms the Constitution, historical precedent and honors the separation of powers in our democracy that protects against partisanship and abuse of power."
Eves was also quick to note the decision had a major impact on the lives of some 13,000 Maine women who would now receive expanded access to health care because the bills were finally law.
"The decision is a victory and a huge win for Maine women, families, seniors and veterans, who will see great benefits from the laws we passed," Eves said.
Also weighing in on the matter Thursday was Maine Attorney General Janet Mills. Mills previously issued an opinion the bills in question had already become law.
"The Office of the Attorney General is pleased with the full and complete responses to the Governor's questions elucidated in the unanimous, 47-page opinion today," Mills said in a prepared statement. "The opinion of the justices is on all fours with all the research conducted by our office and with the opinion of the Attorney General of July 10, 2015. We are also pleased that the court ruled expeditiously so as to avoid any further unnecessary debate and confusion."
Mills went on to say the court's answers were "clear, unambiguous and completely consistent with (LePage's) own past practice and with that of every other governor in recent memory."
Meanwhile, a newly formed group of Republicans, Get Maine Right, who are critical of LePage's confrontational leadership style, also issued a statement.
"As he has stated, the governor's aim with these vetoes was to waste the Legislature's time," the group's co-founder Lance Dutson said in a prepared statement. "We hope that this ruling will result in a different pattern of conduct from this administration, one that more closely resembles the tradition of Maine Republican statesmanship that so many of our elected officials have exemplified. The time for political games, inflammatory rhetoric and irresponsible governing is over."
Among the laws in question were those that allow cities and towns to provide General Assistance welfare benefits to asylum-seeking immigrants for up to two years, and one that would allow women on the state's low-income health insurance program, MaineCare, to receive the same preventative care required of private insurers under the federal Affordable Care Act, including cancer screenings, annual exams, Pap tests, birth control and STD testing.
The new laws also include ones that would provide about $12 million in state funding for county jails over the next two years and one that would form a citizen task force to review the services provided by the Maine Bureau of Veterans Services.

Young blues phenoms the Petersons playing NA blues fest

Abstract: "Our older brother listens to hip hop, and so do we," said Glenn Peterson, who just turned 18 and graduated from high school. "But we started listening to old school funk and blues and liked it. It makes you move, and bands are jamming and having fun." "He was really the first blues artist we were aware of," continued Glenn. "We just asked if we could meet him because all they could do is say no. Then he invited us on the bus with him. He didn't just talk to us about music. He gave us a lot of life advice. He told us that if it was something we wanted, to stick with it no matter what other people tell you." Older brother Glenn added a more philosophical note to the experience. "To me, this is all true American music," said Glenn. "It is one of the ultimate forms of expression, and the blues can be anything you happen to be feeling."

Brothers of the blues, Glen and Alex Peterson, will appear at the North Atlantic Blues Festival in Rockland, Saturday and Sunday, July 11 and 12, beginning at 11 a.m.
America's history, culture, and soul suffered a great loss when blues legend B.B. King died earlier this year. He brought blues into the mainstream world and inspired a later generation, comprised of equally legendary Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, and Eric Clapton, to embrace American blues.
For those blues-infused rock icons, B.B. King was a hero introduced to them through teenage record collections. They dreamed of playing like B.B. King and many of them eventually shared the stage with them.
But how many high school kids actually get to open for B.B. King? How many get invited on the tour bus to chill and talk and get advice from the master? Two rare talents from Bastrop, Texas near Austin have had that privilege.
These same two brothers, who by the way were also invited on stage by none other than Buddy Guy to jam out an encore with him, are part of a new generation discovering and preserving the blues. And they are part of an all-star lineup at the annual North Atlantic Blues Festival in Rockland that features headliners James Cotton and Marcia Ball this year and such blues royalty as Robert Cray and Koko Taylor in previous years.
"Our older brother listens to hip hop, and so do we," said Glenn Peterson, who just turned 18 and graduated from high school. "But we started listening to old school funk and blues and liked it. It makes you move, and bands are jamming and having fun."
Glenn Peterson, the elder of the duo, explained that the discovery happened because he and his brother Alex tagged along with their mother and grandmother to garage sales. One of those outings netted a plastic tub full of old records, which included some by B.B. King.
Without any tone of bragging, the brothers recalled the time they got to hang out with B.B. King. They played regularly in a club near home on Sundays and were asked to open for King. They consulted with each other as to whether they would dare ask to meet their blues idol.
"He was really the first blues artist we were aware of," continued Glenn. "We just asked if we could meet him because all they could do is say no. Then he invited us on the bus with him. He didn't just talk to us about music. He gave us a lot of life advice. He told us that if it was something we wanted, to stick with it no matter what other people tell you."
Younger brother Alex, 16, said the entire conversation felt like talking to a regular person. He has come to adopt the blues philosophy that music is about life, and music makes people feel good
"Music makes people have a good time and forget about what they might be going through at home," said Alex. "We listen to all kinds of music. We'll just keep doing this as long as we have fun."
And their parents, neither of whom are musical, are right there behind their boys. Their mother, Deanna, said it isn't any different than when she and her husband would get their oldest son to his football practices and games. "They love it, and this is what they do," said Deanna Peterson, who added that Glenn just received an academic scholarship and will be starting college close to home in the fall.
She didn't mention that the boys just recorded and released their first album, "The Peterson Brothers" on Blue Point Records. The 11-track album showcases Alex's natural bass prowess (insert heavy Marcus Miller influence) and Glenn's lead guitar licks on a combination of original compositions and traditional covers.
For three weeks after school started, the brothers went into the studio after their classes and put on the finishing touches of the album. Alex said the recording experience taught him to be focused and relaxed at the same time.
"It made me super happy," said Alex. "It was fun. It was jammin'."
Older brother Glenn added a more philosophical note to the experience. "To me, this is all true American music," said Glenn. "It is one of the ultimate forms of expression, and the blues can be anything you happen to be feeling."

Full text:   WARREN -- A 61-year-old Warren man was charged Friday after police said he slit the throat of his injured cat with a dull knife.
Terrance Winslow of Oyster River Road was charged with a Class D criminal offense of cruelty to animals and a civil violation of failure to provide medical attention to an animal, according to Knox County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Tim Carroll. A Class D offense carries a maximum jail term of a year in jail.
According to Carroll, the cat was struck by a car on June 29 and suffered a leg injury that was not life-threatening. Winslow called a veterinarian, who said someone would come pick up the cat and treat it.
Winslow left his home and, when he returned later that same day, found the cat had not yet been picked up by the veterinarian. At that point, Winslow took a dull knife and cut the cat's throat in an attempt to euthanize the animal, Carroll said. The veterinarian did arrive later, however, and took the cat, which was still alive but later died from the knife wound, the chief deputy reported.
Carroll said Sgt. John Palmer investigated the case and issued the summonses to Winslow on Friday.

Maine Golf: Waterville, Martindale to host MSGA majors this summer

Author: Oakes, Kalle

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]28 June 2015.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1691542961?accountid=10457

Abstract: August 11-13, Match Play Invitational, Martindale CC, Auburn. Here's the tournament where you can expect the unexpected, with high seeds falling early and often. In the first five years of this tournament -- begun by popular demand of the players after the Maine Amateur returned to a stroke-play format -- nobody has appeared in the final more than once. Bitten by the format in years past, Jones put together four birdies in the 2014 final and claimed one of the state's few crown jewels that had eluded him, needing only 14 holes to dispatch Jeff Cole. Martindale welcomes the top 32 MSGA performers this summer after the tournament's previous visits to Augusta, Natanis, Fox Ridge and Sable Oaks. July 7-9, Maine Amateur, Waterville CC, Oakland. You might see lower scores and more names within shouting distance of the leader board at the MSGA's headline event for amateurs this summer. Last year's showcase was played at Woodlands Club in Falmouth, which proved a ferocious test for the state's best. It suited Andrew Slattery of West Minot just fine. Slattery, who has played serious competitive golf for less than a decade, held off Bryant University standout Joe Walp of Portland by one shot for the biggest win of his life. Ricky Jones, Matt Greenleaf, [Joe Alvarez] and ageless Mark Plummer will be players to watch throughout the 54-hole test.

Full text:   The major championship season for Maine golf is upon us.
Sun Journal file photo
Joe Alvarez tees off during the semifinal of the 2013 Maine Match Play Invitational at Fox Ridge Golf Course in Auburn. After a year at Sable Oaks in South Portland, the match play championhsip returns to the Twin Cities this summer, this time at Auburn's Martindale Country Club in August.
Two near-century-old gems return to the Maine State Golf Association schedule this summer. Waterville Country Club in Oakland draws the curtain a week from Tuesday, July 7, with the opening round of the Maine Amateur. In August, the Match Play Invitational returns to the Twin Cities for the second time in three summers, this time at Martindale Country Club in Auburn.
There will be ample opportunity to catch top-flight golf in the southern corridor of the state, as well, with the Maine Women's Amateur, Junior Amateur and Mid-Amateur covering the map in Cumberland and York counties.
To kick off our weekly, summer golf page, here's the skinny on what to expect and where to find it in the coming weeks:
July 7-9, Maine Amateur, Waterville CC, Oakland. You might see lower scores and more names within shouting distance of the leader board at the MSGA's headline event for amateurs this summer. Last year's showcase was played at Woodlands Club in Falmouth, which proved a ferocious test for the state's best. It suited Andrew Slattery of West Minot just fine. Slattery, who has played serious competitive golf for less than a decade, held off Bryant University standout Joe Walp of Portland by one shot for the biggest win of his life. Ricky Jones, Matt Greenleaf, Joe Alvarez and ageless Mark Plummer will be players to watch throughout the 54-hole test.
July 27-28, Charlie's Maine Open, Augusta CC, Manchester. Everyone involved hopes for a kiss from Mother Nature this year after torrential rain abbreviated the 2014 open to a single-day, 18-hole affair. Playing in one of the final groups of the day, Andrew Mason of Pennsylvania fired a sizzling 62 and won by two strokes. The tournament returns to the short, tempting Augusta track for the fourth consecutive season after a 52-year hiatus. Dustin Cone (2012) and Evan Harmeling (2013) are other recent winners.
July 27-29, Maine Women's Amateur, Biddeford-Saco CC. After many years as two separate tournaments, the showcase for female golfers has gained plenty of luster with all the top player competing under one umbrella in recent years. Leslie Guenther of Norway Country Club gave away the lead to Mary Brandes, took it back and outlasted a rain delay for her first victory under the new format. It was a mild surprise. Emily Bouchard, who dominated in 2013 and 2014, finished fifth place, seven shots off the pace, in her bid for a third consecutive title. Bad news for the field this season: The tournament moves from Waterville to Biddeford-Saco, Bouchard's home course.
August 5-6, Maine Junior Amateur, Toddy Brook GC, North Yarmouth. Will Kannegieser of Minot has won the boys' senior division of this tournament in back-to-back seasons. He defended the title with a two-shot victory over Bangor's Drew Powell at Val Halla in Cumberland. Kelsie Dessent of Fairfield was a runaway winner in the girls' overall competition a year ago.
August 11-13, Match Play Invitational, Martindale CC, Auburn. Here's the tournament where you can expect the unexpected, with high seeds falling early and often. In the first five years of this tournament -- begun by popular demand of the players after the Maine Amateur returned to a stroke-play format -- nobody has appeared in the final more than once. Bitten by the format in years past, Jones put together four birdies in the 2014 final and claimed one of the state's few crown jewels that had eluded him, needing only 14 holes to dispatch Jeff Cole. Martindale welcomes the top 32 MSGA performers this summer after the tournament's previous visits to Augusta, Natanis, Fox Ridge and Sable Oaks.
August 26-27, Maine Senior Amateur, Brunswick GC. Lowell Watson ended a 13-year drought between titles, prevailing at Penobscot Valley last summer. Watson had been knocking on the door with finishes of second and third since the turn of the decade. Plummer picked up the win when the tourney last appeared at Brunswick in 2012.
Sept. 12-13, Maine Mid-Amateur, Val Halla CC, Cumberland. Keith Patterson carded the only under-par round of the 36-hole tournament to win his first major MSGA individual title a year ago, when the tournament was played at York and The Ledges. Jones has won it six times. Alvarez owns three titles.
Sept. 18-20, Tri-State Matches, at Manchester CC, Vermont. Maine's delegation finally took home bragging rights two years ago, but New Hampshire gained a measure of revenge in 2014.
Other events to watch: Mixed Championship at Boothbay Harbor, July 12; U.S. Amateur qualifier at The Ledges, July 14; Class B and C Championship at Dutch Elm, July 14-15; New England Amateur at Baker Hill CC, Newbury, N.H., July 21-23; New England Junior Amateur, Purpoodock Club, Cape Elizabeth, August 16-18; Maine Four-Ball Championship, Fox Ridge GC, Auburn, Sept. 1-2; New England Senior Amateur, Oyster Harbors, Massachusetts, Sept. 29-30.

Abstract: Armistice puts the onus on the selective eater. You tell the person that you'll be making a salad and would love to have them bring a dish they can eat. When I was a vegan, I always volunteered to bring my own main dish and supplementary dessert, because vegans who expect non-vegans to suddenly learn to cook for them are history's greatest monsters. People with seriously restricted diets should not be offended if you say, "I'm afraid I don't have any good recipes that fit your dietary requirements; would you mind bringing something you like for the table?" Trust me, they're used to it.

Full text:   These days, it's common to give a dinner party where you find that one person's a vegan, a second eats gluten free, the third is allergic to tree nuts and a fourth will not eat shellfish or berries. After you add up all the religious and moral prohibitions, the allergies, the sensitivities and the preferences, what remains to serve your guests is . . . a nice big helping of air. HEPA-filtered, low-humidity air.
There are three basic strategies you can employ here: capitulation, divide and conquer, or armistice.
Capitulation is for those who are grimly determined to find a menu that will enable you to serve all of your guests the same thing. You ruthlessly chuck out any dish that contains one of the offending ingredients. You find yourself perusing websites of obscure cuisines in the hope that the Afghan Kyrgyz nomads may have a solution to your problem. (They don't.) Then you set aside your weekend to procure ingredients and cook things you have never made before.
Divide and conquer begins with acceptance. You accept that not everyone will be able to eat everything you cook. For example, we often dine with couples who have one vegetarian and one meat eater. So I make steak and serve mushroom vol-au-vents on the side, doubling up the vol-au-vents for the vegetarian. Or grilled chicken with a side of some vegetarian pasta like pesto or caprese. You think of a meal like a Venn diagram: Not every item has to go on every plate, but every plate must have some items and every item must go on some plates.
Armistice puts the onus on the selective eater. You tell the person that you'll be making a salad and would love to have them bring a dish they can eat. When I was a vegan, I always volunteered to bring my own main dish and supplementary dessert, because vegans who expect non-vegans to suddenly learn to cook for them are history's greatest monsters. People with seriously restricted diets should not be offended if you say, "I'm afraid I don't have any good recipes that fit your dietary requirements; would you mind bringing something you like for the table?" Trust me, they're used to it.

Full text:   BOOTHBAY HARBOR (AP) -- The first tall ship festival of the summer in Maine features a parade of ships and fireworks.
Seven windjammers are participating in a Parade of Sail Wednesday evening during Boothbay Harbor's Windjammer Days festival. Besides the windjammers, the festival features a tug-a-war contest across the harbor, a lobster-eating contest, an oyster-shucking contest and other events before it wraps up this weekend.
Another tall ship event is set for next month in Portland Harbor. That event will feature the Coast Guard training barque Eagle along with vessels from as far away Spain.

Full text:   Also on this page: Legislators busy overturning vetoes
AUGUSTA -- The Legislature on Monday overturned a veto of a bill to create a task force to examine the safety and possible regulations for farm amusement rides, such as the haunted hayride that claimed the life of an Oakland teen last fall.
The House voted 146-0 to overturn by Republican Gov. Paul LePage's veto, while the Senate voted 29-6 to overturn.
The bill, LD 1057, was a response to the death of Cassidy Charette, 17, who was killed when a Jeep pulling a wagon full of people went out of control and crashed in the woods at Harvest Hill Farms in Mechanic Falls on Oct. 11, 2014.
Investigators pointed toward mechanical problems with the late-model Jeep and experts questioned whether it was hauling too heavy a load.
Another 22 people were injured in the mishap, which is under review by an Androscoggin County grand jury to determine if the operators of the hayride committed a crime.
LePage vetoed the bill, sponsored by Rep. Robert Nutting, R-Oakland, saying the measure would divert state resources that would be better spent fighting illegal drugs in Maine.
"I have tried to explain to members of the Legislature that resolves that mandate (the Department of Public Safety) complete reports often harm the public safety of the state of Maine," LePage wrote. "If this bill becomes law, resources that could be used to address the most pressing public safety concerns facing our state will instead be used to address a public safety concern that is plainly not as serious as the use of illegal drugs destroying the lives of thousands of Maine citizens."
Under the bill, the Office of the State Fire Marshal and the Department of Public Safety are directed to form a group of stakeholders to determine how and if Maine should regulate amusement rides offered at farms around the state.
The state Fire Marshal's Office is responsible for inspecting the safety of rides such as those operated at fairs, carnivals and amusement parks.
But, during testimony on the bill, State Fire Marshal Joe Thomas said his investigators had no experience in inspecting farm vehicles or hayrides for safety concerns.
The task force, which will include representatives from the Maine Farm Bureau and the state's campground association, is expected to offer recommendations for ensuring the safety of those who pay to take a ride at a farm. That report is due back to the Legislature in February 2016.
Lawmakers will then decide whether they need to put in place a process to permit and inspect amusement rides offered at farms.

Legislators busy overturning vetoes
AUGUSTA (AP) -- Maine's Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has overturned 12 vetoes issued by Republican Gov. Paul LePage.
The House voted 143-4 to keep alive a bill that seeks to expand access to medicine that counteracts allergic reactions. Democratic Rep. Matt Peterson's bill would allow places like summer camps and day care facilities to be prescribed and administer injections of epinephrine.
The House overrode LePage's veto of 11 other bills on Monday. Five vetoed bills were sustained and are now dead.
The Republican-controlled Senate overturned LePage's veto of four bills, including one that would allow non-residents attending college in Maine to get hunting and fishing licenses at the cost of a resident's license.
The Senate sustained one LePage veto of a bill regarding campaign finance laws.

Full text:   'You will come to appreciate the price of clams'
Footwear failure, fatigue confront novice diggers in quest for elusive mollusk
Tom Blanchard was the first to lose his boot to the mud.
There was a slurpy wet sucking sound followed by a brief groan. Tom's foot came up out of the muck, but his footwear did not. He stood on one leg, desperately flailing his arms while his stockinged foot hung in the air like an ugly bird.
"The boot came off my foot," he told me later, "before I knew anything was happening."
That's how the clam flats get you, friend. One of the ways, anyway.
You can't say we weren't warned. Before we went anywhere near the mucky expanse at Wolfe's Neck Woods State Park in Freeport, guide Michael Frey cautioned us that clams wouldn't be just jumping into our buckets in delicious surrender. To get to the bivalve mollusks we were going to have to stomp and slop and squish our way through the grayish muck that would suck at our feet and try to bring us down.
"That muck wants your boots more than you do," Frey said. "We're all going to get muddy. It's a muddy business."
And a bit of a back-breaker, when you get right down to it. It's not only that the clams won't politely deposit themselves into our pails, they hide in scattered spots under all that muck, rarely gathering in convenient clusters.
To find a clam, you must first look for tiny air holes in the mud that might indicate their presence. Might. The only way to find out is to use your claw-like clam rake to dig.
"We're going after the soft shells," Frey told us. "They can be down pretty deep."
The clam rakes are short, with handles just a foot or so long. To tear a hole in that stubborn mud, you have get down on your haunches or your knees, maintaining precarious balance while using your pulling muscles to dig. The fishy stench of the muck assaults you like a punch to the nose. The thigh muscles burn, the lower back aches.
"You will come to appreciate the price of clams," Frey told us.
The human eye wants to seize upon anything bearing even a vague resemblance to a clam under all that mud, but that's not how it works. The soft-shell creatures we're after have to be at least two inches long, according the rules of shellfish harvesting in Maine.
While I'm digging, I hear a man named Joe Olimpio muttering behind me.
"Nope, too small. Nope, this is just a piece of shell. Nope . . . I don't know WHAT this is."
When he finally found a clam, it had a giant, ragged hole in the side of its shell, which rendered the mollusk useless. Where did that hole come from? Why, from the tip of a clam rake tine, of course. You have to attack the mud at an angle to avoid this, which, of course, only makes things more difficult.
You know what? I don't think the seafood joints charge nearly enough for clams, now that I know what I know.
Footwear, footwear, footwear
Clamming is hard business. So, why are nearly a dozen of us out here stomping through the stinky muck in the pouring rain? Why, particularly when we are not getting paid for the work? Why, especially when the chances are slim that any of us will collect enough clams to make a meal out of?
Why, indeed.
Jim Fay recently moved to Maine from Vermont. He came with his family, his motivation of the "when in Rome" variety.
"I figured if we're going to live in Maine," Fay said, "we've got to learn to dig for clams."
Tom Blanchard, he of the missing boot, came with his wife, Lisa. He did some lobstering back in the '60s and '70s, so he knows his way around a shellfish.
"It's a matter of learning to do it right," Tom said.
His wife Lisa? Well, she's mostly hungry. The lady loves clams and, though she lives in Texas now, she is a Mainer through and through. Lisa is a little bit ashamed that this is her first time out on the flats.
"And I'm a 13th-generation Mainer. Can you believe that?" Lisa said. "I'm going to get out there and get my own supper."
Clams and beer, that's what Lisa was all about. But to get it herself, she was going to have to stomp her way across the flats, searching for air holes that were very hard to spot in the rain, and she was going to have to dig.
God bless Lisa's appetite, I never once saw her taking a break or getting anywhere near close to quitting throughout the ordeal . . . ur, event.
"I find the hardest part is walking in this mud," Lisa said. "I think having the right footwear is a big part of it."
Ah, yes. The footwear. The professionals tend to use waders, which rise from their feet all the way up to their armpits. Our group, on the other hand, wore a little bit of everything, from flip-flops ("I don't care if I lose them," said the woman wearing them. "That will just give me an excuse to go buy more shoes.") to sneakers, to Bog boots to basic work boots that lace up and prevent the mud from eating them.
"I went into my daughter's closet," said Lisa Blanchard. "She's not going to be very happy when she notices that her Bog boots are gone."
For Lisa, walking was the great difficulty. For others, it was the strain on the lower back. And for a few, it was the burning on the leg muscles.
Tom Blanchard summed up his complaint in one word: "Lungs."
Facing the clam pee
Clamming IS vigorous exercise, and yet there are men and women up and down the coast who do this for a living. They catch enough of the quiet, elusive clams to put dinner in the mouths of local families and free-spending tourists who invade Maine each summer. The latest study on the value of the Maine shellfish industry found that the total economic impact of the shellfish industry is around $56 million, with $29.9 million going to Maine residents as employment income.
That includes a lot of clams. Which means a lot of sloshing through the mud, a lot of bending and a lot of digging. According to Frey, some of the professionals will work through two tides in a day, which means a lot of hours on the clam flats.
As you can by now surmise, it isn't glamorous. The first clam I saw plucked from the mud belonged to Olimpio, who lives in New Hampshire but who volunteers at Wolfe's Neck. The clam didn't treat him nicely.
"It was peeing all over me," Olimpio said.
"He's not actually peeing," Frey assured us. "He's just getting rid of water."
Which may or may not have comforted Olimpio. Within seconds, he was back in the mud, digging a hole quite close to the first one he'd dug.
"I don't know about stomping all over the place," he said. "I'd just find a spot and stick to it."
That strategy went against everything we were told about air holes rising from the mud, but what could we say? By the time the day was over, nobody had collected more clams that Olimpio.
It turned out he was a ringer. Sort of.
"I do have a clamming license," he said. "But every time I've gone out, the flats have been closed. Red tide or whatever. I'm really just a rookie. I have no idea what I'm doing."
Olimpio managed to collect four or five clams, but that's far short of a meal for an average person. Nobody on the flats that day gathered enough clams to fill the tummy, but collectively we did all right. By the time we walked off the flats, muddy, wet and sore, we had maybe a dozen clams among us.
We gave them to Lisa Blanchard, who had worked so hard for so little. She didn't even have to share them with her husband, who doesn't care for clams.
"That's all right," Tom said. "She likes them enough for the both of us."
About the clam
Two kinds of clams are harvested in Maine: soft-shell and hard-shell. Both are harvested year round, with the peak season in the summer months.
Hard-shell clams are often called quahogs, cherry stones or little necks (depending on their size). They live closer to the surface of the ocean floor.
Soft-shell clams, aka steamers, have rather thin, brittle shells, so you have to be more gentle with them. They live in the mud, sand and gravel intertidal areas, and tend to bury themselves far deeper in the mud than hard-shell varieties.
Today the soft-shell harvest averages around 10 million pounds per year, with the value of soft-shell clams increasing over time, making soft-shell clams Maine's third most valuable fishery.
Clams feed by drawing in water through a siphon. The food is filtered out of the water by the gills and swept into the mouth by a layer of mucus. The water is then expelled from the animal through an ex-current siphon. Soft-shell clams have longer siphons, allowing them to bury themselves deeper.
Since clams are filter feeders, the presence of clams and other bivalves in the water actually improves water quality.
The health and stability of Maine clam populations are threatened by pollution and poor water quality caused by agricultural and residential runoff, increased shore development and aging infrastructure. Additionally, clams are threatened by the invasive green crab, whose populations have exploded in recent years due to warming temperatures.

'The Clam Digger,' by Delicia Powers
With his back bent over the mudflats
Busy reaping the shore
The clam-digger . . .
His face stern and weather-worn
By endless seasons of early morns.
Made from hard work
The steel of his forearms
Dripping with sweat . . .
He works alone
On the salty ocean brim
Of Maine's history.

Full text:   LIVERMORE -- Hundreds of people visited the Norlands on Saturday to participate in or get an up-close history lesson on the Civil War.
A Civil War re-enactment will take place from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday, June 14, at the Norlands Living History Center in Livermore.
In a medical tent, anesthesiologist Bob Tillson spoke of needing to hold patients down during surgery. Anesthesia had been used for 20 years, but supplies were often unavailable.
Catrina MacKenzie was personifying Annie Etheridge, a young Michigan woman who enlisted with other ladies. The intention was for them to do laundry and cook meals.
Etheridge had nursing experience, so she borrowed a horse and filled saddlebags with bandages. She rode with the men into 32 battles where she performed basic first aid on the front lines. "She was credited with saving thousands of lives," MacKenzie said.
Maj. Gen. Kearny had planned to make Etheridge a sergeant, but he died before he could do so. He did bestow upon her the Kearny Cross for her valor. She once was shot in the hand while a soldier cowered behind her. The soldier was killed by the bullet.
After the war, Etheridge applied for a pension, but because she was a woman, she was at first turned down. She received so much support from generals and other officers that she was granted $25 per month. Etheridge was buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.
Kelly and Carrie Tessier were part of the Colonial Kids Club, demonstrating old-time children's games. "This is the best place ever for them," Carrie said.
The appearance of President Abraham Lincoln was popular. An honor guard stood at attention while waiting for him to leave. Capt. Pete Gilbert of the 118th New York, Richard and Benjamin Roy from the 3rd Maine and Steve Moody of the 2nd Vermont were members of that unit.
Stephen Wood gave an authentic portrayal of Lincoln as he spoke to the people gathered in the church. He then visited the Union troops and later took a meal with them.
John Peterson, portraying sutler Saul Goode, spoke of selling things to vary the soldiers' diets. Spoonfuls of butter and pickles were common items. Oysters were another favorite. "Two-thirds of the soldiers who perished in the Civil War; 400,000 men died in the camps from diseases," Peterson said.
Gray resident Steve Bunker was with a Maine Calvary Unit. He showed saddles designed by Gen. McClellan that were used during the war and re-enactment. On display were an 1858 McClellan saddle and a Grimsley artillery saddle. That saddle was designed to carry portmanteaus, not riders.
Tim Perkins was an adjutant with the 6th Battalion, part of the army of northern Virginia. Fifteen companies made up that Confederate battalion.
Jeremiah Dyer had fun trying on clothing from the Civil War era. He had tried out the children's games and was successful at the ring toss. "The hoop was kind of hard," he said.

Abstract: Several of the black limestone floor tiles in the Maine State House contain fossilized remains of marine invertebrates. The limestone was sourced from Vermont, though, so the fossils are not native to Maine. The tiles were installed over a 22-year period between 1889 and 1911, but the fossils were not discovered for nearly a century. Legislative employee and fossilphile Patrick Norton first recognized the fossils in stones outside the Governor's Office, under the dome and in hallways in 1992. The ocean, however, was teeming with life during the Devonian Period, so fossils from that time found in what is now Maine are more likely to evoke "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" than "Jurassic Park." "We've seen fossils that are starfish-like, jellyfish-like, corals, snails, sponges and trilobites, a kind of predecessor to horseshoe crabs," says Dr. Robert Marvinney, Maine state geologist.

Pertica quadrifaria is the official Maine state fossil. The primitive plant is believed to have been a critical step in both leaf development among plants and to have been among the first plants to develop a vascular system. Such modifications allowed for taller growth and for establishment away from bodies of water, leading to the evolution of trees. Fossils have been found in only three other locations in the world besides Maine.

This is a fossil of the primitive plant pertica quadrifaria. Fossils have been found in only four locations in the world, including Baxter State Park in Maine.
Backyards all across Maine will become sites of scientific exploration, as junior paleontologists excavate, hoping to find a complete, perfectly preserved T-rex or velociraptor skeleton.
Unfortunately for all those would-be Jack Horners and Paul Serenos, their dino-digs are almost certainly doomed, and not just because they'll be conducted with garden trowels and beach toys.
No dinosaur fossils have ever been discovered in Maine, and it's likely none ever will.
"There probably were dinosaurs here -- they've been found as close by as Nova Scotia and western Massachusetts -- but we have no way of knowing for sure," says Dr. David Work, chief scientist and curator of geology at the Maine State Museum and associate editor of the Journal of Paleontology.
The reason for the dearth of dinosaur remains is a nearly 300-million-year gap in Maine's fossil record.
The glaciers responsible for carving out Maine's distinctive craggy landscape during the Pleistocene Epoch -- a period between about 2.5 million and 12,000 years ago -- abraded more than 400 feet of earth from the state's surface, scouring away a massive chunk of geological history in the process.
As a result, all of the fossils found in Maine so far date from either the past 12,000 years, after the last glacier receded, or from more than 400 million years ago, during a warm, fertile age called the Devonian Period (named for Devon County, England, where fossils from the period were first discovered, not for new-wave band Devo).
The first land animals didn't emerge from the ocean -- and there was only one ocean, dubbed Panthalassa by scientists, that covered 85 percent of the planet -- until the end of that period.
The dinosaurs appeared much later: They walked the earth between about 250 and 65 million years ago.
The ocean, however, was teeming with life during the Devonian Period, so fossils from that time found in what is now Maine are more likely to evoke "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" than "Jurassic Park."
The most common type of fossils found in Maine are brachiopods, shelled clam-like organisms that lived in shallow ocean water. Like most bivalve mollusks today -- a family that includes clams, scallops and mussels -- prehistoric brachiopods buried themselves in the sediment, leaving behind impressions of their shells as the bedrock formed over time.
Then, when glaciers scraped away the top layers of the landmass that eventually became Maine, they scattered fragments of fossilized rock around for modern-day rockhounds to find.
Work, at the Maine State Museum, says people come into the museum 20 to 30 times a year with brachiopod fossils they've found, wanting to learn more about them.
"They're pretty little things, one or two inches long."
Other forms of sea life are also common finds.
"We've seen fossils that are starfish-like, jellyfish-like, corals, snails, sponges and trilobites, a kind of predecessor to horseshoe crabs," says Dr. Robert Marvinney, Maine state geologist.
While brachiopod fossils bear a close resemblance their modern relatives, trilobites look more like the alien prehistoric creatures they were. Their flat, ridged, oval bodies ranged in size from about an inch long to two feet. The marine arthropods were among the most successful early organisms on earth, reigning over the oceans for more than 270 million years before becoming extinct about 250 million years ago.
Maine's state fossil: pertica quadrifaria
As interesting as the sci-fi-like trilobites are, Marvinney says the most significant fossil found in Maine, by far, comes from a plant.
Maine's state fossil is pertica quadrifaria, a primitive plant that evolved during the Devonian Period. Fossilized remains of the plant were first discovered in 1968 in the rocks of the Trout Valley Formation in Baxter State Park, not far from Mount Katahdin.
Pertica featured stems that measured about an inch in diameter, with branches arranged in four rows that spiraled up and around the stem. Some branches featured spore cases for reproduction, and others subdivided to form forked tips that were probably the first step in the evolution of leaves.
It was the largest land plant at that time, reaching heights of about six feet.
While a prehistoric plant may lack the coolness factor of dinosaurs, pertica was incredibly important, because it was among the very first plants on Earth to develop a vascular system -- veins that allowed it to transport water from its roots to the rest of the plant.
This innovation allowed the plant to not only grow larger than a few inches, but also to move inland, away from constant water sources, for the first time in evolutionary history, ultimately resulting in the development of many modern plant species, including trees.
"By the end of the Devonian Period, some probably reached about 100 feet tall," says Work.
The fact that Maine was, at the time, a tropical location sitting well below the equator, explains how the massive plants were able to thrive.
Their development and proliferation were critical to the rise of animal and human life on the planet.
"Early land plants, like pertica, are responsible for the abundance of oxygen in our atmosphere," says Work.
This, in turn, paved the way for more animals to move from the oceans and onto the land.
Pertica fossils are also exciting to scientists and geology buffs because they are incredibly rare. Well-preserved remains of pertica have been found in only three other places in the world besides what is now Maine.
Because of its evolutionary importance, and because of its rarity and the fact that it was first discovered in Maine, pertica quadrifaria was designated Maine's official state fossil in 1985.
Maine's likely dinosaur inhabitants
Fossils are more than just an interesting oddity for kids and science buffs, though. Maine's fossil record has played an important role in helping geologists piece together a picture of not just what life on earth looked like hundreds of millions of years ago, but also what the earth, itself, looked like.
For instance, some brachiopod fossils found in Maine are more similar to those seen in Europe than in neighboring states. That and similar discoveries around the world have helped geologists form a picture of how the Earth's land masses were once shaped, and how tectonic activity has changed the continents over time.
Scientists believe there were two continents, Laurasia and Gondwana, during the Devonian Period, when most of Maine's fossils were formed.
"This was a very tumultuous time, with a lot of tectonic activity. This was right after the collision that formed the Appalachian Mountains," says Marvinney.
The earth's land masses were still moving during the Jurassic period, when dinosaurs roamed.
And while no dinosaur fossils have ever been found in Maine, discoveries in Nova Scotia, western Massachusetts and Connecticut shed light on what types of dinosaurs likely walked the land that eventually became Maine, and when.
Ammosaurus: At about 13 feet in length, ammosaurus was on the small side for a dinosaur. It was a versatile creature that was able to move on either two or four legs, and is also believed to have been omnivorous. It lived during the early and middle Jurassic Period, between 200 and 160 million years ago. Remains have been found in Nova Scotia and Connecticut.
Anchisaurus: A small herbivorous dinosaur possibly related to ammosaurus, anchisaurus was believed to be about six feet long, including the tail, and stood less than half the height of an average human. It lived during the early Jurassic Period, between 200 and 188 million years ago. Remains have been found in Nova Scotia, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
Plateosaurus: A bipedal herbivore with a very small head atop a long pliable neck, plateosaurus ranged from 16 to 33 feet long and weighed anywhere between 1,300 and 8,800 pounds. It lived during the late Triassic Period, around 214 to 204 million years ago. Remains have been found in Nova Scotia.
Podokesaurus: A small carnivorous dinosaur that was about three feet long and one foot tall, podokesaurus is believed to have been very nimble and fast. Its name comes from the Greek for "swift-footed lizard." It lived during the early Jurassic Period, between 200 and 188 million years ago, and is one of the earliest known dinosaurs to inhabit the eastern United States. Remains have been found in Massachusetts.
Although dinosaur remains have never been found in Maine, geologists say they have many other reasons for appreciating the remnants of the past that can be found here.
Marvinney says he enjoys working with Maine's fossil record to piece together the earth's past and enjoys understanding how minerals found in the earth are essential to every facet of modern civilization -- from the development of agriculture to the silicone now used in computer chips.
Work, at the museum, says he has a lot in common with all of those kids who'll soon be making messes of their parents' lawns. "Every kid seems to be interested in rocks and fossils. I just never outgrew it."

Full text:   Those who oppress the poor insult their Maker." -- Proverbs 14:31
It's not my habit to start a column with a quotation from the Bible, but this one's loaded with self-professed Christians, so why not?
In the mid-1990s, during my time as a metro reporter and feature writer for The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, I started writing stories about people who lived in poverty.
I learned early to avoid certain words and descriptions that ignited the ire of certain readers who would rather shame fellow Americans for their dire circumstances than consider why so many of them live in poverty. And often just blocks away from our front doors.
As a columnist, I still sometimes fall back on those rules:
Unless crucial to the story, don't refer to the flat-screen television in the living room or the car in the driveway, no matter how many miles are on it. A depressing number of people will want to know why a poor person needs a TV or an independent mode of transportation.
Avoid mentioning a tattoo unless it's central to the narrative. Even then, brace yourself for the onslaught of angry readers demanding to know whether taxpayer money paid for that ink.
And just skip the part about the gold cross dangling around the neck of the grieving mother. I admit this is born of self-preservation. The number of people who are more interested in how she got her jewelry than how her son died will eat at your soul.
So here we are, facing another round of legislative attempts to humiliate poor people who can't fight back. Lots of headlines but little noise from most of us. I'm not the cynic who thinks everybody's heart has shriveled to stone. I do, however, worry that our exhaustion is fueling these heartless victories.
In Missouri, the pending House Bill 813 stipulates, "A recipient of supplemental nutrition assistance program benefits shall not use such benefits to purchase cookies, chips, energy drinks, soft drinks, seafood, or steak."
This bill was introduced by state Rep. Rick Brattin, who identifies himself and his family on his website as "devoted Christians."
In Wisconsin, a new bill would dictate that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits could not be used to buy crab, lobster, shrimp or any other variety of shellfish.
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the Baptist preacher's son who insists his marching orders come from God, wants to take it further: Anyone who applies for unemployment, food stamps or another assistance program would have to prove his or her sobriety.
"This is not a punitive measure. This is about getting people ready for work," he said. "I'm not making it harder to get government assistance. I'm making it easier to get a job."
In Kansas, we have Gov. Sam Brownback, who last year said, "Our dependence is not on big government, but it's on a big God, who loves us and lives within us."
Brownback just signed a bill into law that prevents welfare recipients from spending their assistance on "expenditures in a liquor store, casino, jewelry store, tattoo or body piercing parlor, spa, massage parlor, nail salon, lingerie shop, tobacco paraphernalia store, vapor cigarette store, psychic or fortune telling business, bail bond company, video arcade, movie theater, swimming pool, cruise ship, theme park, dog or horse racing facility or sexually oriented retail business."
You might wonder whether there was any evidence of such widespread spending, but that would mean you're in search of facts and you're definitely not going to fit in with this crowd.
State Sen. Michael O'Donnell, also the son of a pastor who likes to mention Jesus when explaining his opposition to helping the poor, told the Topeka Capital-Journal last month: "We're trying to make sure those benefits are used the way they were intended. This is about prosperity. This is about having a great life."
Democratic state Sen. David Haley's response: "This is a troubling elitism here that this body is embracing during what, for many of us, is Holy Week. We really have to look in the mirror. We can't say something on Wednesday and shift gears on Sunday and think somebody isn't paying attention."
As the late Rev. William Sloane Coffin once put it, "it is ironic to think of the number of people in this country who pray for the poor and needy on Sunday and spend the rest of the week complaining that the government is doing something about them."
"Ironic" isn't the word that immediately comes to my mind, but what do I know? I'm just a Christian-in-training, not one of those experts willing to insult our maker.

Analysis: How to create a bill that LePage will veto

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]20 May 2015.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1682074340?accountid=10457

Abstract: The pattern continued earlier this month when [Paul LePage] vetoed LD 435, which would have continued a study of ways to reduce the threat of invasive green crabs to shellfish and lobsters. It's a concept LePage personally supported last year and which garnered unanimous legislative support this year. However, LePage's veto was upheld with a 16-19 vote in the Senate. A recurring theme throughout LePage's veto letters on bills calling for studies involves his belief that if the Legislature wants a study, it should assign the work to legislative staff. A staunch defender of the executive branch's authority and autonomy, LePage bristles at the notion that administrators or staff under his purview should undertake studies proposed by legislators. It's part of his fervent and ongoing efforts to consolidate power in the governor's office. Though LePage has vetoed far more Democratic bills than Republican ones -- which to some degree is the result of Democrats forcing "the election is coming" bills on him that they knew he would oppose in 2013 and 2014 -- LePage has not hesitated to veto Republican bills. Four of the 18 bills LePage has vetoed this session were sponsored by Republicans.

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- Gov. Paul LePage long ago established that he'll use the full breadth of his constitutional powers to advance the policy agenda he believes is best for Maine.
Sun Journal file photo
Gov. Paul LePage
He has withheld voter-approved bonds, refused to nominate people for the Public Utilities Commission and Board of Corrections, and perhaps most noticeably, he issued more than 200 vetoes during his first four-and-a-half years as governor. As has been well reported, that is far more vetoes than any other governor in Maine history.
However, in the first 18 vetoes since his re-election, LePage has established another truth: there are certain kinds of bills that he'll veto every time. Here's a look at patterns that are emerging -- or in this case, re-emerging.
LePage, for the most part, does not support studies.
Aside from probably the most infamous taxpayer-funded study in Maine history -- the Alexander Report, which LePage scuttled after revelations about plagiarism in its early phases -- numerous studies have fallen victim to LePage's veto pen. They have ranged from one on workplace bullying to another on whether Mainers are paying their fair share of taxes on items purchased online.
The pattern continued earlier this month when LePage vetoed LD 435, which would have continued a study of ways to reduce the threat of invasive green crabs to shellfish and lobsters. It's a concept LePage personally supported last year and which garnered unanimous legislative support this year. However, LePage's veto was upheld with a 16-19 vote in the Senate.
"Let's react to the data, not simply continue to extend this pilot," he wrote. "Now is the time to react to the information we have learned, not simply dither."
A recurring theme throughout LePage's veto letters on bills calling for studies involves his belief that if the Legislature wants a study, it should assign the work to legislative staff. A staunch defender of the executive branch's authority and autonomy, LePage bristles at the notion that administrators or staff under his purview should undertake studies proposed by legislators. It's part of his fervent and ongoing efforts to consolidate power in the governor's office.
He has no appetite for 'feel-good' bills.
Evidence of this can be found in LePage's veto of LD 377, a bill that would clear the way for the state to provide low-interest loans to movie and television production companies that produce or shoot films in Maine. This is an issue that lawmakers have been trying to gain traction on for years. They have passed laws -- including LD 377, unanimously -- but have not attached any funding.
"This piece of legislation is simply a feel-good bill," wrote LePage. "Either we fund it or get rid of it. Doing neither one makes no sense."
Legislative action on LePage's veto of this bill is pending.
If there are going to be changes to the tax code this year, they'll be LePage's.
Though he did not mention his intention to do so during last year's gubernatorial campaign, LePage has prioritized tax reform in his second term -- but he has signaled he'll support his own plan and no one else's.
Last month, the governor vetoed one bill that would have exempted library collaboratives from sales and service provider taxes and another bill that would have reduced registration fees and excise taxes on for for-hire vehicles for people with disabilities. Both were sustained by the Legislature. Then last week, LePage submitted a supplemental budget bill that included nearly identical language from the two vetoed bills.
"As you know, the Legislature is currently considering a comprehensive budget proposal that addresses our overall tax system and doesn't appear to have neared conclusion on those deliberations," wrote LePage in his veto letter, referring to his own biennial budget proposal. "Therefore, I do not believe it would be appropriate to support targeted exemptions on an isolated basis before the Legislature has acted."
If LePage's tax reform goals aren't supported by the Legislature -- which is looking more likely as the end of the fiscal year nears -- also going by the wayside will be the two bills LePage vetoed.
LePage vetoes bills from his own party.
Though LePage has vetoed far more Democratic bills than Republican ones -- which to some degree is the result of Democrats forcing "the election is coming" bills on him that they knew he would oppose in 2013 and 2014 -- LePage has not hesitated to veto Republican bills. Four of the 18 bills LePage has vetoed this session were sponsored by Republicans.
LePage is using leverage from his convincing election win last year. Even though he did not make reducing or eliminating the state income tax a major campaign theme, LePage is acting like his win was a mandate to cut it.
"I do not believe it would be appropriate to support targeted exemptions on an isolated basis before the Legislature has acted comprehensively to address the issue of the sales tax and reduce the oppressive burden that the income tax has placed on families and businesses in Maine," wrote LePage in two veto letters this year. "That is why the Maine people elected us and why I have vetoed this bill today."
LePage has a scripted end to his vetoes.
As if the reasoning within his letters is not enough, LePage ends the vast majority of his veto letters -- if not all of them -- with an identical phrase: "I strongly urge the Legislature to sustain it."

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- A bill designed to help control the spread of invasive green crabs died Thursday when the Senate failed to override a veto issued by Gov. Paul LePage.
Democratic Sen. Stan Gerzofsky of Brunswick, who sponsored the bill, said the veto has squandered years of work and resources dedicated to reversing the takeover of valuable shellfish flats by invasive green crabs. The bill would have extended a pilot program to study ways to eradicate them.
LD 435 received unanimous support on both the Marine Resources Committee and in the full Legislature earlier this year but was vetoed by LePage last week. The bill sought to extend the municipal predator control project, which allowed the study and implementation of measures to rid mudflats of invasive green crabs and bolster the population of valuable shellfish and marine worms, until November 2016.
Essentially, the bill would have restored the closure of certain mudflats to clam and worm harvesting to make way for more data collection.
The Senate voted 16-19 to sustain LePage's veto of the measure on Thursday. The vote was along party lines except for Sen. Tom Saviello, R-Wilton, who voted with Democrats in favor of overturning the veto. Voting against it was Marine Resources Committee Chairwoman Sen. Linda Baker, R-Topsham, who represents several coastal communities.
In his May 1 veto letter, LePage said he didn't support the bill that originally created the pilot project and vetoed this year's proposed extension because he believes its continuation is unnecessary.
"The pilot project has been conducted and the data has been gathered," wrote LePage. "Let's react to the data, not simply continue to extend this pilot ad infinitum."
LePage also criticized municipalities which, according to his letter, have invested in shellfish seeding efforts in anticipation of the pilot project being extended.
"That is unfortunate that these decisions were made before the legislation was enacted," wrote the governor.
Gerzofsky said in a written statement that he is disappointed that the bipartisanship that has been associated with this issue ended on Thursday.
"If we want to have clams this summer then we need to do something to protect Maine's shellfish industry," said Gerzofsky. "Furthermore, there is so much on the line for the many hard-working Maine people who rely on this industry to make a living."
Dan Devereaux, marine resources officer in Brunswick, said Thursday that from his perspective, valuable data has already been collected and mudflat protection measures implemented.
"When it comes down to predation, we've done everything we can in the pilot project that we're allowed to do," he said. "Even if the bill was passed, we probably would not have committed to another extensive predation study."
Gerzofsky disagreed that more study isn't warranted.
"We, as a state, have a responsibility to ensure sustainability for this key Maine industry by investing in and protecting it for future generations," he said. "If nothing is done to adequately protect our intertidal areas from green crabs, it will not be long before there is nothing left to harvest."
Softshell clam harvests in Maine dropped from 11.1 million pounds in 2012 to 10.6 million pounds in 2013. The drop was attributed largely to the spread of green crabs, though Devereaux said there are not as many now as there once were.
According to the Maine Clammers' Association, clamming employs more than 1,500 people in Maine and pays them nearly $30 million in total.

Full text:   REGION -- Steve Bronish of Livermore Falls is learning first hand about the power of social media.
A simple posting on his Facebook page "went from me offering to take a veteran out fishing to now, we're up to nine boats and 14 veterans," he noted.
Bronish, who works at Catalyst Paper in Rumford, is organizing an event for veterans the weekend of May 30th on Aziscohos Lake near Black Cove Campground, located in Lincoln Plantation. Besides a day of fishing, donations of food and time will mean there will also be a breakfast, a barbeque and an oyster feed.
Overwhelmed with joy how big this has gotten is an understatement, said Bronish. "What started out as an act of kindness has turned into an event."
He wrote on his Facebook page," If you know any veterans that would like to join us, please add them. If we don't have enough spots on boats, there are fly fishing and casting areas from shore everywhere in the area. Magalloway River, fly fishing only (headwaters of Aziscohos Lake and the outlet), Little Richardson, Cupsuptic River, Kennebego River, various beaver ponds. There will also be guys that will take you to these spots."
"There are still quite a few spots available in the campground with electricity on every site. Hot showers and flush toilets available at the huge bath house. They also have remote sites around the lake. Or if you just want to come up and site see. The area is well known for its moose population. You don't have to go far (sometimes even in the campground) to see a moose."
Bronish now has a Facebook site for event, called "Trolling With an American Veteran."
He said, "We've got four or five campsites Black Cove Campground, plus one of the guys up there, Frank Morris, has offered his camp on the Cupsuptic River that will hold six guys, too. My union pitched in 25 bucks towards the endeavor and I'm not really sure of the names, but there's been oysters donated, some organicly-grown beef donated. My daughters are coming up and will be cooking breakfast for everybody Saturday morning. My brother is going to help with cooking."
Bronish added, "I've got a couple veterans who are bringing boats up themselves."
Where did Bronish get the idea to take a veteran fishing?
He said he watches a fishing show, Charlie Moore Outdoors, seen on NESN. Back in 2008, Bronish trolled away a Tuesday afternoon with Charlie Moore for one of the episodes. Every once in a while, they'll show re-runs of the episode was in with the mad fishermen.
"I doubt if Charlie Moore would recognize me now. I've lost 230 pounds," Bronish noted.
One Saturday morning, while watching the show, he said to his fiancee, Heather McLennan, "Y'know, I'd like to do something like that. I've always wanted to take veterans out fishing."
"Before I did anything, I asked her if she wanted to do this with me, and she said, 'Sure, I'll do it," said Bronish, adding that McLennan is "going to be the one driving the boat and stuff until I get everybody situated. She's my first mate, I guess you'd say."
Bronish loves to fish and his favorite place to troll is on Aziscohos Lake. "I love it up there. I'd rather go there than anyplace else fishing. You don't have to worry about three-foot waves and the wind kicking up."
But that's not his primary reason for this event.
"It's my way of giving back to the people who offered to give their all for this country. I have several people in my family who have served and who are presently serving, including my youngest son Pvt. Andrew Bronish, who is presently in the Army," said Bronish, who noted many other family members have also served in the military.
"My younger brother was in the Navy. I have a nephew who was in the Navy. My fiancee's brother, Donny McLennan, was a 20-year veteran in the Paratrooper's, and his son, Donny, Jr., is in the service right now, and his daughter was in the service. I had lots of uncles, nephews, nieces and cousins -- I could probably start a book on everybody in my family whose been in the service," he said, adding, "I, myself, couldn't serve because of medical issues."
Bronish said this event has grown much larger than he ever imagined. "I'm loving it. It turned from a day of fishing with a couple guys to a whole armada! It should be quite a weekend up there.
He added that thanks to people's generosity, "there's not really anything I'm asking for. We can have people do a good weather dance, if they want."
Bronish is thinking that this may not be a one-time thing.
"Actually if everything turns out good, I have been talking to the other boat volunteers who might do another this fall. But definitely if there's a good turn out, I will make it a yearly event."

Casco Bay study links ocean acidity, shellfish decline

Abstract: FOCB tested the acidity of 30 clam flats identified as "productive" or "no longer productive." According to researcher Mike Doan, the group identified the flats after extensive talks with clammers, resource managers, and shellfish wardens.

Just as the nitrogen in fertilizer helps a lawn grow, the nitrogen "bonanza" running off into the bay "can stimulate the growth of large blooms of algae, beyond what animals in the ecosystem can consume," the report said.

Full text:   PORTLAND -- A study released Tuesday finds a link between high levels of ocean water acidity and declining soft-shell clam populations in Casco Bay.
The finding adds another piece to the puzzle of shellfish decline in the region, and suggests people can help limit the damage without even going near the water.
Landings of soft-shell clams have been steadily declining statewide since the late 1970s, from almost 40 million pounds in 1977 to just about 10 million pounds in 2014, according to data from the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
The new report, "A Changing Casco Bay," suggests a contributing factor to the drop is the bay's increasing acidity.
The study is the result of more than a decade of water quality sampling by volunteers and staff from the nonprofit Friends of Casco Bay. According to the group, their data collection methods have been repeatedly verified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
FOCB tested the acidity of 30 clam flats identified as "productive" or "no longer productive." According to researcher Mike Doan, the group identified the flats after extensive talks with clammers, resource managers, and shellfish wardens.
"We would ask, can you give us an example of a really healthy clam flat, and an extreme example of a really unproductive flat, of what they call 'dead mud,'" he said.
The researchers found a statistically significant difference in pH, the unit that describes the acidity of a solution, between the two groups.
"Three years of data show that areas with the highest acidity ... are the same flats where clams are now scarce," the report found.
A growing body of research has displayed how increasingly acidic seawater, fueled by worldwide increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, hinders the ability for young shellfish to build their protective shells.
More carbon dioxide in the air means that more dissolves into the ocean, where it reacts with water to form carbonic acid. This process lowers the pH of the water, making it more acidic.
Larval shellfish need the chemical compound calcium carbonate to build their shells. Young soft-shell clams, for example, pull calcium carbonate out of the seawater to build up their hard shells.
Generally speaking, the concentration of calcium carbonate decreases as oceans become more acidic, due to the influx of carbonic acid. More acid means less raw building material for young oysters, clams, and mussels.
FOCB's data shows this interaction happening at a local level, Doan said.
"We're seeing pH levels in the mud that are below the threshold (i.e., more acidic) of what's been shown in the lab to be detrimental to the smallest clams," he said.
'Double whammy'
So what's causing the bay to become more acidic?
FOCB describes the factors contributing to the lower pH levels in Casco Bay as a "double whammy."
The first driver of acidification is global climate change, the authors found. Over the past two hundred years, the world's oceans have become 30 percent more acidic, according to the Smithsonian Institution. This is faster than any known change in ocean chemistry in the last 50 million years.
But the authors also point to a more local cause of acidification in the bay.
At sites that the group has monitored for 13 years, FOCB found a statistically significant downward trend in pH, with ocean water becoming more acidic by 0.014 pH units per year.
"This is a serious and disturbing trend," the report found.
The authors suggest that a major reason for this increased acidity is nitrogen runoff from sewage, storm-water runoff, and air pollution.
The researchers came to this conclusion after noticing a trend of higher nitrogen levels closer to shore and decreased levels further away. "This is evidence that much of the excess nitrogen found in Casco Bay is coming from land-based activities," they said.
Nitrogen makes its way to the ocean through waste-water treatment discharges, fertilizer runoff from farms and city streets, and atmospheric fallout of vehicle and industrial emissions, the report said.
Nitrogen pollution causes acidification by spurring massive blooms of algae. Just as the nitrogen in fertilizer helps a lawn grow, the nitrogen "bonanza" running off into the bay "can stimulate the growth of large blooms of algae, beyond what animals in the ecosystem can consume," the report said.
Much of that algae ends up dying and settling in the mud. As that organic matter decomposes, the bacteria breaking down the dead algae consume oxygen and release carbon dioxide. That carbon dioxide makes the seawater more acidic, and juvenile clams have a harder time building their shells.
Maine landings of the clams brought in almost $20 million in 2014, according to the Department of Marine Resources. Trying to slow the rate of acidification will be vital to the health of the industry.
"We have a lot of work to do," the report concluded.
'The worst' years
In an interview Monday, John Lemont, a commercial harvester in Brunswick, said "the last couple of years have been the worst."
He said he suspects warmer water and invasive green crabs as some of the biggest contributors to the decline, but he sees the effects of acidic water on young clams' shells as well.
"(Acid) tends to eat the shell ... as they start developing," he said.
Some towns are trying to counter the detrimental effects of acidic seawater by "buffering" clam flats with pounds of crushed clam shells. The hope is that adding more calcium carbonate to the ecosystem will reduce the impact of the acidic water in the mud flats.
Experiments with "shell hash" in Cumberland, Freeport, and Brunswick have shown varying degrees of success. Brunswick Harbormaster Dan Devereaux said that strategy has helped stabilize clam beds about half of the time.
FOCB offered suggestions for what citizens can do to help slow the rate of acidification in the bay. The report said limiting fertilizer use on lawns and in gardens, and pumping out boat sewage at designated facilities, can help reduce nitrogen runoff.
"Fortunately, unlike some environmental problems," the study found, "there are many things each of us can do to tackle threats to the health of Casco Bay."

Outdoors in Maine: Escaping winter with stone crabs

Abstract: The author is editor of the Northwoods Sporting Journal. He is also a Maine Guide, co-host of a weekly radio program "Maine Outdoors" heard Sundays at 7 p.m. on The Voice of Maine News-Talk Network (WVOM-FM 103.9, WQVM-FM 101.3) and former information officer for the Maine Dept. of Fish and Wildlife. His e-mail address is vpaulr@tds.net . He has two books "A Maine Deer Hunter's Logbook" and his latest, "Backtrack." Online information is available at www.maineoutdoorpublications.com. The harvest works like this: You reach in the trap and gingerly grab the crab from behind, getting a firm grip on the inside of each claw (chelae). The claw, to be legal, must measure 2.75 inches from the joint to the black tip of the claw. A legal claw is taken by breaking it off where it meets the crab's main shell. The clawless crab is then returned to the water. If the claw is removed properly, the crab has about a 50 percent chance of survival. (Crabs sometimes escape predators by sacrificing a claw). A stone crab's principal predators are sea turtles, groupers and humans.

Full text:   In the Florida Keys, comfortably removed from one of the worst winters New England has known, there are plenty of diversions beyond watching the weather channel and enjoying the plentiful sun-drenched days, ocean breezes and soaring birds. My son-in-law, Jacques, and I have taken up stone crabbing.
Stone crabs are a delicacy -- an expensive delicacy. The average Joe and Jane doesn't indulge in stone crabs regularly. Crab prices vary from $25 a pound and up. During the many years that we have been coming to the Keys, Diane and I had, until recently, dined on stone crabs just once. Feeling flush a few years back, we bought a couple of pounds of claws, some special dip, and sat out back of our trailer home and pounded shells and picked sumptuous crab meat to our hearts' delight.
Florida residents are allowed to put out five recreational stone crab traps. A trap is a one-and-a-half by one-and-a-half foot black, plastic, vented box. It is weighted at the bottom with a thin layer of concrete. The box has a cover, and an entry hole for the crab. Attached to the trap is about 15 feet of nylon rope and a Styrofoam buoy, painted up in a personalized color of choice.
Frozen pig's feet are purchased locally and used as bait. One pig's foot is good for about a week or so.
Jacques' traps are all in the Florida Back Bay in about 6 feet or less of water, not far from the marina where he keeps his boat. All of the bait sites are waypointed on the boat GPS. We try to check the traps about every seven days. As you might guess, some days are better than others. A good day is seven or eight stone crab claws in the cooler.
In the scheme of things, stone crabs have quite a lineage. Their ancestors date back three million years. They feed on oysters, other mollusks and sea grass. How can a stone crab break open an oyster? Get your pinky nipped by one of these vice-grip pincers and you'll understand how.
The harvest works like this: You reach in the trap and gingerly grab the crab from behind, getting a firm grip on the inside of each claw (chelae). The claw, to be legal, must measure 2.75 inches from the joint to the black tip of the claw. A legal claw is taken by breaking it off where it meets the crab's main shell. The clawless crab is then returned to the water. If the claw is removed properly, the crab has about a 50 percent chance of survival. (Crabs sometimes escape predators by sacrificing a claw). A stone crab's principal predators are sea turtles, groupers and humans.
Commercial crabbing, like lobstering in Maine, is big business in south Florida. The Back Bay area is peppered with crab trap buoys, which can be a navigational challenge at times to boaters. I read about one commercial crabber who tends 600 traps a day.
One part of the crabbing regulation that surprises me is that you are allowed to take both claws. Studies have shown that a one-clawed crab has a considerably higher survival rate than a clawless one. In day-to-day crabbing, it is common to find a crab with only one legal claw; perhaps this explains the rationale behind the regulation.
Most reports indicate that the Florida crabbing industry is being managed in a responsible and sustainable way.
When you buy stone crabs, the claws come in four sizes: medium, large, jumbo, and colossal. As table fare, and as one of nature's critters, the stone crab is special. Now that we are gathering our own, they taste even better.

Abstract: "We don't have a magic bullet to reverse the effects of ocean acidification and stop the world from pumping out so much carbon dioxide," [Mick Devin] said. "But there are things we can do locally." The changing ocean chemistry can have "potentially devastating ramifications for all ocean life," including key commercial species, according to NOAA. Maine's ocean acidification panel, which includes scientists, fishermen and legislators, issued its report in January. It produced a host of bills, including one that calls for the state to borrow $3 million so scientists can collect data about increasing ocean acidity along the Maine coast and its impact on key commercial species, such as lobster and clams. The "most alarming" finding is "how much we do not know about ocean acidification and how it will affect Maine's commercially important species," the report said.

Full text:   PORTLAND (AP) -- A group of state legislators in New England want to form a multi-state pact to counter increasing ocean acidity along the East Coast, a problem they believe will endanger multi-million dollar fishing industries if left unchecked.
The legislators' effort faces numerous hurdles: They are in the early stages of fostering cooperation between many layers of government, hope to push for potentially expensive research and mitigation projects, and want to use state laws to tackle a problem scientists say is the product of global environmental trends.
But the legislators believe they can gain a bigger voice at the federal and international levels by banding together, said Mick Devin, a Maine representative who has advocated for ocean research in his home state. The states can also push for research to determine the impact that local factors such as nutrient loading and fertilizer runoff have on ocean acidification and advocate for new controls, he said.
"We don't have a magic bullet to reverse the effects of ocean acidification and stop the world from pumping out so much carbon dioxide," Devin said. "But there are things we can do locally."
The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration says the growing acidity of worldwide oceans is tied to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, and they attribute the growth to fossil fuel burning and land use changes. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide increased from 280 parts per million to over 394 parts per million over the past 250 years, according to NOAA.
Carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean, and when it mixes with seawater it reduces the availability of carbonate ions, scientists at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution said. Those ions are critical for marine life such as shellfish, coral and plankton to grow their shells.
The changing ocean chemistry can have "potentially devastating ramifications for all ocean life," including key commercial species, according to NOAA.
The New England states are following a model set by Maine, which commissioned a panel to spend months studying scientific research about ocean acidification and its potential impacts on coastal industries. Legislators in Rhode Island and Massachusetts are working on bills to create similar panels. A similar bill was shot down in committee in the New Hampshire legislature but will likely be back in 2016, said Rep. David Borden, who sponsored the bill.
Massachusetts Rep. Tim Madden, who introduced a bill in his state in January, said one of the goals of the effort is to get policy makers talking about ocean acidification, which some call the "evil twin" of global warming.
"I don't think it has been talked about in the commonwealth until recently," he said.
Hauke Kite-Powell, a research specialist in the Marine Policy Center at Woods Hole, said there is little the state legislators can do to curb carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which is a main driver of ocean acidification. But state officials do have the ability to regulate what kinds of nutrients flow into coastal oceans, which also affects pH levels.
"The coastal oceans, where shellfish farming takes place and where there's a lot of economically important biological life, the pH conditions are influenced strongly by the things that flow in from the land," he said.
Maine's ocean acidification panel, which includes scientists, fishermen and legislators, issued its report in January. It produced a host of bills, including one that calls for the state to borrow $3 million so scientists can collect data about increasing ocean acidity along the Maine coast and its impact on key commercial species, such as lobster and clams. The "most alarming" finding is "how much we do not know about ocean acidification and how it will affect Maine's commercially important species," the report said.
Devin said the legislators hope to convince other coastal states and Canadian provinces to commit to studying ocean acidification. Farther down the coast, Maryland also passed legislation last year calling for a study of the effects of ocean acidification on state waters. Washington also became the first West Coast state to take similar action last year.
President Barack Obama's fiscal 2016 budget proposal included $30 million for NOAA to study ocean acidification, a major bump from previous years.

Abstract: "Being nominated for a James Beard Award is the highest accolade we could get in our profession," Paige Gould, who runs Central Provisions with her chef husband Chris Gould, a Bethel native, said. "I am fairly overwhelmed." To Paige Gould, "part of a good restaurant is the owner's presence. Me and my husband try our best to be present all the time. He didn't take any days off until the fall," she said, adding that the restaurant's "fantastic management crew" is the key to their rapid rise. Cara Stadler received the rising chef of the year nod for Tao Yuan in Brunswick. The 27-year-old, whose Bao Bao Dumpling House opened in Portland in October, was a semifinalist in this category last year. This year she advanced a tier. "I am really excited more than anything," Stadler said. "Maine has been rocking it lately."

Full text:   The 25th annual James Beard Foundation Award nominees were announced Tuesday morning on Twitter. Portland came up big. Four of the 10 Maine semifinalists advanced to the next round in the Oscars of the food world. All have restaurants in Portland.
Central Provisions on Fore Street was nominated for best new restaurant in the nation.
The year-old newcomer has been wowing diners with fresh fish and a modern approach to small plates since last February.
"Being nominated for a James Beard Award is the highest accolade we could get in our profession," Paige Gould, who runs Central Provisions with her chef husband Chris Gould, a Bethel native, said. "I am fairly overwhelmed."
The pair have ascended fast in food city. The 31-year-olds met at Clio in Boston, where they trained under top chef Ken Oringer. Central Provisions, which has a waitlist even during the lean season, vies for top spot in the country among establishments in much larger cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Minneapolis.
The award is bestowed upon a restaurant that opened in 2014, which "displays excellence in food, beverage, and service and is likely to have a significant impact on the industry in years to come."
To Paige Gould, "part of a good restaurant is the owner's presence. Me and my husband try our best to be present all the time. He didn't take any days off until the fall," she said, adding that the restaurant's "fantastic management crew" is the key to their rapid rise.
In the coveted Best Chef Northeast, Masa Miyake of Miyake and Andrew Taylor and Mike Wiley of Eventide Oyster Co. are nominated. These Portland hotspots often are mentioned in national glossies for best oysters, lobster rolls and hip ambiance. Miyake's succulent sushi was recognized as one of the best in the country by Huffington Post in January.
Cara Stadler received the rising chef of the year nod for Tao Yuan in Brunswick. The 27-year-old, whose Bao Bao Dumpling House opened in Portland in October, was a semifinalist in this category last year. This year she advanced a tier. "I am really excited more than anything," Stadler said. "Maine has been rocking it lately."
Stadler, named one of the best new chefs in the U.S. by Food and Wine magazine last spring, stays humble. "There are four local finalists from Maine, incredibly talented people. It's an honor to be among them."
The reputation that Maine always lands last on lists has shifted. These culinary stars have stemmed the tide. And food lovers across the nation, who fuel the Beard Awards, have taken note.
"In order to vote, you have to eat at our restaurant, and we are in Mane," Paige Gould said. "The statistics are against us."
Not anymore.
Winners will be announced May 4 at a ceremony in Chicago.

Researcher aims to forecast Maine economic impact of red tide

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1660988525?accountid=10457

Abstract: Red tide in the Gulf of Maine is caused by a certain type of algae that "produces a highly potent toxin responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning in people and wildlife eating contaminated shellfish," the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration says on its website. It happens along the Gulf of Maine coast most years, causing varying degrees of disruption to the state's lucrative shellfish harvesting industry. "The tourists show up, they're buying clams, and the price is high," [Porter Hoagland] said. "If it's closed in January, there's almost no impact."

Full text:   ROCKPORT -- A marine researcher is working on a tool he says will allow the state to forecast the level of economic loss suffered by its shellfish industry due to a harmful algae bloom called red tide, which discolors water and makes mussels and clams unsafe for people to eat.
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution senior research specialist Porter Hoagland said the tool will help the state put a dollar amount on economic activity lost due to clam and mussel harvesting closures forced by red tide.
Red tide in the Gulf of Maine is caused by a certain type of algae that "produces a highly potent toxin responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning in people and wildlife eating contaminated shellfish," the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration says on its website. It happens along the Gulf of Maine coast most years, causing varying degrees of disruption to the state's lucrative shellfish harvesting industry.
Hoagland said he will use historical data about the production and value of shellfish at the local level to estimate the value of shellfish production with and without closures.
The value of shellfish also depends on the time of year, he said. For example, he estimated, a two-month summer shutdown of half of Maine's shellfish industry due to red tide likely would cost the state $7 million in economic activity.
Red tide closures limit the ability of fishermen to harvest softshell clams and blue mussels, popular food items that had a total value of more than $21 million last year, according to state data.
"The tourists show up, they're buying clams, and the price is high," Hoagland said. "If it's closed in January, there's almost no impact."
The tool is in development and could be available for use by the state this summer, Hoagland said.
The state contracted Woods Hole to do the work at a cost of $50,000 in 2012, state Department of Marine Resources spokesman Jeff Nichols said. The state is paying for the work with federal disaster relief funds, he said.
The ability to estimate economic losses due to red tide would help the state in applying to the federal government for disaster mitigation funds, Nichols said. The state's coast has "periodically experienced widespread, severe red tide blooms," with particularly bad years in 2005 and 2008, he said.
Some clam flats from South Berwick to Harpswell were shut down to softshell clam harvesting in June because of a red tide bloom.

Abstract: The Charcuterie Board includes two styles of homemade jerky, described by [Paul Olaf Lively] as "a maple Szechuan jerky and a black pepper fennel seed jerky made with filet mignon." It also features Lively's signature pate made with "black mission figs, ginger, pistachio and a foie gras mousse" and a pork and locally sourced ground sirloin pate made with cranberries infused with an 18-year-old Macallan scotch, smoked bourbon apples and pecans, wrapped in local organic bacon. The board includes house-made boursin cheese, a peach gastric and a sprinkle of scotch-infused cranberries -- "a little sweet and sour to compliment the savory of the meats," Lively says. [Susi-Q Beck] is also partial to the Grand Trunk pork. "Its Berkshire pork medallions wrapped in bacon with a light and airy, sweet and spicy sauce" which, she says, brings "it all together to give you something different than what you thought." "It's pretty," she says, "and it's the whole experience!" [Ileshea Stowe]'s favorites include the Lincoln Street poutine, the Southern Rail and the Southern Pacific Double Stack - described on the menu as an "open-face chickpea-beet patty, sprouts, on a house-made savory shortbread." According to Beck, the Double Stack is served on "an incredibly beautiful bread, like a pink peppercorn crust . . . a light but satisfying organic, vegan dish." It's one of the "hidden gems on the menu, (especially) when you're the vegan at the table."

New Lewiston restaurant blends city's past with aware, upscale, inspired cuisine
The name of L-A's newest eatery, Rails, couldn't be more appropriate.
"It was an old railroad depot. . . . The end of the line for people who were coming to work," says Ileshea Stowe, director of operations and public relations at Rails, which opened recently at its remodeled location on Lincoln Street in Lewiston.
Most of those seeking employment in Lewiston and Auburn's textile mills and shoe factories in the 1800s and early 1900s were of French Canadian descent and arrived by rail. The new restaurant is located in what was known as Little Canada and was at one time referred to as the Ellis Island of Lewiston. "My family - on both sides -- came through here," says Stowe, whose parents own Rails.
For many years, the historic station stood empty. "When we got involved, it was a disaster," says Stowe, "but it was a disaster with good bones and a great history."
As renovations moved full steam ahead, Stowe was surprised by the passion that locals had for the structure, and how many came forward to contribute to the making of Rails. Owner Claire Dick came up with the name, calling it Rails because of its history, its architecture and the site-specific artifacts that survived the years, including the now ornamental rails that run through the dooryard.
The "rail car seats" running down the center of the dining room, constructed locally by McIntosh & Tuttle, are thoughtfully reminiscent of seats in yesteryear's rail stations. Other details of the decor include pews and kneeling benches from St. Patrick's Cathedral, as well as train tracks used as foot rests in Rails' "Bar Car" area.
An antique organ, repurposed as the hostess desk, is on loan from the Franco Center, and other historical pieces such as trunks and photographs have been donated by members of the community, including antique time charts that were found behind old pictures in frames and scale-model railroad cars and tracks that were rescued from a local dump.
In her life pre-Rails, Stowe was a teacher. She still owns a small farm where she raises poultry, pigs, sheep and a goat. Stowe became interested in food preparation because of allergies and because of her passion for "interesting and innovative food," she says, adding, "People who have food issues can always come in here to eat." Even the poutine, a local favorite, is "gluten free and (made with) goat cheese, so most people who are allergic to dairy can still have it."
Stowe says she also wanted to create a "melding of community, history and fun." So it's no surprise the restaurant's tag line, "Local-motive dining," which was coined by Rails kitchen Manager Susi-Q Beck, arose organically.
"We're considerately and thoughtfully sourcing our product, and giving a lot of thought to creating dishes that are unique but traditional," says Stowe. She notes that Rails' Chef Paul Olaf Lively "excels at pairing things that you wouldn't necessarily think might go together."
The "Chef Paul experience is a combination of sweet and savory, using infusing - a steeping of flavors - to create the overall experience," explains Lively. A generous portion of Lively's inspiration comes from the immigrants who passed through the doors when Rails was the train station, bringing together the flavors of French Arcadia, Cajun cuisine and even Japanese.
On the appetizer menu, Chef Paul's Charcuterie Board -- served on wooden cutting boards made by McIntosh & Tuttle -- is laden with house-made pates and meats, as well as freshly baked breads and other enticements, such as "candied rainbow chard stems," the latter an example of Lively's "don't throw anything away" philosophy.
The Charcuterie Board includes two styles of homemade jerky, described by Lively as "a maple Szechuan jerky and a black pepper fennel seed jerky made with filet mignon." It also features Lively's signature pate made with "black mission figs, ginger, pistachio and a foie gras mousse" and a pork and locally sourced ground sirloin pate made with cranberries infused with an 18-year-old Macallan scotch, smoked bourbon apples and pecans, wrapped in local organic bacon. The board includes house-made boursin cheese, a peach gastric and a sprinkle of scotch-infused cranberries -- "a little sweet and sour to compliment the savory of the meats," Lively says.
Lively's signature dish is a tri-color beet terrine made with spiral, red and yellow beets and goat cheese, laced with vanilla bean and honey and pressed into a triangle. The terrine is left to set for a period of time to allow the color and flavor of the beets to infuse into the goat cheese. It is presented with a swoosh of beets roasted with sugar cane and coconut milk, a vinaigrette made with yellow beets, a roasted garlic and parsley oil, and local greens.
Rails' Chicken Scratch is, according to both Lively and Beck, "a takeoff on chicken and waffles . . . a southern thing." Using organic local chicken, the breast is "coated in spices and buttermilk, fried and served with a barbecue maple syrup." The dish includes organic corn cakes made with bacon butter, shoestring spiral sweet potatoes and a "sous vide" slow-cooked soft-poached egg.
Another signature dish is the Maine Line Surf & Turf. Braveheart beef, Lively explains, "is the Rolls Royce of filet mignon," and like the egg in Chicken Scratch, the meat is "sous vide and rolled in a blueberry and porcini mushroom dust, then finished by pan searing and served with a whole Maine blueberry demi glaze and a roasted garlic parsley butter," he says. It is presented with two exotic mushrooms and fresh mussels poached in a single-malt scotch and butter.
The Southern Rail is a smoky duck served under glass accompanied by a delicate sweet and savory Swiss chard anglais, roasted carrots, pink fingerling potatoes and local Brussels sprouts, as well as a cranberry and granny smith apple crisp with foie gras and a sweet potato crumble.
In the decade prior to his arrival at Rails' doorsteps, Lively was also an award-winning chocolatier. Rails' dessert menu includes his hand-rolled and dipped chocolate truffles. Using "16 different grades of chocolate from around the world (and) over 75 different infusions," including a single-malt scotch, Lively's menu offers creations that include the Porky Pig truffle - a truffle featuring the flavors of dark chocolate, bacon and butterscotch.
Susi-Q Beck came to Rails with a background in urban farming and community action with respect to food. Formerly a "personal and natural chef," Beck specializes in cooking "whole foods that are nutrient dense."
Beck's favorite menu items include the Grand Trunk Franco American salad, her own creation, which she describes as "a gluten-free and vegan meal salad with a mixture of beautiful seasonal greens, roasted, pickled and raw vegetables, and dried fruits." It is served with Rails' remoulade, a spicy French dressing, and offered with optional add-ins.
Beck is also partial to the Grand Trunk pork. "Its Berkshire pork medallions wrapped in bacon with a light and airy, sweet and spicy sauce" which, she says, brings "it all together to give you something different than what you thought." "It's pretty," she says, "and it's the whole experience!"
Stowe's favorites include the Lincoln Street poutine, the Southern Rail and the Southern Pacific Double Stack - described on the menu as an "open-face chickpea-beet patty, sprouts, on a house-made savory shortbread." According to Beck, the Double Stack is served on "an incredibly beautiful bread, like a pink peppercorn crust . . . a light but satisfying organic, vegan dish." It's one of the "hidden gems on the menu, (especially) when you're the vegan at the table."
According to Beck, now that the kitchen crew at Rails has been together for a few weeks, "we're gelling," making for a "happy kitchen-happy food" environment and product. She says she is "excited to be in Lewiston where soul food and home food is really up and coming."
"Lewiston is a great city with a great history, great people and beautiful architecture," says Stowe. "More than just that," she adds, "it's rewarding to create jobs and make a place where people want to come visit and eat, (and) be a part of the revitalization of the community."

Full text:   PORTLAND -- Qamar Ahmed looks into the eyes of her client, a mother of five whose years in Baghdad haunt her sleep.
She holds the woman's shoulder and speaks softly in Arabic as the two wait for an appointment at the Spurwink Psychiatric Clinic in downtown Portland, Maine. Ahmed, 31, is a professional interpreter, an occupation the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls one of the fastest-growing in the United States. Her first job on this bone-cold December morning is translating for Muna Rashed, 37, who left the chaos and violence of Iraq five years ago.
America is still that place where, when you have to go somewhere, the door opens, and not just in New York, Los Angeles or San Antonio. Last fiscal year, 350 refugees came directly to Maine from overseas, up from 60 five years ago, drawn to the northern New England state for its quietude and good schools. Most are from Iraq and Somalia and speak little or no English.
Ahmed, who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. 15 years ago, now spends her days translating for those newer arrivals from the Muslim world.
"I am them," Ahmed says of her clients in syntax that's perfect except for the occasional omission of the definite article. "When you are interpreter, you are the person who is talking. You are them."
She stands just over five feet tall, and this morning wears a black pantsuit and gold jewelry around both wrists. Her round face is framed by a black, pink and gold hijab, the Muslim headdress. She is Sunni. She believes God answers her prayers and that the no-drink, no-smoke, no-sex-before-marriage precepts of her faith are there for good reason.
Through Ahmed, her client Rashed says she saw three in-laws killed in the brutal chaos of her city. She describes the bullet holes that riddled the house she left behind. Her sisters are still there and she's worried. Rashed says she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Of the hundreds of appointments Ahmed makes every year wherever language is a road block -- from parent-teacher conferences to job interviews -- doing the translating in a psychiatric session accounts for half.
"Back home, we don't believe in psychiatrists," she says. "Now people are realizing: Why should I hide my problems. If I hide problems, it's going to destroy me."
Refugees are not illegal immigrants. They are credentialed by the United Nations as people fleeing persecution. The State Department wants them self-sufficient in 90 to 180 days. They can apply to be citizens after five years. Still, their presence fuels the national controversy that heated up this year as President Barack Obama tried to overhaul the immigration system, namely, that new arrivals put an untenable strain on government services. Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, tried but failed this year to bar immigrants and asylum seekers from getting state assistance.
No one talks about cutting interpreters. Those who rely on their services say life would be messier and more dangerous without them.
They help get to the bottom of serious crime, including murder, according to Portland Police Lt. James Sweatt, head of detectives who use interpreters. Last year a suspect in the sexual assault of a young child was indicted only after a Spanish-speaking interpreter was brought in. That case is still making its way through the court, he said.
Ashley Storrow of Catholic Charities Maine, the federally- designated gatekeeper for all Maine's refugees, says her staff regularly hears horror stories when no interpreter is present: a woman involuntarily committed to a mental institution with no understanding of why she was there, another undergoing a painful biopsy without medication because she didn't know how to ask.
In November, Ahmed was driving to a McDonald's with her husband and three sons, 10, 7 and 4, when they came upon a car accident. Her husband recognized one driver as a co-worker, an Iraqi who spoke no English. Ahmed stayed with him for four hours from crash scene to hospital, where he was finally released with minor injuries.
"That felt so good seeing somebody needed your help," she said.
She and her husband, Liban Ayanle, are a team, she says. He's the housekeeping manager at the Regency Hotel in the cobblestoned Old Port section of Portland where tourists inhale oysters and microbrews and watch the fishermen come in. He helps with the housework and spends his days off at their home at the end of a quiet street watching their sons while Ahmed works.
This Muslim woman who starts her day by dropping off the boys at school is self-employed, keeping an average of five appointments a day, five days a week. She's paid $20 an hour and bills six agencies for her services, jotting down all appointments and hours worked in a large calendar book. Her chief source is Catholic Charities, whose staff picks up new arrivals at the Portland airport, drives them to housing and helps get them started on the package of benefits coming their way, including $25 in pocket cash for each.
Ahmed could enter the picture from the start, at the airport. Since assignments are made randomly, clients are always changing and rarely does she know if her presence makes a difference. An exception came this summer when she went with an Iraqi refugee to a job interview at Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Visiting a friend some time later, she saw the man was there. He came running over, thanking her for the help in landing his job.
"Wow, Qamar," she said to herself. "I'm making a difference."
Of the 108 interpreters Catholic Charities Maine uses, she is among its busiest, says Storrow, the assistant program director and Ahmed's supervisor.
Like many of the others, Ahmed has been warned not to get too close to her clients lest she become a friend who might sugarcoat a bad diagnosis or negative feedback at a job interview.
"They have to be like a telephone," Storrow said, "and repeat exactly what they hear."
Ahmed's life story doesn't make neutrality easy.
As a young child in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, she watched a bomb tear off the back of her house. Her parents packed up the 10 children (she's eighth) and headed for Yemen, where Ahmed lived for 10 years and learned Arabic. In 1999, the family came to Alexandria, Virginia.
She was in her junior year of high school there when a fellow Somali told her about a brother living in Maine. He came to visit and, in September 2002, they married. She was 19. He was 25.
Ahmed's first year in Maine was difficult. Her husband worked long hours. Her English was poor and she had no friends as she completed her senior year at Portland's high school.
With her English improved and after a stint at Wal-Mart, she tried her hand at interpreting. She liked it. She went through 60 hours of training at a local community college, including the study of medical terminology so she could handle doctor visits.
When Ahmed and her client emerge from their recent psychiatric appointment, Rashed's face is flushed. She looks exhausted.
Ahmed says Rashed cried when asked about sleep. She's up at 3:30 every morning. Adjustments are made to the medication and a follow-up appointment is scheduled.
Ahmed follows her client to the street. She bids adieu -- "ma'a salama" -- careful not to get too close but ever mindful of how much they share.

Full text:   LEWISTON -- New data from the U.S. Census Bureau show exports of Maine goods to other countries declined by 12 percent from 2012 to 2013.
The data, released for all 50 states Thursday, show Maine exported about $2.68 billion worth of goods in 2013, a decline of $370 million from $3.05 billion in 2012.
Exports to Canada, the state's top trading partner, were up by 3.5 percent, an increase of $46 million for a total of $1.4 billion, but exports to China -- a country state officials have often cited as having a large export growth potential -- was down by 10 percent.
But some of the decline is the result of the way one Maine semiconductor maker is reporting its exports, said Janine Bisaillon-Cary, president of the Maine International Trade Center and state director for international trade.
"A lot of our dip in exports from 2012 to 2013 was due to the semiconductor industry where one of the groups has made internal changes and are not reporting their exports from Maine, but are reporting them from the port of export," Bisaillon-Cary wrote in a message to the Sun Journal.
Exports of the state's top 25 commodities, including potatoes, raw lumber and lobsters, were down overall by about 10 percent, according to the Census Bureau data.
With two mills closing during the reporting period, it was not surprising that exports of Maine-made paper products were down by about 24 percent, a decrease of $20 million. But paper sector exports were down a whopping 50 percent from 2010, from $124 million to $63 million.
Also showing a sharp decline was the export of civilian aircraft, engines and parts down to $159 million in 2013 from $245 million in 2012.
Another sector that showed a dramatic decline was electronic integrated circuits, which went from $357 million in 2012 to $47 million in 2013.
Whole, raw potato exports were down by 7 percent and sea urchin exports were down 6 percent.
On the bright side, the export of lobsters, the state's top export commodity, was up 5.3 percent, an increase of about $12 million from 2012.
Also up were exports of farmed salmon and exports of fresh blueberries and cranberries.
State political leaders said the data were interesting but not terribly surprising.
Maine House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, said he and other leaders were eager to see 2014 data because of signs that the Chinese economy was "ramping up again."
He said signs on some food exports, particularly fish and shellfish, were hopeful but the state should be concerned about produce exports, especially potatoes, which were showing a downward slide.
"I think as a whole we need to come up with a specific strategy in Maine to look at everything we are manufacturing and making sure that people around the world know it's the utmost quality and the highest standards," McCabe said.
He said a bigger focus on promoting Maine-grown food should be in play as well.
"We need to make sure that people know we have high-quality food and safe food," McCabe said. "We need to work to get that word out."

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- Just a day after being sworn into office, a trio of state lawmakers, two Democrats and one Republican, will head to Taiwan on a trade mission.
State Sens. John Patrick, D-Rumford, and Brian Langley, R-Ellsworth, along with state Rep. Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, will depart for the seven-day trip, paid for by the Taiwanese government, on Thursday. The men will be sworn in as lawmakers Wednesday -- all three were re-elected in November.
Patrick serves on the Legislature's Labor, Commerce, Research and Economic Development Committee. McCabe is the incoming House majority leader.
Patrick said Monday that he hopes to gain information that could help Maine's paper industry, which has seen two mills close in recent months, putting hundreds of workers out of jobs.
Patrick is a journeyman mechanic who has worked for 32 years at the NewPage mill in Rumford, according to his legislative profile.
Skowhegan, McCabe's town, is the home of Sappi Fine Paper North America's Somerset Mill. McCabe is the incoming House majority leader.
Langley is a retired culinary arts teacher and owns and operates a lobster restaurant in Ellsworth.
McCabe said Tuesday that the trip is an annual journey made by a group of lawmakers from the New England states. He said the trip would include a large number of "meet-and-greet" events.
He said the paper industry may come up, but there was no specific agenda around papermaking.
"It's more to just help develop connections and ties for every kind of economic development," McCabe said.
Langley, who has been the lead Senate Republican on the Legislature's Education Committee, is likely to chair the committee when Republicans take the majority in the Senate starting Wednesday.
He said he was interested in learning more about Taiwan's education system, in which students outperform U.S. students academically.
"I always like to see if there is something useful we can take back and apply here in Maine," Langley said.
Langley has traveled in Asia previously, most recently to Japan. He said he's looking forward to the time outside the Legislature with his Democratic colleagues.
While they are from different parties, he said he's worked well with Patrick and McCabe in the past and was looking forward to sharing some of Taiwan's cuisine with his colleagues from Maine.
A chef by training, Langley quipped, "I'm going to enjoy the look on Sen. Patrick's face when I slide a piece of raw fish across the table towards him."
He said he usually spends time on his travels to talk up Maine lobster but also to learn what the state and industry need to do to better market the state's iconic shellfish to the rest of the world.
"I like to hear from them what they need in order to better help us on the marketing end of things here," Langley said.
He said the itinerary for the trip includes specific visits that incorporate the various interests of all lawmakers on the trip in hopes of strengthening economic ties between Taiwan and New England.
The trip is sponsored by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Boston. The lawmakers will return to the United States on Dec. 12.

Full text:   By next summer, Maine Coast Sea Vegetables plans to move from Franklin to Ellsworth, into twice the space with better access to transportation.
Gabor Degre/Bangor Daily News
Maine Coast Sea Vegetables sells certified organic seaweed and seaweed products such as these organic energy bars.
Gabor Degre/Bangor Daily News
Kelp is cut to length before packaging at the Maine Coast Sea Vegetables. The companty will relocate from Franklin to Hancock next year. They sell certified organic seaweed and seaweed products.
Its products are sold under the brands Kelp Krunch, Sea Seasonings, Dulse and others. Its sheets of nori are used as wraps for sushi and California rolls.
With its products in Whole Foods, small chains and independent health food stores, Amazon and its own site (seaveg.com), the company's sales are booming -- and it has outgrown its existing patchwork production plant, which General Manager Seraphina Erhart calls "a rabbit warren."
"We're bursting at the seams," Erhart said during a recent tour of the facility.
Erhart is the daughter of Shep and Linnette Erhart, who launched the business out of their home in 1971 to process edible seaweed. They processed 200 pounds of edible sea vegetables the first year. Maine Coast Sea Vegetables moved into its current building, a former production facility for a salmon farm, in 1993.
Over the years, the company added onto the building numerous times to accommodate processing, product development, storage and shipping. Today, it's easy to get lost among ramps and stairs leading to multiple levels, out-of-the-way warehouses and backyard trailers.
That will change next summer, when the company moves within Hancock County to its new facility in Ellsworth, 12 miles from the current site. Construction is underway, and move-in will take place after the plant is equipped and certified organic.
It is expected everyone on the staff of 19 will stay on. The new space will accommodate up to 25 workers.
Shep Erhart credits Seraphina Erhart, who was hired four years ago, with bringing new energy to help fulfill his dream of having a custom-built facility that will include a research and development kitchen to allow cooks to test recipes and give public demonstrations.
The lobby will be devoted to public outreach. The owners hope to educate students and the general public about sea vegetables, including nutritional information and recipes. A sliding wall between the kitchen and a conference room will allow the space to become a classroom.
At 17,600 square feet, nearly twice the size of the current plant, the $1.5 million facility will have a better layout for storing raw ingredients, processing, packaging and shipping. The company got bank and Small Business Administration loans to finance the project.
"We built it for 10 years out, so yes, we will grow," said Shep Erhart. "We're not saying exactly how fast or what's next, but we're saying we need more space and we'd like to put new product on line."
The company contracts with more than 50 harvesters. About 100,000 pounds are harvested along the coast from Bar Harbor to Eastport, but also from the waters around Grand Manan Island in New Brunswick. The harvest stretches from early April to late October.
About 60 percent of the harvest is dulse, which has a rich red color and is soft and chewy. It's often used in soups and is primarily found around Grand Manan.
Other sea edibles include alaria, which favors turbulent areas and can be hard to reach, sugar kelp, laver, sea lettuce, bladderwrack, rockweed and Irish moss. All of those products are native to Maine.
Maine Coast Sea also buys 100,000 pounds of sea vegetables each year from other North Atlantic wholesalers, mainly in Iceland.
Like land vegetables, some seaweeds taste better raw, others cooked. Some are ground as condiments or for use as nutritional supplements in capsule form. Seraphina Erhart said the food is becoming more popular.
"Everyone knows what a sushi roll is now," Erhart said. "That was not the case 20 years ago."
Most of the world's seaweed harvest is used for fertilizer, animal feed and extracts such as carageenan, a thickener.
According to Maine Sea Grant at the University of Maine, one of 33 NOAA Sea Grant programs, there are more than 250 species of sea vegetables in the Gulf of Maine. Most are edible, although not necessarily tasty. Fewer than a dozen are commercially harvested.
Rockweed has comprised over 95 percent of Maine's seaweed landings by weight over the past five years. An estimated 16.7 million pounds of rockweed was harvested in 2013, compared with 468,900 pounds of other seaweeds.
Most of it is processed into two general product categories, nutritional supplements for animals and people, and concentrated fertilizers. With a total estimated value of $20 million per year, rockweed is one of Maine's most valuable marine resources. It also is an essential component of Maine's intertidal zone, providing food, shelter and spawning habitat for a variety of small marine organisms.
For all seaweeds, the Department of Marine Resources issues about 100 harvester licenses annually. It remains a small industry, employing a total of 115 workers on the waterfront and in plants. The Department of Marine Resources and industry are working on a management plan to assure rockweed is harvested sustainably into the future.
Regulations regarding sustainability are relatively minimal, especially compared to fisheries. But Shep Erhart said he requires his independent contractors to limit their harvest to 30 percent to 50 percent of a bed, depending on the species, a percentage he's observed as sustainable over his 43 years in the industry.
While the industry remains small, Maine Coast Sea Vegetables is seeing increased demand. Originally, the products appealed to natural foods enthusiasts and consumers on macrobiotic diets. Today, the vegetables are touted for their nutritional value, including vitamins, calcium, and iron.
There are efforts to increase the amount of farmed, cultivated seaweed, prompted in part by two 2011 disasters.
Japan's March 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident stirred fears of radioactive seafood products on the Pacific coast and created demand for Atlantic seaweed and seafood.
"Everyone was scared, so they were looking for seaweed they felt they could trust out of the Atlantic," said Seraphina Erhart. "There was also a group of people who wanted to buy up as much as they could that had been harvested before Fukushima. So we did three months of sales in six weeks."
Then, in August 2011, Hurricane Irene washed seaweed out to sea, reducing the year's harvest.
"So we felt an increased demand on our supply and had less supply than ever," Seraphina Erhart said. "That was around the time Shep started saying we needed to come up with new products and have more secondary products. We looked around and said, 'Where and how are we going to accomplish that in this facility?' The combination of all that happening, within a year, was a huge push for both the new facility and for farming. And it seemed we couldn't do one without the other."
The Erharts concluded they needed greater capacity to process farmed seaweed.
"The wild stuff trickles in over the course of a season, but a farm is more likely to produce a huge amount in a short period of time," Erhart said.
In 2013, with a $19,842 grant from the Maine Technology Institute, Shep Erhart began working with the University of Maine's Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research in Franklin and the Sea Grant Cooperative Extension to develop seeded nets and ropes for aquaculture production.
Elsewhere, research and practice are coming together. Sea Grant's research is advancing seaweed farming by building on research conducted by University of Maine professor Susan Brawley.
From Portland, Ocean Approved LLC, founded by Tollef Olson in 2006, is farming open-ocean sugar kelp. At a 35-acre site off Sorrento, in Frenchman's Bay, Sea Grant marine extension agent Sarah Redmond is leading a collaboration that includes Shep Erhart and lobster fisherman James West. Redmond has been working with Brawley in the lab and setting up trials with shellfish farmers interested in seeding seaweed around existing harvest sites as a supplemental crop.
"There's a lot of momentum, as a new industry," Redmond said. "Ocean Approved is at the commercial scale and produce their own seed. Others are figuring out how to culture it. Every site is different and every situation is different, and none of that infrastructure has been established."
Erhart said it will be five years before he gets a commercially viable crop.
"The good news is, it's happening successfully elsewhere in the North Atlantic. We just have to figure out this particular bay and our particular parameters," he added.
It could be that climate change, ocean acidification and invasive species will make farming an increasingly important part of the industry, he said.
"Climate change is happening in the seaweed kingdom as well as everywhere else on the planet," Erhart said. "This year, we got enough wild-harvested seaweed, not as much as we did last year -- and not more. So we may be at the threshold of sustainable harvest of the wild crop. It makes sense -- if we're going to meet increasing demand -- that we cultivate it."
At the same time, seaweeds are adapters.
"They've been through a bunch of ice ages," he said. "They're millions of years old. They've survived a lot of changes. And so will we."

With a sigh for the days that are gone, will many an old resident of Lewiston and Auburn learn of the death of Samuel Hibbert of Lewiston, a pioneer restaurant-keeper, a square man, a true friend and a tender heart. Thirty-five years ago, when this writer came to Lewiston, "Sam" Hibbert was working in his brother's oyster-house in a little building on Lisbon street, north of Bicknell & Neal's clothing store, which is now Cronin & Root's. Over the door was the sign "Jack Hibbert's." Here was the social centre of the Club of Big Eats. Anyone who wanted a square meal went to Jack Hibbert's. Fat custard pies; big mounds of cold fried sausages; huge plates of crisp brown slices of calf's liver and bacon; oyster fancy roasts and last, but not least, the justly celebrated steamed oysters on the shell.
50 years ago, 1964
Twenty-one year old Victor Dufault of the Hotel Road, Auburn, was among the lucky hunters this past weekend who did not come home empty-handed. Dufault dropped a 73-pound "albino" deer -- a rather uncommon species -- while hunting with three companions in the Moosehead region last Saturday.

Abstract: The term "diner" originates from the phrase "dining car" because early diners were patterned after railroad dining cars. Decommissioned railroad cars and trolleys were sometimes converted into diners by individuals who couldn't afford to purchase a newly manufactured one. The diner's standard dinner menu includes classic diner offerings, such as meatloaf, macaroni and cheese, baked beans with franks, grilled ham, grilled pork chops, fried chicken, liver and onions, fried ham, fried haddock, Maine fried oysters, fried clams, fried seafood platter, chicken salad plate and tuna salad plate. Hot sandwiches (including a vegetarian sandwich made with grilled vegetables and herbed goat cheese), cold sandwiches, wraps, a variety of salads and homemade soups round out the menu. There's no overlooking the "caboose" at the end of a meal at A1 Diner. The restaurant's homemade desserts are also favorites among customers near and far. They can include black mocha cake, orange layer cake, orange chocolate bread pudding, chocolate chip cookie cheesecake, gingerbread with lemon sauce, cream cheese brownies, toffee chocolate chip cookies and berry slump.

Full text:   One of Gardiner's most frequented and perhaps oldest restaurant is A1 Diner, located at 3 Bridge St. The diner itself is one of the original lunch car diners constructed in Worcester, Mass., back when diners were just becoming popular. It has six booths and 14 stools at the counter. The structure was transported to its current location shortly after it was constructed in 1946 and sits perched atop 15-foot stilts on the bridge.

The term "diner" originates from the phrase "dining car" because early diners were patterned after railroad dining cars. Decommissioned railroad cars and trolleys were sometimes converted into diners by individuals who couldn't afford to purchase a newly manufactured one.
Like most diners, A1 Diner offers its share of hamburgers, including a local burger made with organic, grass-fed beef topped with caramelized onions and Gruyere cheese; a north-of-the-border burger with Canadian bacon and cheddar cheese; a south-of-the-border burger with chili and pepper jack; a Mexican burger with salsa and pepper jack; a house-made turkey burger and more. All burgers are served with hand-cut French fries.
"We sell a ton of hamburgers," said co-owner Mike Giberson.
Giberson and business partner Neil Andersen have owned the diner for the past 27 years. Giberson said he does much of the cooking himself, but other cooks help prepare food throughout the week.
"I like to keep it interesting," said Giberson. "We have our standard favorites over and over, but I also like to try new recipes."
According to Giberson, the diner offers a dozen specials, three soups, one type of chili and a dozen different desserts every day (except Sunday) in addition to the standard menu items. The daily specials and desserts are posted on blackboards over the counter.
"We do a lot of ethnic cooking from different parts of the world," said Giberson. "We also do vegetarian cooking. Everything is house made."
Some of the specials at A1 Diner include Southwest pork taco with ground pork sausage and New Mexico hard chilis, with salsa and crema; New Orleans-style poor boys made with either fried oysters, fried pickles, chopped lettuce, sriracha sauce and mayonnaise on a baguette or fried clams with sriracha sauce, chopped lettuce, and mayonnaise on a baguette; fish tacos (made with haddock); and barbecue chicken tacos.
The diner's standard dinner menu includes classic diner offerings, such as meatloaf, macaroni and cheese, baked beans with franks, grilled ham, grilled pork chops, fried chicken, liver and onions, fried ham, fried haddock, Maine fried oysters, fried clams, fried seafood platter, chicken salad plate and tuna salad plate. Hot sandwiches (including a vegetarian sandwich made with grilled vegetables and herbed goat cheese), cold sandwiches, wraps, a variety of salads and homemade soups round out the menu.
Breakfast features a wide variety of typical morning fare, as well as the nontraditional, including Korean vegetable pancakes, lemon blueberry French toast and breakfast burritos. It was the diner's crispy blueberry pancakes, however, that recently earned it a spot on Thrillist Media Group's (www.thrillist.com) list of 21 Best Breakfast Spots in America. Brunch only is served on Sunday.
And there's no overlooking the "caboose" at the end of a meal at A1 Diner. The restaurant's homemade desserts are also favorites among customers near and far. They can include black mocha cake, orange layer cake, orange chocolate bread pudding, chocolate chip cookie cheesecake, gingerbread with lemon sauce, cream cheese brownies, toffee chocolate chip cookies and berry slump.

Abstract: The Atrium Art Gallery at the University of Southern Maine's Lewiston-Auburn Campus will present Secrets of the Sea, a multi-media exhibition of work inspired by marine plants and animals. The exhibit opens Thursday, Sept. 18, and continues through Nov. 22, 2014, and includes paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture and work in glass, metal, ceramic, stone, polymer, wood, fiber, and video by 23 artists. The exhibit includes several photographs by [Adam P. Summers], biologist at the Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics Lab at the University of Washington, accompanied by poems by Sierra Nelson. Summer uses marine specimens collected from fishing operations as the medium in an artistic project revealing the anatomical structure of sea creatures. The stained skeletal tissues are visible through the skin and flesh, exposing the biological innards as vibrantly colored matter. The photographs are not only mesmerizing on an aesthetic scale, but also give a rare glimpse of the underlying structure of the animal, visualizing their vertebrates, skeletons, and soft tissues.

Secrets of the Sea will open with a reception free and open to the public and cash bar from 5-7 p.m. The reception is concurrent with the Chamber Business After Hours and will feature gourmet delicacies of the sea including several made with seaweed from Ocean Approved, a kelp farm located in Casco Bay.
Highlights of the exhibit include Angler Fish, by the late Nathan Nicholls of Waldoboro, Maine. The 6-foot-long by 52-inch-high interpretation of an angler fish is welded with scrap metal including garden forks, rake tines, propane tank, bicycle seat, and pick heads.
Sea Horse is made with a snowmobile muffler, horse shoes, and other recognizable scrap metal items.
The exhibit includes several photographs by Adam P. Summers, biologist at the Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics Lab at the University of Washington, accompanied by poems by Sierra Nelson. Summer uses marine specimens collected from fishing operations as the medium in an artistic project revealing the anatomical structure of sea creatures. The stained skeletal tissues are visible through the skin and flesh, exposing the biological innards as vibrantly colored matter. The photographs are not only mesmerizing on an aesthetic scale, but also give a rare glimpse of the underlying structure of the animal, visualizing their vertebrates, skeletons, and soft tissues.
"In a desire to understand detail, you focus on how things work. These things are qualities that good poets and good biologists share," said Summers, who worked with poet Nelson to create poems for each image.
The exhibition features poetry from 14 writers in a chapbook titled "Poems For Tube-Snouts and Other Secrets of the Sea."
The exhibit includes a 1-1/2 minute stop-motion video by the artist PES. In 2013, the artist was nominated for an Academy Award for his brilliant, but brief, stop-action animated videos. Works in the exhibit were inspired by marine plants such as bladderwrack, invertebrate species including sea urchins, barnacles, mollusks, sea slugs, octopus, horseshoe crabs, and vertebrates such as fish, seals, and whales.
The Atrium Art Gallery is at 51 Westminster St. Gallery hours are Monday-Thursday, 8 a.m.-8 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m.; Saturday, 9 a.m.-3 p.m.; closed holidays. For more information, call 207-753-6500.

Abstract: While stationed in Honolulu, Hawaii, during the Korean War, he met the love of his life, Jeannine Orriere. Jeannine was from Paris, France, and left France after the second World War. On April 3, 1952, they married. Their five children and their spouses survive him: [Donald R. C. Morin] and his wife, Lisa, of Charlottesville, Va., Michelle Faulkner and her husband, Martin, of Pensadena, Md., Suzanne Kirk and her husband, Erik, of New Freedom, Pa., Denise Long and her husband, Glenn, of Jeffersonville, Ind., and Jacqueline Stoltz and her husband, Kent, of Pensacola, Fla. There are many grandchildren: Peyton and William Morin, Marty and Matthew Faulkner, Jeannine Remines, Stephenie (Long) Davis, William Long, Sam Long and Kyle (Stoltz) Randolph; and great-grandchildren, too: Katie, Alice and Charlie Remines, Tyler and Grace Randolph and Taylor (Faulkner) Reed and Sophia Faulkner. [Normand R. Morin] was athletic. He played fast pitch softball in the Army and amazed his kids with feats of daring from the high board at the pool at Fort Jay on Governors Island, N.Y. He was an excellent bowler and threw left-handed. In his 40s, he found his passion: golf. He taught himself to play golf and at one point, was a 5 or 6 handicap. He continued to play regularly year-round after he and Jeannine moved South, first to Myrtle Beach and then Pensacola, until this past summer's heat kept him away from the course. He was a regular member of Osceola Golf Club. He especially enjoyed golfing with his great buddy and best friend, Vincent "Vinny" Cadora.

Full text:   PENSACOLA, Fla. -- Cmd. Sgt. Maj. Normand R. Morin passed away unexpectedly at his home in Pensacola, Fla., on Wednesday, Sept. 3, in the loving company of his wife, Jeannine Morin. They were married on April 3, 1952, in Honolulu, Hawaii, and were blessed with 62 years of marriage.
Normand was born in Lewiston on Aug. 4, 1931. He was the son of Donat Joseph and Florence Cecelia Morin. He was proud of his French Canadian heritage; he spoke French before he spoke English. He was one of four children; he had a younger brother, Donald, and two younger sisters, Joanne and Jacqueline. His sister, Jackie Pelletier, who lives in Lewiston, survives him.
At the outbreak of the Korean War, he joined the U.S. Army. His youngest brother, Donald R. C. Morin, joined after him and was killed while on active duty in Korea on Feb. 3, 1952. Normand served for 30 years, retiring with the rank of command sergeant major on Feb. 28, 1979. He served his country proudly, including a tour of duty in Lebanon during the Suez Canal Conflict and in Ben Hoa, South Vietnam, from 1969 to 1970, including during the Tet Offensive.
While in the Army, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Columbia College in Columbia, Mo. He was the first in his family with a college degree. His service decorations included the National Defense Service Medal with the First Oak Leaf Cluster, Army Commendation Medal with the First Oak Leaf Cluster, Meritorious Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (Lebanon), Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm First Oak Leaf Cluster and Vietnam Service and Campaign medals. His last duty posting was the U.S. Army Northeast Region Recruiting Command at Fort George G. Meade, Md.
While stationed in Honolulu, Hawaii, during the Korean War, he met the love of his life, Jeannine Orriere. Jeannine was from Paris, France, and left France after the second World War. On April 3, 1952, they married. Their five children and their spouses survive him: Donald R. Morin and his wife, Lisa, of Charlottesville, Va., Michelle Faulkner and her husband, Martin, of Pensadena, Md., Suzanne Kirk and her husband, Erik, of New Freedom, Pa., Denise Long and her husband, Glenn, of Jeffersonville, Ind., and Jacqueline Stoltz and her husband, Kent, of Pensacola, Fla. There are many grandchildren: Peyton and William Morin, Marty and Matthew Faulkner, Jeannine Remines, Stephenie (Long) Davis, William Long, Sam Long and Kyle (Stoltz) Randolph; and great-grandchildren, too: Katie, Alice and Charlie Remines, Tyler and Grace Randolph and Taylor (Faulkner) Reed and Sophia Faulkner.
Normand was athletic. He played fast pitch softball in the Army and amazed his kids with feats of daring from the high board at the pool at Fort Jay on Governors Island, N.Y. He was an excellent bowler and threw left-handed. In his 40s, he found his passion: golf. He taught himself to play golf and at one point, was a 5 or 6 handicap. He continued to play regularly year-round after he and Jeannine moved South, first to Myrtle Beach and then Pensacola, until this past summer's heat kept him away from the course. He was a regular member of Osceola Golf Club. He especially enjoyed golfing with his great buddy and best friend, Vincent "Vinny" Cadora.
While a boy, his favorite uncle, Henry, taught him about horses and the track, which his favorite aunt, Alice, tolerated. He continued to play the horses throughout his life and his children remember their time with him at Aqueduct and other tracks in the Northeast. His favorite thoroughbred was Kelso.
He was a talented painter, as well. He loved to sketch and paint while he lived in New York City. One summer, he painted the New York skyline on the wall of his parents' small cottage on a pond outside Lewiston; it made the local paper.
We do not think there was anything he would not try or do. While in Hawaii, he took flying lessons and soloed over Oahu and around the Big Island. He even taught Arthur Murray dance lessons with Jeannine while they were in Hawaii. He was an extra, along with his whole unit, in the film, "From Here to Eternity." But above all, he loved people -- all kinds of people. He was willing to befriend anyone, anywhere.
Normand enjoyed life. One Christmas in the mid-1960s, he decorated his living room picture window with a Nativity scene and won a contest at Fort Jay. For the kids, he once dressed as a beatnik Santa Claus, with a beret and cigarette holder. He introduced his family to Chinese food and loved taking the family to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York after eating lunch in Chinatown. He loved oysters, lobster and scotch whiskey; no one could clean lobster better. He was a great husband, father and friend. We miss him and can only smile as we remember him. He will always be a part of our lives.

Abstract: "It sounds crazy, you're digging the clam twice," [Denis-Marc Nault] said. "You're doubling your effort, but it's a tool if they are backed into a corner." "It's really encouraging that the department is even opening that discussion," she said. "I wouldn't have thought that was something they'd be ready for." "Right now, it's pretty wide open," [Tim Johnson] said. "It's a huge opportunity."

New rules would let towns move shellfish from polluted waters
BRUNSWICK -- New state rules for municipal shellfish programs could help open denuded clam flats in intertidal communities struggling to overcome challenges to traditional harvesting.
One of the changes proposed by the Department of Marine Resources would allow towns to apply for permission to move shellfish from areas closed because of poor water quality and replant them in clean harvesting areas.
The amendment may give communities another option to help support wild shellfish harvesting, even though there are significant problems with implementing it, Denis-Marc Nault, a department scientist working on the new regulation, said.
"It sounds crazy, you're digging the clam twice," Nault said. "You're doubling your effort, but it's a tool if they are backed into a corner."
Nault was speaking following a sparsely attended public hearing on the rule Tuesday at the Town Office.
The department held hearings last week in Machias and Ellsworth. There is a Sept. 15 deadline for comments on the rule before department staff turn a draft over to the department's advisory council.
Under the proposal, towns that employ a qualified marine warden will be eligible to apply for a permit to transplant, or "relay" shellfish larger than seed from areas that are restricted to harvesting.
Some harvesting areas are restricted to harvesting because of the presence of pollution from overboard sewage discharge or stormwater runoff.
Although the areas may only be closed seasonally, they still provide a barrier to harvesters.
The new regulations would ease those restrictions, by allowing towns to get approval to move shellfish from restricted areas to open flats.
Towns will still not be allowed to transfer shellfish from areas where harvesting is strictly prohibited.
Harvesters would have to wait at least 60 days before harvesting the transplants, but if timed right, they could still gather fresh shellfish during the summer months, when prices are the highest.
Federal guidelines allow relaying shellfish, but until now Maine hasn't given towns the option.
At a meeting of Harpswell's Marine Resources Committee last week, committee members responded positively to the proposed rule.
The town has several possibly healthy clam flats that are closed off during the lucrative summer harvesting season, squeezing clammers into smaller areas with fewer clams.
According to Darcie Couture, a consultant working with the committee, deteriorating water quality in other harvesting areas in Harpswell means the rule change could hold promise for the town and other communities, particularly if the Department of Marine Resources decides to allow towns to reduce the time between moving the shellfish and reharvesting them by testing for contaminants.
"Almost all the towns have some area that's classified restricted," Couture said.
"It's really encouraging that the department is even opening that discussion," she said. "I wouldn't have thought that was something they'd be ready for."
Although it might provide some relief, Nault was quick to outline the problems communities could encounter.
While relaying adults from heartier species, like quahogs, oysters or even scallops can be successful, soft-shell clams pose their own problems, Nault said.
The mortality rate of adult clams skyrockets when they are transferred, which means towns could lose up to half of the animals moved, he said.
That's in addition of the time and energy harvesters need to spend to hand-harvest, transplant, and harvest the clams again, he added.
Even though it might not work to harvest adult clams, the tool could be used to move spawning clams to provide brood stock for other flats, Nault suggested.
There is also some evidence that transferring clams that haven't yet reached legal size and then allowing them to grow in a new area can be a successful tactic, he added.
Considering all the complications involved, Nault said it is doubtful many communities will apply for relay permits, but the Department of Marine Resources would consider any applications on a case-by-case basis if the new rules are approved.
One by one, he flips the cages over, exposing algae and other buildup to the disinfecting effect of the sun and open air.
Gray planted 6,000 American oysters in July. By the end of next summer, he hopes the crop will be ready for harvest.
Until a few years ago, Gray harvested wild mussels, but the disappearance of the resource in Casco Bay -- he went from collecting 2,000 pounds a week a few years ago to less than 100 pounds -- made him rethink how to make a living on the water.
Gray, who is semiretired, said his partial Social Security benefit is the only thing keeping him in the fishing business.
"I'm not making any money from it," he said.
Now, he's one of a handful of new farmers trying aquaculture, the cultivation or farming of shellfish, on the New Meadows, a channel that runs between Brunswick and Harpswell to the west and West Bath to the east.
A couple of well-established farms, including Winterpoint Oysters in West Bath, have etched out a statewide reputation for providing high-quality shellfish from the area. Otherwise, aquaculture has been slow to catch on, despite prime growing conditions.
But as environmental pressures from pollution, invasive species and warming waters mount, local fishermen such as Gray are turning to aquaculture as a means of support.
"There's a lot of uncertainly in commercial fishing in general," said Dana Morse, a researcher at the University of Maine's Sea Grant program.
"It's natural to think that the people involved in those industries are looking for alternatives," he said. Grown products can provide an important counterbalance to wild-caught fish and help preserve Maine's tradition of working waterfronts, he said.
"What I would really look forward to is two healthy industries working side by side," Morse said.
According to the Department of Marine Resources, at the beginning of 2014 there were only nine active aquaculture operations on the New Meadows, including two large, full-time farms.
But since the beginning of the year, the department has issued 10 new licenses to six farmers, a boom that reflects the industry's growth in Maine.
According to Sebastian Belle, director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, the amount of product produced by aquaculture in the state has grown an average of 6 to 8 percent annually for the last 15 years, creating a $100 million industry.
Despite stops and starts, the collective growth is impressive, Belle said.
"There's not a lot of business sectors in the state that have had that kind of growth," he said.
Despite fears that more aquaculture farms would lead to conflicts with other users, there have been very few problems, Belle said.
About 1,300 acres in Maine waters are being cultivated in big, full-time farms with 10-year, 100-acre leases. But most new farmers opt for the simpler Limited Purpose Aquaculture license, which only costs $50 and allows up to 400 square feet of shellfish cultivation.
Morse has a Limited Purpose Aquaculture license with a couple of partners to start a small operation. Like many first-timers, he is starting out with oysters, mainly because the hearty mollusks fetch a high price and are fairly easy to grow.
Peter Francisco, another newcomer to aquaculture, started an oyster farm near his West Bath home this year.
Traveling for his work as a fundraising consultant was draining, he said, and he saw aquaculture as a way to stay closer to home.
Francisco has set up two Limited Purpose Aquacultures and has also applied for an experimental lease. If the first year goes well, he said he'd like to expand his farm, possibly to a full-scale, standard lease.
So far, a strong farming network hasn't sprung up in the New Meadows, but Francisco predicts it will develop.
"I think there's more potential there than what is being realized at this point," he said. "I'd like to help make that happen if I can."
While many new aquaculturists are entrepreneurs like Francisco, industry boosters believe beleaguered fishermen and harvesters, with extensive experience and knowledge of water conditions, local geography and equipment, are ideally positioned to move into growing shellfish.
But making that transition can be hard, Belle cautioned; he compared it to the change from a roaming hunter-gatherer to a sedentary farmer. However, those who move over to aquaculture successfully tend to do better in the long run than people from completely different backgrounds, Belle said.
Last year, the Maine Aquaculture Association, in partnership with local and statewide groups, held an intensive aquaculture training session for lobstermen in Harpswell and the Gouldsboro village of Corea to teach farming and marketing techniques, he said. It is also working with harvesters in Brunswick and other midcoast communities to generate interest in more training sessions.
Tim Johnson, another recent New Meadows farmer, didn't need a training session to see the writing on the wall.
Johnson, a Brunswick clammer since 1982, said the sudden decline in the industry over the past two years encouraged him to move into aquaculture. He established an oyster operation a quarter mile from Gray's.
"The resource just isn't what it was," he said, explaining his move off the clam flats.
If all goes well for his first small operation, he'll consider shifting to full time, Johnson said. But he expects to wait at least three years before seeing a return on his investment.
The delayed payback, as well as the paperwork and regulation involved in setting up even a small farm, might be a turnoff for clammers accustomed to quick returns from harvesting, he noted.
"I think that's a big part of it," Johnson said. "You go a long time without seeing any revenue."
Harvesters' hesitancy to move into aquaculture is unfortunate, he said, because they already have skills and experience that would transfer well, especially into the lucrative oyster business.
There is a sense of urgency for people who want to get into growing, Johnson said: Farm placement is highly regulated by the Department of Marine Resources, and it might not be too long before people from communities outside the New Meadows discover its promise as an aquaculture hub.
For now, the burgeoning industry is still in its early, growth stage.
"Right now, it's pretty wide open," Johnson said. "It's a huge opportunity."

Full text:   Like so many of us, author Kate Christensen loves food. She nearly swoons when talking about the comfort food of her childhood: soft-boiled eggs on toast, tapioca pudding, cottage cheese pancakes, Anadama bread . . .
Harissa Haddock
Serves 4
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 pound fresh haddock (2 good-sized fillets)
2 tablespoons Harissa dry spice mix
1 lemon
2 large leeks, cleaned well and chopped
2 fresh pork chorizo sausages
1 cup red rice
1 3/4 cups chicken broth
1 tablespoon butter
2 pounds baby spinach
8 garlic cloves
1 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon olive oil
Salt to taste
Cut haddock into bite-size pieces and put them in a bowl with the juice of 1 lemon and Harissa spices. Stir well and leave on the counter to marinate. Following the directions on the rice bag for cooking time, simmer 1 cup well-rinsed red rice in 1 3/4 cups chicken broth and 1 tablespoon butter.
Slit the chorizo sausages down the middle and remove the casings so you're left with just the insides. Discard casings. In a big cast-iron skillet, heat olive oil then add chopped leeks and sausage. Stir well, breaking up the chorizo with a spatula. Saute for about 15 minutes until the leeks are soft and the sausage is cooked through. Add the haddock with all the lemon juice to the leeks and chorizo. Cover pan and gently poach for 7-10 minutes. Stir well.
Meanwhile, chop 8 cloves of garlic and add to 1 cup chicken broth and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large pot. Steam 2 pounds baby spinach, covered, for about 5 minutes, or until limp.
Salt to taste. Serve the haddock on top of the rice with the spinach alongside.
From the age of 8, food has been one of the great passions of her life, but instead of choosing a career in the culinary world, Christensen became a writer of fiction, vowing she would make sure to put lots of references to food in her novels. She blogs about her adventures, culinary and otherwise, at www.katechristensen.wordpress.com. She also writes, among other things, "With a Twist," a drinks column for the Wall Street Journal, and is working on another book. "How to Cook a Moose" is about local history, food lore and living in Maine.
It was while living in the Big Apple in the late '80s that Christensen savored all the best books written by famous food writers, such as M.F.K. Fisher, Laurie Colwin and Julia Child, sometimes devouring them one after another as an anecdote for her insomnia. When she finally put her hand to autobiographical writing several years later, she found herself weaving her memories around remembered meals. The result is "Blue Plate Special: An Autobiography of My Appetites."
Published in 2013 by Anchor Books, the memoir is punctuated not only with recipes from Christensen's formative years that she still stirs up to this day, but also includes well-loved dishes discovered during her travels. The title is a nod to her mother, who, when complimented about the simple yet delicious food she served to her three daughters, would say, "Oh, it's nothing but a blue plate special."
"Setting out to write an autobiography wasn't something I intended to do, but putting the past between two covers felt really good," Christensen said.
As Christensen worked on the book, she confirmed something she'd known all along, that food is a way of connecting to others.
"Food provides a reason to bring people together and when you write about it, it's a powerful conduit to memory," she said. "Sometimes I get a strong whiff of something, you know, that steamy smell, an amalgam of meat and vegetables, and everything comes back."
Christensen, who has lived in Berkeley, Ariz., France and New York City, has many fond memories of vacationing in Maine with her family when she was growing up in the '70s. Moving to Portland a couple years ago, she also spends time in the White Mountains where she shares a farmhouse with her partner, Brendan. She spent much of last year promoting "Blue Plate Special" in New England, including reading at Bates College.
Now the author is thrilled to call Maine home. "I always held this certain image in my head of Maine. It was like 'Blueberries for Sal.'"
Christensen, now 52, said her memories of Maine, along with the convenience of living in a city near an airport, were instrumental in bringing her here. Most recently residing in New York City before making the decision to split her time between here and the Granite State, she often flew into Portland International Jetport with Brendan on their way to New Hampshire.
She said of Portland, "We feel like geniuses that we moved here. This is our town!"
The natural-born foodie and prolific writer whose favorite childhood meal was hot dogs, "creamy" corn and carrot coins with margarine, now feasts most frequently on standard American fare such as tomato soup and grilled cheese, tamale pie, meatloaf, chili and peanut butter on toast. She also loves eating steamers, oysters, lobster . . . and bacon.
"If I was giving a party, I'd serve buckwheat blinis with caviar and creme fraiche, shrimp cocktail, oysters, smoked bluefish, melon with prosciutto and bacon-wrapped dates!" Christensen said.
A line from "Blue Plate Special" that describes her discovery of New York City's countless restaurants is very telling of this passionate writer who is always planning out what she'll eat next: "I inhaled all this food; I would have rolled in it if such a thing had been possible."
The witty, vivacious Christensen said she chose these recipes to share because they are the dishes she makes all the time.
"These are quick, easy, cheap and don't have a lot of ingredients," she said. "The Eggplant Pilaf was invented in Minnesota while visiting my sister. We just made it up. I always want food to be cozy and traditional, but have a surprise to it."
This faintly exotic, but deeply comforting, dish will work with any eggplant, but Christensen said the long, small green eggplants are sweeter and more tender than the purple ones.
"The carbonara is a decadent rendition of a decadent recipe," Christensen said. "The first time I made it, we ate the entire thing standing up in the kitchen."
Double-Your-Pleasure Carbonara
Serves 4
1 pound spaghetti or linguine
8 ounces slab bacon or pancetta, chopped
4 garlic cloves, sliced
4 tablespoons olive oil
4 eggs
2 cups grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
Black pepper to taste
1 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
Cook the pasta according to the directions until just softer than al dente.
While pasta cooks, saute bacon and garlic in hot olive oil until crisp.
In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and add 1 1/2 cups cheese, plus plenty of black pepper. When pasta is done, drain it well and toss in the skillet with bacon and garlic until coated. Add to the egg-cheese mixture, tossing it fast and lightly until the strands of pasta are coated with the silky egg and melted cheese.
Serve immediately with the remaining grated cheese and chopped parsley.
Green Eggplant Pilaf
Serves 4-6
6 small green eggplants (or 1 large or 2 smaller purple eggplants), chopped small
2 tablespoons olive oil plus 1 tablespoon olive oil
1 red onion, minced
4 large cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried basil
Black pepper and salt to taste
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 1/2 cups wild rice blend (Lundberg's is recommended)
2 3/4 cups chicken stock or broth
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon lemon zest
3/4 cup toasted pine nuts
3/4 cup grated pecorino-Romano cheese
Saute the eggplant over medium-low heat with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a cast iron skillet, stirring until brown and soft, for about 15 minutes, then put aside.
Add 1 more tablespoon olive oil and saute onion and garlic. Add basil, black pepper, salt, cinnamon and cumin. When the onions are soft, add the wild rice blend, broth, tomato paste and lemon zest. Add the eggplant back in and stir well.
Cover and let simmer until the rice is cooked, about 45 minutes. Serve with toasted pine nuts and grated pecorino-Romano cheese.

Full text:   PORTLAND (AP) -- Maine wants to know what its fishermen and aquaculture workers think of invasive green crabs.
The state's Department of Marine Resources says in a statement that it will ask the professionals about the "growing threat of invasive European green crabs to Maine fisheries and aquaculture." The department is sending targeted mails surveys to harvesters and growers throughout coastal Maine. The department says Lobster Zone Councils, Maine Aquaculture Association, Municipal Shellfish Committees and the department's advisory councils will administer the survey.
Questions will ask professionals if they encounter green crabs, whether they have observed changes in crab population recently, and whether the species is impacting marine resources. A taskforce will use the information to make recommendations to Gov. Paul LePage.

Harpswell group cleaning up Quahog Bay -- 1 boat at a time

Author: McGuire, Peter; The Forecaster

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]03 July 2014.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1542583693?accountid=10457

Abstract: For the past five years, the northeast side of Quahog Bay has been closed to shellfish harvesters because of raw sewage suspected of being discharged from recreation vessels that frequent the popular "cocktail cove." In the northeastern part of Quahog Bay, poor water quality ratings are attributed to the armada of recreational boaters who anchor for a night or weekend, David Hunter, who heads Quahog Bay Conservation, said. "Everything is set up and ready," Hunter said. "Now it's up to the boaters to do the right thing."

Full text:   HARPSWELL -- For the past five years, the northeast side of Quahog Bay has been closed to shellfish harvesters because of raw sewage suspected of being discharged from recreation vessels that frequent the popular "cocktail cove."
Now, thanks to the generosity of an area landowner, the Quahog Bay Conservation group is attempting to turn back the tide by offering a free, waterborne pump-out service for vessels anchored in the bay.
Strict federal regulations prohibit the harvest and sale of shellfish in areas that are contaminated by sewage or are at risk of contamination.
In the northeastern part of Quahog Bay, poor water quality ratings are attributed to the armada of recreational boaters who anchor for a night or weekend, David Hunter, who heads Quahog Bay Conservation, said.
Though it is working on other projects, such as setting out about 100 green crab traps and developing a trash cleanup program, the group's centerpiece is a 24-foot skiff outfitted with a 300-gallon sewage tank and motorized suction pump.
At the helm of the boat during a tour last week, Hunter pointed out more than a dozen empty moorings in between the small islands dotting the bay's water.
Seven monitoring stations set around the bay are already showing degraded water quality, even though the boating season has barely started, he said.
"It's like Fourth of July out there every weekend," Hunter said.
Hunter and the boat are offering free, on-call pump-outs. All an owner needs to do is call him and set up a time to service the boat's tank.
So far, Hunter and his assistant, Peter Valente, have pumped out two vessels and made contacts with more than 20 other boaters, explaining the issues facing Quahog Bay and letting them know the service is available.
In 2009, the Maine Department of Marine Resources closed Quahog Bay to harvesting because of poor water quality. The bay's east side was upgraded to a conditional closure in 2011, allowing harvesting during the off-season from October to late May.
The conservation group's goal is to limit discharge from boats to the extent that the department allows year-round harvesting.
Even though dumping closer than three miles from shore is illegal -- all of Casco Bay is a discharge-free zone -- statewide enforcement is virtually nonexistent and distinguishing between boat owners who follow the rules and those who decide to open the valves underneath the hull and let their sewage flow out is impossible.
"I think most people want to do the right thing, but it just takes one to mess it up for everyone," Hunter said.
A Harpswell native, Hunter runs the operation for the Scanlan family, who recently purchased Snow Island and set up Quahog Bay Conservation as a way to give back to the community.
The new group is one of only a few in the state offering mobile pump-out services. Friends of Casco Bay, the South Portland-based nonprofit, floats an on-call pump-out service that works on vessels as far away as Freeport.
Since it was established in 1995, that pump-out boat has kept 110,000 gallons of raw sewage from being dumped, Associate Director Mary Cerullo said.
Although its program has been successful and helped educate boaters, it hasn't provided a solution to the problem, she added.
"It's one step at a time to clean up this stuff," Cerullo said.
The presence of the Harpswell pump-out boat will be "hugely helpful" to the Department of Marine Resources if it considers reopening the area to harvesting, said Alison Sirois, a public health supervisor for the department.
In a scenario where there are mainly transient boats, with a readily available pump-out station, the department can determine that the risk of contamination is reduced to an acceptable level, Sirois said.
The fact that Great Island Boatyard, at the head of Quahog Bay, also provides a free pump-out service, gives reopening the flats an even better chance, she added.
The success of the pump-out programs elsewhere gives cause for hope that launching an aggressive cleanup effort might improve water quality to the point the state reconsiders reopening the flats in Quahog Bay.
"Everything is set up and ready," Hunter said. "Now it's up to the boaters to do the right thing."
To schedule a pump-out or for more information, contact Quahog Bay Conservation at 522-1105.

Shoreline showdown? Environmental activists demand action at Kidder Point

Abstract: "I was a little stunned, actually," [Mark Green] said Tuesday morning of the pH numbers from the point. "You wouldn't find clams there. They wouldn't survive. They would dissolve." "To us, remediating this site would be really important low-hanging fruit in dealing with ocean acidification. It's sitting there in front of you. Easy to remediate," he said this week. "But then the four-letter word 'cost' comes up." "That's just crazy acidic," Green said of the Kidder Point samples, which contained very little organic matter that might change the pH one way or another. "That's completely not natural."

Full text:   SEARSPORT -- On a hot, muggy morning in early July, Bob Ramsdell took a small hand rake and dug into the sandbar near the Sears Island Causeway, searching until he triumphantly pulled out a plump steamer clam.
Ramsdell, the enthusiastic chairman of the Searsport Shellfish Management Committee and a retired teacher, wasn't digging up his dinner. He was showing off some of the areas where clams can be found near Kidder Point, close to the smokestacks and outbuildings of the GAC Chemical Corp. plant.
He said that while the flats right next to the chemical company are open for clamming, he wouldn't personally eat clams dug there, just in case there is residual contamination from the century-old plant.
"I've been reading the information, and that's enough to keep me from clamming," he said.
The area, littered with mussel and clam shells and watched over Wednesday morning by wheeling seagulls and a pair of bald eagles, has been a recent focal point of controversy in the midcoast area.
An environmental activist group, Friends of Penobscot Bay, this winter contracted an oceanographer from St. Joseph's College in Standish to do pH analyses of some sediment samples collected at Kidder Point.
Dr. Mark Green this week told the BDN that the acidification in the clam flats on the point is the worst he's seen in Maine, and the activist group is loudly calling for federal agencies to do remediation.
"I was a little stunned, actually," Green said Tuesday morning of the pH numbers from the point. "You wouldn't find clams there. They wouldn't survive. They would dissolve."
But an official with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection said that the agency last fall surveyed the shoreline near the GAC Chemical Corp., and found no signs that any type of contamination is seeping into the soil or water there.
They dug through sediment, looking for discoloration or waste materials, and found no red flags.
"We didn't find anything wrong," Jessamine Logan, spokesperson for the DEP, said Tuesday. "We sent people who are hazardous materials specialists. They know what they're looking for."
Kidder Point has long been a focus of Friends of Penobscot Bay, which executive director Ron Huber has described as a 'gadfly group' of environmental activists.
Over the years they have been involved in many Searsport matters, including the recent fight over the proposed liquid propane gas tank and the battle over the future of Sears Island.
Huber last summer began a new call for action to remediate what he said was pollution leftover from past practices that may have left toxins leaching into the bay. He alleged that the pollution includes sulfuric acid and heavy metals.
"To us, remediating this site would be really important low-hanging fruit in dealing with ocean acidification. It's sitting there in front of you. Easy to remediate," he said this week. "But then the four-letter word 'cost' comes up."
Huber contacted Green this winter and asked him to run tests on sediment samples, which Huber and others collected based on the scientist's instructions. They put the samples on freezer packs and overnighted them to Green's laboratory, according to the oceanographer.
The results of the testing he did were shocking, Green said.
Solutions with a pH of less than 7 are acidic, and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. Green said he would normally expect that kind of sediment to be in the low-to-mid 7s range.
Instead, one of the sediment samples tested at 1.5. In comparison, pure water has a pH of close to 7. Pure citric acid has a pH of about 2.2.
"That's just crazy acidic," Green said of the Kidder Point samples, which contained very little organic matter that might change the pH one way or another. "That's completely not natural."
Huber reported Kidder Point to the National Response Center, the federal agency that is a clearinghouse for pollution complaints. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report from the National Response Center about Kidder Point on June 3, according to Lt. Commander Timothy Balunis, Jr., the chief of the incident management division for Coast Guard Sector Northern New England.
Balunis wrote in an email to the BDN that his agency conducted a preliminary investigation into the pollution report, reviewing material provided by Friends of Penobscot Bay as well as results from several site visits and investigations by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection over the last 15 years.
"The Coast Guard has determined to close its investigation, and defers to Maine DEP's long-running investigation of this site," Balunis wrote, adding that Kidder Point has never been classified as a 'Superfund Incident' or site, as Huber has written on his publicity materials.
The activist has said that people in his organization will go to Kidder Point every Sunday afternoon to inform visitors of the pollution issues there.
"This is a public health hazard. Let's get it dealt with," he wrote in June.
However, Logan said that the DEP does not believe the area is a hazard to public health. The agency has done a number of routine inspections there, finding no problems.
"The information from [Green] conflicts with what we observed in our investigation," she said. "We will not be further looking into it."
Jeff Nichols of the Maine Department of Marine Resources said that "without the ability to verify the quality of the samples [tested by Green], which is critical to any scientific analysis, the department can't comment on the results of these tests."
Nichols added that, in general, the state's new ocean acidification commission will work to identify the actual and potential effects of coastal and ocean acidification on commercially-valuable marine species and figure out a strategy to address identified problems.
David Colter, president and CEO of GAC Chemical Corp., said in a statement issued Wednesday that the intertidal area below the plant has been studied extensively over the last 30 years, and an ongoing sampling and water quality monitoring program is being conducted in coordination with the Maine DEP.
A recent study has shown that marine life there is reproducing and growing, he said, and no remediation of the area is recommended.
"We believe in working proactively with regulatory authorities, which we have done and will continue to do," he said. "GAC is unaware of any current reputable study which suggests or demonstrates that the intertidal area presents a current threat to human health or the environment."
But Huber is not bothered by officials who question his study and his methods.
"Unless they come down and gather some samples, it's just so much hot air," he said. "Here is what we think is there. Would you please go check?"

Full text:   HARRISON -- To launch the six week season, Deertrees Theatre invites everyone to attend their Season Launch Open House on Thursday, June 26. Begin the day with a delightful Ploughman's Lunch (deli style) served from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. while listening to music provided by local artists. View the art exhibit and sale provided by Gallery 302. Peruse a display of Native American artifacts. Admire the cavalcade of vintage cars on the grounds. Bring your antiques for appraisal by Harry Hepburn III and David Kimball ($10 an item or three for $25. All proceeds benefit the Deertrees fundraiser.) After the Lake Region Chamber Members Business-After-Hours from 5-7 p.m. treat yourself to a free, complimentary concert featuring singer-songwriter Carolyn Currie, from 7:15-8:15 p.m.
Currie's performance will present captivating, poetic music influenced by Celtic folk songs. Having won numerous awards for her songwriting and performances, most recently the prestigious 2014 Wildflower Performing Songwriter Competition, Currie will enthrall you with her enchanting lyrics and melodies.
It has been 78 years since Deertrees Theatre opened its doors for the very first time and launched its first season of performances. A great deal has happened since then to what some affectionately call, "Maine's Most Enchanting Playhouse."
The theater's trials and tribulations over the years have been well documented and as recently as 2012 the grand old place faced impending closure. However, a policy of taking things slow and sure for the building and programming has been implemented and the future is looking brighter, according to the theater's executive director, Andrew Harris.
"The Board and those who have a great deal of affection and affinity with the theatre are ensuring it has a sustainable future. Each year we are making improvements to the building and critically looking at the programming. We may not be moving as fast as we would like to but each decision is being carefully considered and then implemented with the aim of realizing a bright future for this remarkable playhouse. We are already looking at how our 80th anniversary year might shape up!"
But for now it appears their plans are at full throttle for this year, with a schedule that runs from July 5 through Aug. 16, with concerts, visual arts, and theater, which is where the new initiative gathers momentum. Deertrees New Repertory Company has been formed and will present three plays with each being performed for four nights intermittently throughout the season.
This summer Deertrees Theatre will stage two comedies and a fun play especially written for family audiences. "The Selfish Shellfish" written by David Wood will bring a rock pool alive with an array of outlandish characters and deliver a powerful, and fun message about our environment. The other two plays, "Heroes" and "The Grand O'Neal" are perfect summer fare, being both funny and highly entertaining.

Full text:   FARMINGTON -- Robert E. "Lefty" Parlin, 89, passed away peacefully at his Farmington home, surrounded by his loved ones, on Thursday, June 5.
Robert E. "Lefty" Parlin
Bob was born on May 17, 1925, the son of Millard and Alverna Wells Parlin of New Vineyard. After graduating from Farmington High School, Bob was drafted into the U.S. Navy in September 1943, serving aboard a landing craft as a gunners' mate first class in the Pacific Theater. Discharged in March 1946, "Lefty" returned to his hometown where he was employed by the MDOT, eventually becoming a highway supervisor, before retiring in 1987.
On Oct. 4, 1946, he married the love of his life, Alice Hagerstrom. They lived in Fairbanks for 67 years, where they raised their three children, Janis, Vicki and Gary. Later in life, he became affectionately known as "Buppa" to his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
One of Bob's greatest passions was baseball. On Aug. 17, 2008, he was elected to the Maine Baseball Hall of Fame to celebrate his legacy as a hard-hitting first baseman and legendary Little League coach. He started all four years at Farmington High School and after returning from the Navy, he became a small town legend, playing for both the New Vineyard and Temple Town teams.
In 1960, after retiring from playing, he formed the Fairbanks Little League team, which he coached for the next 23 years, amassing a record of 270 wins and 62 losses. His teams won 18 league championships during his reign. One of his great memories was how his Red Sox brought together the entire village of Fairbanks. The oyster stew suppers, trips to Fenway Park and of course, the many games and practices that inspired so many. Bob Parlin was a legend in Fairbanks. One of the local townsfolk was quoted as saying, "No one will ever know how many kids' lives he has touched. He is truly loved in Fairbanks for making a difference."
He is survived by his three children, Janis Haggan and her husband, Barry, of Lewiston, Vicki Hardy and her husband, Tim, of Farmington and Gary Parlin and his wife, Sharon, of Farmington; grandchildren, Barry "Rocky" Haggan of Lewiston, Tammy Cowans and her husband, Rob, of Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, Tim "TD" Hardy and his wife, Bett, of Farmington, Kaitlyn Bruder and her husband, Charlie, of Falmouth and Cole Parlin and his wife, Hillary, of Kittery; and great-grandchildren, Kyle and Shania Haggan, Colby and Chase Bruder, Dylan and Keira Cowan and Jackson and Benjamin Hardy. Bob is also survived by his cat and companion, "Lefty."
Bob was predeceased by his wife, Alice; his brothers, Millard "Sonny" Parlin and Roger Parlin; and grandson, Shawn Haggan.
The family would like to thank Beacon Hospice and all the loving caregivers who made it possible for Bob to spend his final days at home.
Condolences may be sent for the family at www.adamsmcfarlane.com.

Barry Costa-Pierce and Craig Pendleton: Bond package needed to sustain the marine industry

Abstract: Yet Maine's marine economy is constantly under duress. Nearly every day there is a story about a new challenge facing Maine's fishing families: Shrimp season canceled; scallops season shortened; tempers flaring over limited elver licenses; Canadian processors blocking the border to keep our lobster out; cod stocks limited; urchins overfished; lobster shell disease and warming waters threatening; spiny dogfish populations booming and no one wanting them; and, now we have the green crab threatening fried clam dinners and causing conflicts on the mudflats between wormers and clammers. We cannot surrender Maine's marine economy. If we do, we surrender Maine's brand, the essence of Maine, the very thing that makes us so special. A pending bond to support Maine's marine economy would be matched by a minimum 1-to-1 funding from private sources. The bond is designed to forge collaboration between Maine's premier research institutions, fishing and aquaculture families, existing marine businesses, processors, and the entire seafood supply chain.

Full text:   Maine's marine economy accounts for about 36,000 jobs and more than $500 million in annual economic activity. The Maine brand is synonymous with our rugged coast, our fishing families, and the results of thousands of lives spent on and by the sea.
Through the centuries, artists have come to Maine to capture our maritime life. From Winslow Homer to Andrew Wyeth, Maine's coast and the people who make their living from the sea have come to symbolize our state.
And yet Maine's marine economy is constantly under duress. Nearly every day there is a story about a new challenge facing Maine's fishing families: Shrimp season canceled; scallops season shortened; tempers flaring over limited elver licenses; Canadian processors blocking the border to keep our lobster out; cod stocks limited; urchins overfished; lobster shell disease and warming waters threatening; spiny dogfish populations booming and no one wanting them; and, now we have the green crab threatening fried clam dinners and causing conflicts on the mudflats between wormers and clammers.
To be clear, not all the news is bad. Maine leads the nation with its emerging marine aquaculture industry. We have diversified our wild fisheries and protected our fish stock by embracing new technologies.
We have some of the first pioneers who began the Community Supported Fisheries movement and promoted an ecosystem approach to fishery management. Ocean Approved harvests seaweed for markets all around the world; Ducktrap processes and smokes salmon that is widely recognized as world-class; Brown Trading is a seafood conduit to the finest restaurants in New York and the world; oysters from the Damariscotta river are served at raw bars everywhere; and, new products and strategies are being developed in the labs on Beals Island, Bigelow Labs, the Darling Center, the University of New England, and up and down the Maine coast.
The success of Maine's marine economy depends on adding value to our wild fish stock, supporting our marine aquaculture industry and providing new markets for seafood and marine products. We can do this, and indeed, we must.
We cannot surrender Maine's marine economy. If we do, we surrender Maine's brand, the essence of Maine, the very thing that makes us so special.
Here's the vision: instead of harvesting elvers and selling them to China -- where they put them in aquaculture tanks and ponds to grow to maturity, and then sell them to Japan for processing, and then send them back to the United States and Europe to be sold in sushi restaurants and elsewhere -- we should do all of that here in Maine.
This is only one example, but the lesson is clear: we need to localize the seafood value chain as much as possible. We need to vertically integrate our marine economy so that we are not only growing and harvesting the best seafood and marine products, but we are also processing and adding value.
What we could do with elvers we could also do for halibut, mussels, seaweeds and new products, such as spiny dogfish.
There is a powerful vision that Maine's wild fisheries, aquaculture technologies and people can work together as communities of practice to harness the power of not only our emerging aquaculture industry, but also how that industry can enhance the sustainability of capture fisheries.
Here's a success story: in Cobscook Bay at the Learning Center, premier Maine chefs like Sam Hayward, food processors like David Barber, and educators like Alan Furth, have come together to build seafood pies. Now, not only do we fish for lobsters then process them here, we add value by making delicious seafood pies.
That is the seafood value chain in action. Employment comes not only from the harvests, but from product development, identification of new markets and global sales.
A pending bond to support Maine's marine economy would be matched by a minimum 1-to-1 funding from private sources. The bond is designed to forge collaboration between Maine's premier research institutions, fishing and aquaculture families, existing marine businesses, processors, and the entire seafood supply chain.
This is a true port-to-plate strategy.
So, while our wild fisheries are facing mounting challenges, our opportunity lies in changing our collaborative, respectful approaches to the marine economy by embracing fisheries and allied aquacultures, new product developments, vertically integration of processing and value-added products and, most importantly, providing real-time hands-on support for those working on the Maine coast.
The prosperity of our marine economy underpins the future success of Maine.

Full text:   PORTLAND (AP) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Maine's Bigelow Laboratory to use a new method of testing shellfish toxicity that lab officials say is the first of its kind in the nation.
The East Boothbay lab tests shellfish samples provided by the Maine Department of Marine Resources for paralytic shellfish toxins. A laboratory spokeswoman said researchers will now analyze a slurry made of shellfish. The work began this week.
Lab officials said the method replaces an old process that involved testing on mice. That process had been used for 40 years. Officials said the new way is more precise and efficient.
Lab officials said Maine's rollout of the program will be a model for the rest of the United States. European countries, Australia, and New Zealand use similar methods.

Abstract: "Green crabs are threatening our state's $25 million bivalve shellfish industry, which is Maine's third most lucrative fishery," [Paul LePage] said in prepared remarks. "It's critical that we protect the fishery and the good jobs the industry supports." "Green crabs not only endanger a vital segment of Maine's fishing economy, but this invasive species could destroy some of Maine's most famous dishes, including steamed clams and the fried clam dinner," LePage added.

Full text:   ROCKPORT -- In response to growing concern about the effect invasive green crabs are having on Maine's shoreline, Gov. Paul LePage announced Friday that he is establishing a task force to examine the issue, effective immediately.
LePage made the announcement while attending the annual Maine Fishermen's Forum in Rockport.
"Green crabs are threatening our state's $25 million bivalve shellfish industry, which is Maine's third most lucrative fishery," LePage said in prepared remarks. "It's critical that we protect the fishery and the good jobs the industry supports."
The population of green crabs, an invasive species from Europe that first migrated to North America in the 1800s, has surged in Maine in the past few years.
Warmer temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, a lack of predators and competitors in their habitat, and the absence in North America of a parasite that inhibits their reproduction rates in Europe all are considered factors in their population surge, scientists have said.
Shellfish harvesters say the crabs have dug up and decimated populations of softshell clams in mudflats along the entire coast.
"Green crabs not only endanger a vital segment of Maine's fishing economy, but this invasive species could destroy some of Maine's most famous dishes, including steamed clams and the fried clam dinner," LePage added.
Speaking off the cuff, LePage said the state did not have money to conduct scientific studies on the situation, which he pointedly blamed on the Legislature.
"Unfortunately, if the Legislature had a little bit of foresight and not robbed every account in the state for welfare, we could use some money for research, but that has not been forthcoming and likely is not going to be forthcoming, so whatever happens is going to have to be done at the executive level," LePage said. "I see some legislators smiling here, so they know who they are."
The task force will consist of 12 people not yet appointed. Groups that will have representatives on the task force include the state departments of Marine Resources, Environmental Protection, Economic and Community Development, municipalities with local shellfish regulations, clam industry representatives and researchers with economic or marine science backgrounds.
The task force is charged with assessing the effect of green crabs along the coast, coming up with possible solutions to controlling their population, weighing the economic costs of those solutions and considering other possible steps, according to the proclamation establishing the body.
The order sets a deadline of Sept. 30 of this year for submitting a report with recommendations back to the governor and then will be dissolved.

Abstract: Taxicab owners Tuesday will ask the Auburn City Council to approve changes to the city's five rate zones to avert a price hike by increasing fares for longer distance travelers. A letter to the council signed by owners of all five taxicab companies serving the city states that reducing the size of the zones and establishing outlying rate districts would "make it more cost effective to travel to the outer areas of the city. According to the letter, a rider traveling from K-Mart on Center Street to No Tomatoes Restaurant on Main Street pays $3.25 for the 4.5-mile cab ride. But a fare from K-Mart to Vickery Road, almost nine miles across the city, pays the same rate.

A more effective or delightful program has seldom been witnessed in Lewiston city hall, than the Colonial Minuet given there, Friday evening, this being the closing night of the Colonial carnival given under the auspices of St. Joseph's parish. Forty couples filled the floor and with the effective costumes of the colonial day, the graceful steps of the minuet were danced to orchestral accompaniment. The young people were trained by Miss May Holmes of Bates College, and they certainly did justice to her careful instructions. An oyster supper was served during the evening and the large audience which witnessed the program enjoyed dancing until Midnight.

Gerard Construction Co. Inc of Lewiston was named yesterday the general contract for the new modern one-story building to be erected on Center Street, Auburn, as the new home for Snow's Inc. The Lewiston firm was the low bidder among six general contractors for the project. Work on the project will start immediately, according to Stanley G. Snow of Auburn, president of the firm, with the actual ground breaking to take place as soon as possible. The new building, which will house the retail and wholesale store as well as an eight-bay modern automobile service center, will occupy some 24,000 square feet of floor space. It will be only one-story in height and will be constructed on a lot at 166 Center St.

Abstract: Recent state recommendations designed to improve the water quality of the Androscoggin River are inadequate, a member of the Androscoggin River Committee said this week. "Odor, foam, color -- it doesn't seem any of those things has really been addressed," Peter Rubins said of the recommendations regarding water classifications of the river made by state Department of Environmental Protection staffers. Rubins, an Auburn resident, is on the board of the Androscoggin River Committee, a local non-profit corporation that formed about two years ago to act as a vehicle for public comment and oversight of the river.

Irving Rodman, head of the Dane - T - Bits Biscuit Co., squelched last night a rumor concerning a further shutdown at Cookieville. Rodman said no such action is contemplated, that instead the second shift will be back at work as soon as some new bakery units are installed. The company head said the new bakery units reportedly were shipped yesterday and should be delivered here by the end of the week. He said it will take about a week or so to install the new units and then the second shift will be back at work. Currently only one shift is at work turning out cookies.

Full text:   SOUTH BRISTOL -- The Maine Department of Environmental Protection, U.S. Coast Guard, Maine Marine Patrol and Lincoln County hazardous materials team are at the scene of an oil spill in the Damariscotta River in the village of Walpole in South Bristol.
The Maine DEP was notified at approximately 9 a.m. Friday that a barge at the Mook Sea Farm aquaculture facility, which cultivates oysters, had been damaged by ice, DEP spokeswoman Jessamine Logan said.
It is not yet clear what type of oil spilled or how much, according to Coast Guard spokesman Connan Ingham, but the oil is not diesel or gasoline, as previously reported. Also, Ingham said the barge is not sinking.
The spill occurred across the river from Dodge Lower Cove, about two miles west of Bristol center.
The Bristol Fire Department contained the oil sheen within floating booms, and contractors Colby and Gale are on scene emptying the remaining fuel from the barge, according to Ingham.
The Coast Guard sent a 47-foot boat to secure a safety perimeter, and a pollution response team remained on scene early Friday afternoon. The boat has since cleared, Ingham said.

Green crabs: If we can't beat them, maybe we should eat them

Full text:   BRUNSWICK -- A Canadian businessman hopes to market invasive European green crabs -- which are devastating Maine shellfish and eelgrass beds -- as human food.
Troy R. Bennett/Bangor Daily News
Would you eat this crab? A businessman wants to harvest the invasive species and sell as sea food.
Ron Howse of Tidalwater Seafood Co., based in Fredericton, New Brunswick, will boil and serve the tiny crabs during a news conference Thursday afternoon in Brunswick.
Howse is working with officials in Ellsworth and Lubec, and most recently held a second meeting on Monday at Brunswick Landing to discuss the possibility of building a processing plant at the former Navy base. He said he has discussed free trade zones and other tax policies with the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development, and awaits more information from them.
"I think we're very close" to a decision, Howse said Thursday.
While green crabs are typically too small to be picked for a profit, Howse said he is working with a company in China -- he declined to name it -- to patent a system of extracting and packaging the meat.
"Traditionally in most crab extraction systems, it really is a lot of hand picking," he said. "We have exclusive use of a computer program machine that picks the crab, takes the meat out of the crab and it comes out of the extraction system bagged and ready for deep-freeze."
Shareholders have already invested in the project, but he declined to say what the total investment is to date, or how much he plans to invest, Howse said.
Howse's business plan projects 150 jobs in the plant itself, with 550 additional "indirect" jobs such as fishermen, truckers and accountants.
The location of the plant will be determined by a number of factors, Howse said, including proximity to the crabs.
Each of the three communities offers unique advantages, Howse said. Lubec is attractive because of its shallow estuaries and "significant biomass of green crabs" reported by divers and other industry sources, but the cold water temperatures limit processing to warmer months. The softshell clam industry in Brunswick and Freeport areas has been devastated by green crabs over the last year, and warmer water would allow a year-round fishery.
While the plant would be located in one community, "holding facilities" could be built in the other two towns and shipments would go through Bangor International Airport.
Depending on which community is chosen for the project, he said the plant could be "up and running by April 15."
Darcie Couture, formerly of the Maine Department of Marine Resources and now a private consultant working with the town of Freeport to tackle the problems posed by green crabs, said Thursday that she looks forward to hearing more specifics about Howse's business plan.
"Everybody in the region is very excited about any use for green crabs, but the economic driver is missing now," she said. "We hope [Howse] is able to provide a little more information."
Past efforts in Maine to find a market or economically feasible way to deal with green crabs have come up short. At a December 2013 conference on the marine pests, no one could offer any proven way to sell large amounts of them for enough money to make catching crabs worthwhile.

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- Following a three-hour public hearing that drew hundreds of worm diggers and clam harvesters from up and down the Maine coast, a bill designed to prohibit the digging of blood worms in mudflats closed for conservation moved forward on Wednesday, albeit in a different form and with far fewer restrictions on worm digging.

If enacted, LD 1452, sponsored by Sen. Stan Gerzofsky, D-Brunswick, and supported by the Brunswick Marine Resources Committee, would have allowed towns with shellfish ordinances to request that the Department of Marine Resources prohibit marine worm harvesting in mudflats also closed to clam harvesters for conservation by the town's committee.
An amended version of the bill proposed limiting the closure to 10 percent of digable flats, and only in areas in which communities had taken extensive conservation measures such as netting and traps to protect against invasive green crabs -- which both factions on Wednesday agreed are industry-threatening predators of both worms and clams.
Clam harvesters maintain that worm diggers decimate the flats, digging the same area over and over again without concern about areas designated for conservation closures designed to restore shellfish populations.
"It's like reseeding your front lawn, then having someone come in with a pitchfork and turn it over again and again," testified Mark Latti, chairman of the Brunswick Marine Resources Committee.
Proponents spoke extensively of the damage to flats by green crabs, and the need to take action to preserve the habitat.
But one after another, worm diggers told the committee that the bill would rob them of their livelihood and hand control of one industry, worming, to another, clamming. They argued that invasive green crabs are the true predator of clams and marine worms and that the decline of productive clam flats shouldn't "be put on the backs of the worm diggers."
While the majority of the Brunswick and Freeport legislative delegation spoke in support of the bill, Rep. Peter Kent, D-Woolwich, told the committee that a previous study concluded that worm digging does not affect the population of juvenile clams.
"Unless the town can present some sort of proof [that worm digging does affect clamming], this could be a random exclusion of wormers," he said, calling for "a comprehensive approach based on science."
The bill first came forward during last year's legislative session. After a public hearing, Gerzofsky said he would place the bill on hold while the two groups ironed out a memorandum of understanding -- by May 15 -- or else refer the bill to committee.
The Brunswick Marine Resources Committee and worm diggers crafted a gentleman's agreement under which the committee would notify worm dealers of closures, and the dealers would post the closures for all worm diggers to see. That agreement worked, according to both sides, until August 2013, according to Dan Harrington of Harrington Bait in Woolwich.
Prior to Wednesday's hearing, Harrington said that the Brunswick Marine Resources Committee reopened an area of mudflats in August but failed to tell worm dealers.
"We considered it a broken agreement," he said. "They called it a hiccup or a mistake."
After that, wholesalers no longer posted maps and announcements of closures, and the "gentleman's agreement" fell through.
After three hours of testimony Wednesday, DMR Commissioner Patrick Keliher, who opposed the bill as written, offered a new version which the committee voted 9-1 to recommend for passage by the full Legislature.
Under the new language, which remains to be crafted, anyone destroying or molesting fencing or other devices placed by marine resources committees around areas seeded with clams, to help eradicate predators -- including green crabs -- will face a fine of $300 to $1,500.
"This is going to be a very focused effort on predator control," he said.
Rep. Elizabeth Dickerson, D-Rockland, was the only Marine Resources Committee member who opposed the rewritten bill. Dickinson said she was concerned about ceding control of the flats to municipalities and about a lack of enforcement oversight.
Following the vote, Harrington said the new language is "better than the alternative," but called it "the camel's nose sticking in the tent," and said he expected more restrictions to follow. He added that process has "driven a wedge even further between the clammers and wormers ... it's disheartening."
"I think [the new language] is a step in the right direction," Brunswick Marine Resource Officer Dan Devereaux said. "In the next legislative session, we need to come back with a more comprehensive bill to look at the entirety of the issue."

Full text:   PORTLAND (AP) -- The owner of a Maine seafood company has pleaded guilty to instructing an employee to make cash withdrawals to avoid Treasury Department reporting requirements, money used to bypass lobster coop purchasing rules.
The Portland Press Herald (http://bit.ly/1dTRR7O ) reported that John Price, owner of J.P.'s Shellfish in Eliot, pleaded guilty in federal court on Tuesday to 12 counts of structuring cash transactions.
Prosecutors say the 58-year-old Kittery man had an office manager make bank withdrawals from 2008 to 2010 for less than $10,000 to avoid detection.
Employees then used the cash to pay a dock worker at the Spruce Head Fisherman's Coop in South Thomaston for lobsters. The dock worker's side transactions were made without Coop approval.
Price remains free on $10,000 bail pending sentencing in May. His lawyer refused comment.

Abstract: "Over the river and through the woods" was a familiar refrain in an old tune. It sounds like a pleasant description of a trip to Grandma's house, but many years ago such an outing could turn into "a night to remember forever." That's how my aunt recalled one frigid winter night in the mid 1920s. It was a trip from our Auburn farm across the frozen Androscoggin River to visit relatives in Greene. "I was frightened and, at the same time, eager," she wrote, as she described how Polly, the family's high-spirited horse, "snorted great clouds of steam as she left her warm stall and was backed between the shafts of the pung." Heated bricks had been wrapped in newspaper and placed in the deep straw at their feet. "By the last mile, the mood hushed to stargazing, and finally the party was warmed by hot oyster stew at the Grange hall," he said. "Then it was 'Seeing Nellie Home' in your own one-horse sleigh."

Full text:   "Over the river and through the woods" was a familiar refrain in an old tune. It sounds like a pleasant description of a trip to Grandma's house, but many years ago such an outing could turn into "a night to remember forever." That's how my aunt recalled one frigid winter night in the mid 1920s. It was a trip from our Auburn farm across the frozen Androscoggin River to visit relatives in Greene.
Edith Sargent was then 6 or 7 years old and my father, who was in his teens, was taking Edith and my grandmother by sleigh along that star-lit river highway. Many years later, she told about the experience in her Lewiston Evening Journal Magazine Section column.
"I was frightened and, at the same time, eager," she wrote, as she described how Polly, the family's high-spirited horse, "snorted great clouds of steam as she left her warm stall and was backed between the shafts of the pung." Heated bricks had been wrapped in newspaper and placed in the deep straw at their feet.
"I was apprehensive because I had often seen the river freeze over in front of our house just below the Deer Rips Dam and then break loose the next day," she wrote. "I had watched great hunks of ice like huge Juggernauts smash and grind against the shore. I had heard my father tell of teams that went through the ice."
No tragedies befell the trio that night. The horse eased herself down the bank to the river ice just above the newly built Gulf Island Dam. Edith cringed when Polly crashed through the shell ice along the shore, but their reliable horse quickly pulled the pung onto thick ice.
"Polly shook her head in surprise as she found that the pung with its load practically moved of its own accord along the slick surface," Edith wrote. "Her greatest problem was to keep from getting bumped by the runners. Sharp calks made her sure-footed."
The rest of the trip spun magical memories.
"There were no lights in sight other than the quarter moon and the stars. Empty farmhouses, deserted when the river flooded their fields (behind the new dam), had settled down into snowdrifts like crooked little boxes. It looked like a toy world."
Suddenly there came a vague sound, my aunt recalled.
"At first it was more a feeling than a sound. Polly pricked up her ears and pranced sideways. The sound increased. It became an ominous roll that traveled from shore to shore as though some giant had a tremendous stomach ache. Then the tone became shrill and shattered the night with a blood curdling scream."
My father laughed.
"That's only the ice growling," he told his little sister and his mother. He said it was easing the pressure of the cold.
Soon they spotted a familiar, tree-covered island and the glow of lights at the relative's house.
"As we rode ashore, winter gave one departing roar and the river answered with a sliver of sound that must have pierced the stars," she wrote. "That ripped all my fantasy apart and I looked forward to warming my feet over the hot air register."
I have one other account of winter sleighing in the 1920s that my father wrote. In the program for a 1977 Christmas concert at the United Methodist Church of Auburn, he described the heavy, two-horse farm sleds often used for evening hay rides. They were 18 to 20 feet long with double runners. Two-foot-high sideboards served as windbreaks, and the riders were further protected from the cold by the hay and "buffalo robes."
Up front was "the box," a combination seat for the driver and carry-all for feed and tools, including a hammer, to knock snowballs out of the horses' hooves.
The sleds had no brakes. Horses had to run downhill or hold back in their "breeching" to control the sled. Steep hills called for "bridle chains" around a runner to create more drag.
My father wrote that songs soon rose from the riders ... ballads, Stephen Foster, gospel and the full gamut of pre-jazz folk songs.
If toes chilled, it was off the sled to "train," an old term for rough and tumble frolic.
"By the last mile, the mood hushed to stargazing, and finally the party was warmed by hot oyster stew at the Grange hall," he said. "Then it was 'Seeing Nellie Home' in your own one-horse sleigh."

Full text:   BRISTOL -- Every American kid knows the story of Thanksgiving, as told and retold in elementary schools across the land.
There's the Mayflower, the Pilgrims, the winter of hardship, the helpful American Indians and the triumphant and thankful meal at the end of that first year. The story has become part of the national mythology, and influences what we think about the nation's founding.
In Maine, we have our own tale of Colonial-era suffering and woe that is leavened with cruel villainy, a heroic rescue by the Passamaquoddy Indians, and maybe a miracle or two. Hardly anyone knows this story, and some Mainers think it's time for that to change.
The action began in Northern Ireland in July 1741, when a group of about 200 Scots-Irish Presbyterians boarded a brigantine, or snow, called the Martha & Eliza. They were bound for North Carolina by way of Philadelphia, in search of economic opportunity and religious freedom from the Church of England, and no doubt sailed from the old world with hope in their hearts about the new lives they could make in America. Times had been tough in Ireland after a volcanic eruption in the late 1730s created a mini ice age, in which winter stayed for two years, freezing the River Shannon solid. The group sailed under an emigration scheme that likely was called "the Grand Design," according to musician and self-taught historian Julia Lane, who lives in the Lincoln County village of Round Pond.
Lane, half of the musical duo Castlebay, said that she first discovered the tale of the Martha & Eliza as she pored through an old local history book in search of folk songs and ballads.
"It's a hugely dark story," Lane said this week. "I just kept following this trail. I felt it was important for people to understand this sort of underreported time in history and give us a perspective about the development of New England and the attitudes of New England."
According to Lane, the hopeful emigrants didn't know that the ship captain and the landowners who wanted them to come to North Carolina were anxious to shake them down for all the money they could get. That, combined with a fierce hurricane season in the North Atlantic, meant that the ship and its passengers were doomed.
After about three weeks at sea, the passengers were struck down by a serious illness which proved fatal for many. Then, after surviving a hurricane which disabled the masts and swept the ship off course for weeks, the Martha & Eliza foundered in late autumn near an island with sand beaches and high cliffs.
Although often-cited historian had placed the wreck of a ship he called the Grand Design at Ship Harbor on Mount Desert Island, where residents put up a commemorative plaque in the early 1900s. Lane found that this was wrong.
"They weren't looking at the really early documents," Lane said.
She did, and determined that the passengers landed on either Grand Manan or White Head Island in the Bay of Fundy off the coast of Washington County.
Lane also found documents that said Capt. Matthew Rowan was a scoundrel. Two survivors wrote the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony from Maine, begging for help. They said the shipwreck survivors scrounged for clams on the island after being abandoned by Rowan and the crew. When the captain finally returned -- mostly to salvage the goods off the boat, Lane said -- a large group of men had disappeared on a quest for help. Some women had gone farther afield in search of more food, and he left them behind without a search. He did take a group of 48 hungry, debilitated survivors to St. George, where he took their clothes, goods and money before leaving them to the mercy of the villagers.
Meanwhile, the women left behind faced extreme privations, including hunger, cold, death, despair and fear of the Indians. But fate had tossed them on the shore of an island that is sacred to the Passamaquoddy, the people of the dawn. John Bear Mitchell, a lecturer in Wabanaki studies at the University of Maine, said that Grand Manan features prominently in the Passamaquoddy creation story. Dawn, the daughter of the sea and sky deities, was chased to sea by wolves and became the island.
"It's believed to this day by Wabanaki men and women that that island has the spirit of Dawn in it because it is her," Mitchell said Wednesday. "Men will go out there and do their first hunt. Women do after-winter ceremonies there."
In the spring of 1741, Passamaquoddy hunters were shocked when they paddled to the island for their hunt and heard an English voice -- a mother carrying an infant. When they learned the 10 or so women had survived all winter on food they literally pulled from the rocks - edible seaweed and shellfish such as clams, periwinkles and mussels, they were astounded.
"They knew the only way [they] survived was for Dawn to take care of them and the baby," Mitchell said.
Instead of bringing the women to the closer French settlement and ransoming them there, the Passamaquoddy hunters decided to bring a letter to the nearest English settlement.
"That they would travel over 100 miles in an open boat, risking their lives on the women's behalf, is even more remarkable," Lane said.
A ship from St. George went to Grand Manan to pick up the last survivors, bringing them back. Many stayed, Lane said, not wanting to risk anything else in the name of adventure. They married local men and put down deep roots in Maine. It's said that the women from the shipwreck kept a good relationship with the local Indians, according to Lane.
"There was a huge prejudice against the Indians. But the people they trusted -- the landowners, the captain, they let them down," she said. "The people who rescued them were the Indians."
Mitchell said people can learn a lot from the stories of positive interactions between Europeans and Indians, like the story of the rescue of the women from the Martha & Eliza, instead of concentrating on the myths of settlement and conquering.
"Focusing on positive interactions is sort of like Thanksgiving," he said. "It refocuses Thanksgiving from Pilgrims and Indians to family time. We're taking care of people. As humans, this is what we do, and this is what we should be doing."

(Page One Headline - Extra Edition - Lewiston Evening Journal) PRESIDENT KENNEDY SLAIN BY ASSASSIN IN DALLAS - President John F. Kennedy, thirty-sixth president of the United States, was shot to death today by a hidden assassin armed with a high-powered rifle. Kennedy, 46, lived about an hour after a sniper cut him down as his limousine left downtown Dallas. Automatically, the mantle of the presidency fell to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, a native Texan who had been riding two cars behind the chief executive.
25 years ago, 1988
(Feature story about Kennedy visit to Lewiston in 1960) Twenty-eight years ago on a bone-chilling November night, the young presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, three hours late and exhausted from hundreds of miles of campaigning, climbed the bandstand at the then-called Lewiston City Park and addressed a frenzied crowd of admirers. "I think anybody who heard him speak was touched," said Mae Parker, a party worker and retired shoe-shop laborer who was there that night. "He had a way of making you believe everything he said." It is 25 years ago today that Kennedy was slain in Dallas.

Full text:   LEWISTON -- Senior Research Scientist Dr. Jose Antonio Fernandez-Robledo of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay will be the presenter at the USM Lewiston-Auburn Senior College "Food for Thought" 11:30 a.m. luncheon on Friday, Nov. 8.
Dr. Jose Fernandez-Robledo
Fernandez-Robledo is an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and holds a PhD from the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. His topic is ""The oyster parasite Perkinsus Marinus: an unexpected link between oysters and malaria"
Fernandez-Robledo's current research focuses on two fronts; one is the study of "Dermo" disease (caused by the parasite Perkinsus Marinus), which has devastated natural and farmed oyster populations in the United States, significantly affecting the shellfish industry and the estuarine environment. These parasites are distributed world-wide and, in some cases, the gradual expansion of their geographic distribution has been associated with global warming and shellfish trade.
The second aspect of his research is focused on the genetic study between the Dermo disease parasite and its common ancestor found in the parasites of human and veterinary relevance (e.g. Malaria, Toxoplasmosis). Fernandez-Robledo's research methodology involves the use of a combination of molecular tools to address a range of questions about host-parasite interactions, identification of new drug targets for intervention against the oyster disease, and the applications of marine protozoan to biomedicine and biotechnology. These include the development of the oyster parasite into a platform for vaccine delivery against malaria and the screening of compound libraries active against parasites.
Malaria is a potentially lethal infectious disease which has afflicted people for much of human history. Although the disease is not prevalent in the United States, it remains a major public health problem, causing 250 million cases of fever and approximately one million deaths annually. Since the discovery of the Malaria parasite, attention has focused on its biology. Thus, an understanding of the genetic relationship with the oyster parasite is key to new drug targets for intervention against the oyster disease, as well as potential vaccine delivery against Malaria.
Fernandez-Robledo will also touch on other aspects of the laboratory's overall mission, which is the advancement of society's understanding of the interactions between marine ecosystems and the environment, through research and education.
Senior College, now in its 15th year, presents the monthly 11:30 luncheon program in the Function Room 170 at USM LAC. The cost, which includes lunch, is $7 with advance reservation or $8 at the door. Reservations must be made by noon on Thursday, Nov. 7, by calling 753-6510. Any late callers will be considered "at the door."

Concern grows over Asian crab's spread in Maine

Full text:   PORTLAND (AP) -- A species of invasive crab with a voracious appetite that first showed up in the United States 25 years ago has spread to far eastern Maine, and marine ecologists are worried about its potential impact on the environment.
A group of four marine ecology students at the University of Maine at Machias found an Asian shore crab last week while on a field trip to Great Wass Island, in Beals.
The crabs were first recorded in the United States in 1988 in Cape May, N.J., said Brian Beal, a marine ecology professor at the university. The previous northernmost sighting had been on Maine's Schoodic Peninsula, about 30 miles southwest of Great Wass Island.
Asian shore crabs aren't as much of a menace as the invasive green crab, which are larger and have cleaned out some clam flats in parts of southern and midcoast Maine.
But Beal said they could outmuscle other species for food and space, posing a threat to a variety of marine organisms that live in intertidal zones, including periwinkles, clams, worms and seaweed.
"You know in some way it'll change the ecosystem through its new interactions with both plants and animals," Beal said. "Before it arrives, the system is what it is. But after it arrives, it is changed by the presence of this invader."
The body of an Asian crab is just a couple of inches wide with a mottled shell that ranges from green to purple to orange-brown. The crab's native range runs roughly from North Korea to Hong Kong, said Larry Harris, a marine biologist at the University of New Hampshire.
After the crab's arrival in New Jersey, most likely in a ship's ballast, they rapidly moved north to southern New England waters. They have spread more slowly through the colder waters of the Gulf of Maine, but Harris said they can tolerate the cold and will probably make their way to Labrador, north of Newfoundland in Canada.
"It's not surprising they're showing up in eastern Maine, but it's happening faster than we were expecting," he said. "It's because of the mild winters, I think."
There's not a lot of evidence that shows the crabs are altering the intertidal ecology in any great way, Harris said, but they could end up posing a threat to oyster farms or possibly reduce the population of barnacles.
"The jury's still out on that," he said.

Maine's 2012 seafood harvest worth record $528M; haul by weight was largest since 1950

Abstract: Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher cautioned that the high overall value of last year's harvest doesn't mean fishermen are getting rich. Lobster harvesters suffered under the lowest prices since 1994, while all fishermen contended with high prices for fuel, bait and supplies, he said. Maine's seafood catch in 2011, the latest year for which federal nationwide statistics are available, was the No. 3 fishing state in terms of value of seafood caught, behind Alaska and Massachusetts. It accounted for roughly 8 percent of the total value of the U.S. seafood harvest.

Full text:   PORTLAND (AP) -- Maine's seafood harvest topped half a billion dollars for the first time as fishermen had the second-largest haul by weight since 1950, according to preliminary 2012 statistics released by the Department of Marine Resources.
For the year, fishermen harvested 318 million pounds of fish, shellfish and other marine species valued at $527.7 million.
The value of the harvest shatters the previous one-year best of $456.8 million in 2010, according to DMR statistics. The 318 million-pound haul is the largest on record since 1950, when the catch topped 356 million pounds.
Some fishermen fared particularly well in 2012, most notably fishermen who catch baby eels, known as elvers. With prices reaching $2,000 a pound or more, harvesters got $38.7 million for their catch. That was a fivefold increase over a year earlier, when the catch was worth less than $8 million.
But Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher cautioned that the high overall value of last year's harvest doesn't mean fishermen are getting rich. Lobster harvesters suffered under the lowest prices since 1994, while all fishermen contended with high prices for fuel, bait and supplies, he said.
"In some areas, where they can't make up for the low prices in volume, they're barely making it," Keliher said.
Lobster was Maine's top fishery for the year by far, with a record 127 million-pound catch valued at a record $341 million. Lobster accounted for 65 percent of the value of the total catch for the year.
Elvers came in at No. 2, while soft-shell clams were the third-most-valuable fishery, at $15.6 million. Herring, with a value of nearly $15 million, was the No. 4 fishery, while groundfish -- cod, haddock and other bottom-dwelling fish -- rounded out the top 5.
Other valuable species included sea urchins at $5 million, bloodworms at $4.9 million, scallops at $3.2 million and tuna at $2.2 million.
Maine's seafood catch in 2011, the latest year for which federal nationwide statistics are available, was the No. 3 fishing state in terms of value of seafood caught, behind Alaska and Massachusetts. It accounted for roughly 8 percent of the total value of the U.S. seafood harvest.

Greedy green crabs overtake Maine clam flats

Abstract: If the crabs are left unchecked, there might not be a viable clam-digging industry in a couple of years, longtime clam digger Chad Coffin of Freeport said at a news conference along the shore of this town 15 miles north of Portland. Soft-shell clams were Maine's third most-valuable seafood species last year. Green crabs are native to Europe, dark brown to dark mottled green in color with shells up to 4 inches across. They first arrived in New England in the 1800s, most likely in a sailing ship's ballast water, and were first spotted in Maine waters in 1900. They have since spread along much of the East Coast and migrated to the West Coast. Maine has two native crab species, Jonah and rock crabs, that are caught for their meat, but green crabs have little meat and aren't fished commercially.

Full text:   FREEPORT (AP) -- Voracious green crabs are overtaking hundreds if not thousands of acres of mudflats along the Maine coast, cleaning out soft-shell clams and posing a threat to other shellfish, officials said Wednesday.
Prompted by the invasion of the crabs, the Department of Marine Resources this week oversaw a one-day coastwide survey to gauge the abundance of the crabs and provide a snapshot of the population. About 40 volunteers in 30 coastal towns set baited traps Tuesday and pulled them Wednesday.
The results will be used to raise public awareness and help towns develop plans to control them.
If the crabs are left unchecked, there might not be a viable clam-digging industry in a couple of years, longtime clam digger Chad Coffin of Freeport said at a news conference along the shore of this town 15 miles north of Portland. Soft-shell clams were Maine's third most-valuable seafood species last year.
"If you like clams, you're in trouble. There might not be any," said Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association.
Green crabs are native to Europe, dark brown to dark mottled green in color with shells up to 4 inches across. They first arrived in New England in the 1800s, most likely in a sailing ship's ballast water, and were first spotted in Maine waters in 1900. They have since spread along much of the East Coast and migrated to the West Coast.
Maine has two native crab species, Jonah and rock crabs, that are caught for their meat, but green crabs have little meat and aren't fished commercially.
Although they've been a nuisance on-and-off through the decades, green crab numbers have grown fast in the past few years, most likely because of warming ocean waters, officials say. Their populations have also been growing in their entire East Coast range from Virginia to Newfoundland.
There are so many of the crabs in nearshore waters, particularly in Casco Bay and the midcoast areas, that they've cleaned out entire clam flats and are thought to have decimated mussel populations as well, Coffin said.
They are a significant threat to the state's $15 million clam industry, as well as to mussels, scallops and other shellfish, said Marine Resources Commissioner Pat Keliher.
"Green crabs are the No. 1 threat to that portion of our coastal economy," he said.
The crabs could also pose a threat to juvenile lobsters and have damaged eelgrass beds, which provide important habitat for marine species.
The results of the survey haven't been tallied, but one survey volunteer found 104 to 126 crabs in each of the four modified lobster traps he pulled out of the water Wednesday, said Brian Beal, a marine ecology professor at the University of Maine-Machias who has studied clams for nearly three decades.
Efforts are underway in the private sector to come up with a way to make green crabs commercially valuable, either as lobster bait, an aquaculture feed, a compost supplement or a food additive. But until that happens, the Department of Marine Resources says, the most effective way to eradicate them and contain their spread is by trapping them and using fencing to keep them out of productive shellfish areas.
Better yet, the population could be knocked down with a lot of ice and cold, Keliher said. Maine's green crab population surged in the 1950s when ocean temperature rose, but the trend reversed itself in the 1960s when cold winters returned.
"The best thing we can hope for is that the Farmers' Almanac is right and we get a cold, hard winter," Keliher said.

Lobster shell disease inching into Gulf of Maine

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]15 Aug 2013.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1424271327?accountid=10457

Abstract: David Cousens, president of Maine Lobstermen's Association, said Thursday he's not overly concerned about shell disease becoming more prevalent off the Maine coast, as long as the water temperature in the gulf stays cool. Water in the gulf of Maine was abnormally warm in 2012, which led lobsters to molt unusually early, but this year so far the water at depths where lobsters live, several meters down, have been in the typical 50-degree Fahrenheit range. "I'm concerned, obviously, but not panicked," Cousens said. "I don't think (this increase) is anything to worry about." "There supposedly is some creep in the southern range of the Maine coast and the New Hampshire coast," [Joseph Kunkel] said Tuesday. "I'm not convinced by the numbers yet."

Full text:   ELLSWORTH -- It is not like southern New England, where as much as a third of lobsters have been affected in recent years, but fishermen and scientists say there are signs that lobster shell disease is increasing in the Gulf of Maine.
Water temperatures in the gulf historically have been colder than the coastal waters south of Cape Cod and have fostered a greater degree of marine biodiversity than other parts of the East Coast. The gulf is where the vast majority of American lobster is caught, with a record amount of more than 126 million pounds of lobster brought ashore in 2012 by Maine fishermen who cumulatively earned nearly $339 million for their catch.
The lobster population south of Cape Cod has not fared well in recent decades, and the spread of lobster shell disease along the southern New England coast during that time has been one of the problems the crustaceans have faced. Increased water temperatures, pesticides, ocean acidification and other types of runoff have been cited as possible factors in the decline of the southern New England lobster population.
In the Gulf of Maine, instances of shell disease historically have been rare -- maybe one or two cases for every 10,000 lobsters, according to scientists. This year, however, there have been more reports about lobsters with the disease being caught in the gulf, though the apparent increased rate of occurrence still lags far behind the disease's frequency south of Cape Cod.
The disease manifests when naturally occurring bacteria consume the shells of living lobsters, making the lobsters unsightly and possibly weak but still safe to eat. Though the lobster meat is unaffected in appearance and flavor, the disease can depress the value of Maine's lobster fishery catch because the scars and lesions on affected animals make them unsuitable for the lucrative restaurant market.
Why some lobsters are affected by the bacteria and others are not is unknown. Scientists have debated whether water temperature, relative acidity, food availability and population density might be factors. Some scientists believe something internal in the lobster -- its genetic makeup, a pre-existing condition or another type of stress -- could trigger the disease, but they have not come up with an answer.
"We have yet to figure out what that weakness is," Bob Bayer, executive director of the Lobster Institute at the University of Maine, said Thursday. "It's so hard to know."
Bayer said scientists have been interested in finding out the cause of shell disease for "well over 20 years." Researchers have been unable to transmit the disease from one lobster to another so, though it can be fatal, it is not contagious, Bayer said.
Lobsters seem to rid themselves of the disease when they molt and shed their shells, which grow back without any trace of pitting or rot, he added, but the same lobster can contract it again. Egg-bearing females, which retain their hardened shells longer than other lobsters, are most susceptible to the disease.
Attempts this week to contact scientists with the Maine Department of Marine Resources, which has kept tabs on reports of shell disease off the Maine coast, were unsuccessful.
Bayer said he does not have statistics for how prevalent the disease might be in Maine, but he guessed 1-2 percent of the lobster population in the gulf may be affected. He said he knows it has increased because the institute has been receiving noticeably more photographs, emails and phone calls this summer from Maine fishermen who have found affected lobsters in their traps.
"It's not massive numbers," Bayer said, compared to what has been reported in the past decade off the coasts of Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts.
David Cousens, president of Maine Lobstermen's Association, said Thursday he's not overly concerned about shell disease becoming more prevalent off the Maine coast, as long as the water temperature in the gulf stays cool. Water in the gulf of Maine was abnormally warm in 2012, which led lobsters to molt unusually early, but this year so far the water at depths where lobsters live, several meters down, have been in the typical 50-degree Fahrenheit range.
According to Cousens, the frequency of shell disease among lobsters in the gulf has increased in the past couple of years from two or three in 1,000 to about six in 1,000.
"I'm concerned, obviously, but not panicked," Cousens said. "I don't think (this increase) is anything to worry about."
Cousens said he believes water temperature is a factor, because it is the kind of environmental factor that could put added stress on lobsters, which prefer relatively cold water. The bacteria is always in the water column, he said, and last year's temperature increase in the gulf could have been a trigger for the comparatively higher rate of shell disease.
"(Lobsters) only get it when they are stressed," Cousens said.
Joseph Kunkel, a research professor at University of New England, said Tuesday that he is hesitant to read too much significance into the reports he has heard of lobster shell disease creeping into the gulf. The sample size for the numbers of affected lobsters found in the Gulf of Maine is so small, he said, that a small pocket of diseased lobsters could skew the estimates for how prevalent the disease is.
"There supposedly is some creep in the southern range of the Maine coast and the New Hampshire coast," Kunkel said Tuesday. "I'm not convinced by the numbers yet."
Still, if the numbers have increased from, say, 0.1 percent to 0.3 or 0.6 percent, he added, it would be a cause for concern. What has happened in southern New England is quite serious, he said.
"But we're far away from that now (in the gulf)," he said. "That's something we want to avoid."
Kunkel said relative acidity levels or pollution in the ocean could act as a trigger for activating shell disease among some lobsters. He said he thinks the vulnerability of lobsters after they shed their old shells but before their new ones harden may play a role.
"There's no smoking gun yet, and there are a lot of opinions," Kunkel said.
Bayer and Kunkel each said that there should be more funding devoted to researching shell disease, so that a cause can be determined before it might become a major concern in the Gulf of Maine. Bayer added that the Lobster Institute hopes to conduct a survey of lobstermen this fall to get more data on the presence of the disease along the Maine coast.
"We may see less as the season progresses," Bayer said. "It's hard to know what is going to happen."

"It's hard to make the assumption at this point." "We've always sort of dismissed green crabs interacting with lobsters because they have pretty much disappeared at a 25-foot depth along coastal Maine," he said.

Full text:   FREEPORT -- Clammer Clint Goodenow motored his skiff up to a small, white buoy in the Harraseeket River Monday afternoon and began pulling up yards of rope from the bay floor below.
After reaching the end of the rope, he leaned over the side of the boat and plunged his hands into the water, grabbing hold of a black metal trap. In what appeared to be a delicate balance, Goodenow heaved the trap into the small boat, positioned it above a gray rectangular storage container, and flipped open the latch at the bottom.
Dozens of European green crabs crashed into the container -- some one or two inches across, others five or six. He then pounded the top and sides of the trap to knock loose the remaining crabs.
Three traps later, the 100-pound container was brimming with crabs. Some attempted to spring loose, but were quickly snatched up and shut in with a lid.
Goodenow, who is part of the largest effort in the state's history to study the decline of shellfish populations, describes the swarms of crabs he has seen in the last few years like something from a horror movie.
"They just boil out of the water," he said.
In recent years, clammers say the rapid growth of the green crabs along sections of Maine's coast has ravaged shellfish populations, particularly mussels and soft-shell clams.
There is concern now that even Maine's lobster industry may be at risk.
The crabs, previously held at bay by long, cold winters, have swelled in numbers in the past couple decades due to rising water temperatures that no longer keep their populations in check.
The Freeport-funded project now has more than a month of work under its belt, stewarded by town clammers and lobstermen at the direction of scientists. And while the project has a focus on green crabs, it will also gather and analyze data on the impact of other factors believed to be contributing to the decline of clam populations: ocean acidification, which dissolves clam shells, and disease.
Researchers and fishermen hope the study can find an effective method to reduce the impact of the crab infestation. If they don't, they believe it could spell the end of the state's $25 million fishery and be disastrous for the coast's ecosystem.
"We've been so spoiled in the past and didn't do anything," said Chad Coffin, president of Maine Clammers Association, noting that he first noticed green crabs in 2007. "That's when I first started piecing it together, but I didn't understand how bad it really is."
Freeport Town Manager Peter Joseph said clammers working on the project, which involves not only trapping, but fencing off of certain areas, are hauling in about 400 pounds of crabs every three days.
He said the town hopes the nearly $70,000 study will shed light on how to deter green crabs in a way that can be replicated by other towns.
"All marine resources are connected out there, so what benefits us, benefits everybody," Joseph said.
Kohl Kanwit, public health bureau director for the Department of Natural Resources, said while the disappearance of clams could be caused by a number of factors, green crabs in Casco Bay pose a "huge problem."
In a recent tour of Freeport's tidal flats with Coffin and state biologist Pete Thayer, Kanwit said the crab invasion seems to have reached a new level.
"It was shocking to see the numbers of crabs at low tide up under the marsh, burrowed up under the grass," she said, referring to the salt grass that lines much of the Harraseeket River. "It's unbelievable how many are there."
Kanwit said in recent years clam predators like green crabs and the moon snail have completely shut down commercial harvesting in the once productive clamming area of Northern Bay in Penobscot.
"(Penobscot clammers) tried to resolve their problems by removing the moon snails and they were fairly successful with that, until green crabs moved in," she said. "The entire flat has no clams anymore, at least not anything anyone can commercially dig."
Although the crabs are known for eating the juvenile clams, also known as spat, Kanwit said she found "fairly large clams" at entrances to the Freeport flats with chips taken out of their edges, suggesting that some crabs have moved on to larger prey.
Right now, the crabs' favorite meals are clams, but Coffin warns other species, including the Maine's most sacred seafood, may be at risk.
"(The crabs) food preference has systematically moved through all of shellfish resources on a sequence based on convenience," he said, noting that predation has killed off most of the scallops and mussels, and has now moved onto clams. "When the clams are gone, what are they going to eat? People may think lobsters are big and tough, but they're not."
Kanwit said in lab tests pitting lobsters against green crabs, the crabs have dominated. They don't have evidence of this phenomenon in the wild yet, she said, but lobstermen are reporting catching green crabs in deeper water than they have ever seen.
"It's potentially logical that it might be happening," Kanwit said of green crabs preying on lobsters. "It's hard to make the assumption at this point."
Richard Wahle, a University of Maine professor who studies marine life in New England, said finding the crabs in deeper water is a disturbing development.
"We've always sort of dismissed green crabs interacting with lobsters because they have pretty much disappeared at a 25-foot depth along coastal Maine," he said. "Seeing green crabs in deeper water does open the possibility of green crabs interacting more with lobsters. That's something to be concerned about."
Another alarming result of the green crab invasion is the erosion of salt grass, an important stabilizing plant, along the river banks, said Brian Beal, a professor at the University of Maine at Machias and lead researcher of the Freeport project.
"The salt grass dying. There's maybe two or three feet of dead sod," he said. "It's getting ravaged."
Beal, who has studied green crabs since the 1980s, said the only evidence he's seen of this kind of erosion is in a photo from the 1950s that hangs on his office wall. A marine warden stands in the marsh with hatchet he used to chop away the dead sod that had been eroded by the crabs.
Back then, water temperatures soared, creating a fertile environment that fostered a surge of green crabs eerily similar to the one today. The crabs devastated clam populations until a severe cold snap settled in during the 1960s, effectively killing them off and allowing shellfish to return.
The concern now is that extreme increase in water temperatures is not part of cyclical process, but an unnatural phenomenon, said Wahle, who published a paper in late June about water temperature's impact on lobsters.
One of the most serious threats thought to be caused by the warming temperatures is shell disease, he said, noting that in the last few years they've seen a ten-fold increase in parts of Maine.
And while relatively long-term impacts of climate change can seem abstract, Coffin, who has been ringing the alarm about green crabs for several years, said their impact as a result of a changing climate is something that can be seen immediately.
Now, he said, clammers and lobstermen in other towns, who at first dismissed the problem, are beginning to pay attention.
"The full effect could take 20 years," Coffin said. "But it's going to happen unless we can do something and start fighting back."

Full text:   MACHIASPORT -- With the recent acquisition of a local waterfront property, officials hope that ancient shorefront markings at the site will be preserved for generations to come.
Maine Coast Heritage Trust announced last week that it has acquired a 66-acre property at Long Point on Machias Bay that includes 3,000-year-old petroglyphs carved into waterfront rocks. The petroglyphs are believed to have been carved into the rock by Wabanaki people, who were the indigenous precursor to Maine's modern Indian tribes.
The markings at Long Point are similar to other ancient Wabanaki petroglyphs found elsewhere along the shore in eastern Maine, including the Picture Rocks site at Birch Point on the far side of the mouth of the Machias River. That property also was conserved as part of a project involving MCHT and the Passamaquoddy Tribe in 2006.
Patrick Watson, project manager for MCHT, said this week that the group had a one-year option on the Long Point property that was coming to a close. Before MCHT acquired the option, a developer unsuccessfully sought to create a 26-lot subdivision on the peninsula property.
Watson said MCHT is looking to raise $1.1 million to cover the cost of acquiring and managing the property, which will be publicly accessible. He said the trust hopes to put in a parking lot and a few trails so that people can enjoy activities at the site such as bird-watching, hiking or shellfish harvesting.
Access to the petroglyphs on the property is expected to be limited to Passamaquoddy tribal and research functions, MCHT officials said.
In a prepared statement released by MCHT, University of Maine associate professor of anthropology Brian Robinson said the project is significant for protecting the cultural history of the region. Since this spring, Robinson has been involved in archaeological research of a shell midden on the property.
"Long Point holds important insight into the rich heritage of the Wabanaki, and particularly for understanding the cultural landscape of the petroglyphs that link Machias Bay and broader cultural regions," Robinson said in the statement. "Conservation of Long Point brings recognition to the depth of these relationships."
Donald Soctomah, historic preservation officer for the Passamaquoddy Tribe, indicated that MCHT's acquisition of the property is a welcome development for the tribe.
"There is something very spiritual about the petroglyphs. They represent our people's history and stories of our culture," Soctomah said in the MCHT statement. "We are very pleased to know that this sacred site has been spared from development."

Abstract: The town is accepting resumes for a new part-time code enforcement officer after Paul Montague chose to resign from that portion of his job. The town will save some money, mostly from the benefit package, but will have to get used to code enforcement only being available one day a week, she said. Montague will provide backup for some smaller code enforcement issues, she added. Montague said he chose to resign partially because he's not happy with the Maine Unified Building Code and can't agree with it. He's also involved with the care of a parent.

Full text:   WILTON -- The town is accepting resumes for a new part-time code enforcement officer after Paul Montague chose to resign from that portion of his job.
Montague will continue working 24 hours per week as a part-time counter person at the town office, Town Manager Rhonda Irish said.
Resumes for the Code Enforcement/Licensed Plumbing Inspector position should be submitted by July 12, she said.
Years ago, the two part-time positions, code enforcement officer and counter person, were combined, providing a full-time (37 hour) position with benefits, Irish said.
Now that Montague wants to resign from just code enforcement, the two positions have become part-time again with no benefits.
The town will save some money, mostly from the benefit package, but will have to get used to code enforcement only being available one day a week, she said. Montague will provide backup for some smaller code enforcement issues, she added.
The code enforcement officer is also involved with the town's Planning Board. A description of the position is available at the town office or online at www.wiltonmaine.org under "town government."
Montague started working part-time for the town in 2005. He became full-time with the melding of the two positions in 2006, she said.
Montague said he chose to resign partially because he's not happy with the Maine Unified Building Code and can't agree with it. He's also involved with the care of a parent.
The Montagues moved here when his wife, Edna, became Director of the Sweatt-Winter Child Care and Early Education Center at the University of Maine at Farmington.
Previously, he worked as a shellfish constable in Cape Cod for one of largest shellfish hatcheries on the East Coast, he said.
He then worked in Yarmouth and Falmouth.
Montague became involved in Code Enforcement because of his law enforcement experience, especially in regard to enforcing environmental law, he said.
Now, he'll continue registering cars and dogs, he said.

Abstract: "I just love being in the water in the kelp beds," said [Tom Roth]. "It's phenomenally beautiful when you get to see the kelp swaying back and forth in the tides. The colors of the different kelps. It's just an amazing thing to see." "The health benefits of kelp are astronomical," Roth said. "All the sea vegetables are very high in iron, magnesium, zinc, iodine -- the nori has a lot of the B vitamins that you need, amino acids. It's a powerhouse." "People say, 'You work hard.' And I say, 'Well, when you love what you do, it's not even considered work.' And that's how I feel about it," Roth said. "It's a great industry to be involved in. It's definitely the future."

Full text:   His head disappeared beneath the water as he followed the frond of kelp to the ocean floor. With a knife, Tom Roth sliced through the base of the plant, then resurfaced, spewing water from his snorkel.
To learn about VitaminSea visit vitaminseaseaweed.com. To learn more about Maine seaweed, visit the Maine Seaweed Council website at maineseaweed.org.
"Sometimes he'll get a big piece and yell 'Woohoo,'" said Eric Lund of Saco while rowing a raft through a kelp bed off the shore of Cape Elizabeth. Lund was looking for a spot to hop overboard and help his boss, Roth, with the last sugar kelp harvest of the season.
Sea algae is the key ingredient in SeaCrunch, a gluten-free bar made of almonds, sesame seeds, cranberries, maple syrup and kelp that Roth created.
The energy bar is one of the newest seaweed-based products his growing company VitaminSea Seaweed in Scarborough, produces and markets to health food stores throughout New England.
Roth began harvesting Maine seaweed seven years ago, initially to pay for the construction of a red skiff.
"We started off with our first order of two little 40-pound bags [of rockweed]," said Roth, who sold the seaweed to lobster co-ops for packing lobsters and shellfish. "That developed into 200 bags a week in a matter of a month."
A commercial fisherman for 28 years, Roth decided to sell his two fishing boats and invest in the seaweed industry. He joined the Maine Seaweed Council, did his research, and began developing seaweed-based products.
"I just love being in the water in the kelp beds," said Roth. "It's phenomenally beautiful when you get to see the kelp swaying back and forth in the tides. The colors of the different kelps. It's just an amazing thing to see."
To reflect the nutritional value of their products, Roth and his wife, Kelly, named their company VitaminSea.
Maine's maritime medley
To seaweed harvesters, the term "seaweed" is rather general.
Roth harvests a wide variety of seaweed, starting with sugar kelp in late March, when air temperatures off the southern Maine coast can dip into the teens.
"The water is still 35-38 [degrees], but it's pretty cold," he said.
March through May, he spends his time swimming through sugar kelp beds off Cape Elizabeth, Harpswell, Boothbay and Peaks Island.
"I just kick out my legs and the kelp wraps around them, then I follow it down to its base," Roth said. He cuts each frond carefully, leaving the holdfast, or root, so the plant can regenerate. Sugar kelp can grow several feet in a matter of months. It is, after all, a weed.
Snails, starfish and sea urchins start feeding on the kelp when the water warms up in May, and the kelp begins changing color when it's past its prime.
By then, it's time for Roth to focus his energy on other sea vegetables, such as rockweed, Irish moss, bright green sea lettuce, dulse and oarweed, all of which keep him and his two employees busy until November.
'Sea-licious' and nutritious
"If you would have told me 10 years ago to eat seaweed, I would have looked at you and said, 'It's not happening,'" Roth said. Yet today, he incorporates seaweed into his everyday meals.
"It's grown on me," he said.
Among the many VitaminSea products is the Roth's cookbook, "Simply Sea-Licious," which introduces people to cooking with sea vegetables.
"The health benefits of kelp are astronomical," Roth said. "All the sea vegetables are very high in iron, magnesium, zinc, iodine -- the nori has a lot of the B vitamins that you need, amino acids. It's a powerhouse."
Each sea vegetable has something slightly different to offer in taste and nutrition.
"Here in the United States, there's such a small amount of sea vegetables being consumed, where in other parts of the world, it's a staple," Roth said.
Roth harvests and sells whole leaf as well as flaked kombu, wakame and nori, three types of seaweed that are key ingredients in Japanese cuisine and provide nutrients that are essential to overall health.
A sea of possibilities
In less than a decade, VitaminSea has expanded to offer about 30 seaweed-based products, from a 0.25-pound bag of Irish moss, an edible thickening agent for things such as beer and ice cream for $6, to a 30-pound bag of rockweed for $65.
In addition to a wide variety of whole leaf, flaked and granulated sea vegetables, they offer simple "Sea-sonings" (such as a mixture of dulse, sea salt, kelp and garlic), "SeaNutrients" animal supplements, and liquid seaweed and fish garden food.
"We're finding that they have over a year shelf life because kelp is a natural food preservative," said Roth, who has recently released a second SeaCrunch flavor that includes wild blueberries and dark chocolate.
But seaweed isn't just for eating.
Maine's bladderwrack, a leafy plant with air bladders, is used in making skin care products.
"When you put that in hot water, it releases a gel that is absorbed into your skin so easily. It softens your skin," said Roth. "They're also using it for skin disorders like psoriasis."
Future VitaminSea products may include seaweed-based soap, bath products and natural sunblock.
Then there's always the possibility of seaweed art. Roth recently sent a package of fresh Maine seaweed to New York to be used in a photoshoot.
"I hope they've used fresh digitata (oarweed) before," said Roth. "Because after it warms up, it gets pretty slimy."
Working hard and green
Off Cape Elizabeth, Roth held a 6-foot-long frond of glistening sugar kelp in the air, inspecting its frills before placing it in a round plastic basket, buoyed by an inner tube. Each time he filled the basket, Lund replaced it with an empty one, then unloaded the full basket into the skiff, creating an impressive pile of seaweed in the bow.
"This will be my last basket," Roth yelled to Lund.
"Watch. He'll pile his last basket up enough for two baskets," Lund said. "He loves this."
Later that day, they drove 500 pounds of kelp to a large field in Buxton. Roth's second employee, Eddie Leighton of Biddeford, joined them beneath the bare metal frame of a large greenhouse. There they hung the kelp, strand by strand, to dry in the sun.
Smaller seaweed would have been laid out on 280 mesh tables lined up in a nearby field.
Though VitaminSea is growing and the future looks promising for the seaweed industry, Roth still maintains a secondary job working on a bunker barge moored near the Statue of Liberty. He spends two weeks aboard the barge and two weeks at his home in Buxton working on harvesting and marketing VitaminSea products.
"People say, 'You work hard.' And I say, 'Well, when you love what you do, it's not even considered work.' And that's how I feel about it," Roth said. "It's a great industry to be involved in. It's definitely the future."

Abstract: "You can see something offshore and know what's coming," he said. "We take that for granted with the weather. Imagine that in monitoring these algal blooms." "The offshore waters are a blind spot unless you have something out there telling you what's happening," said [Darcie Couture], who formerly headed Maine's red tide monitoring programming. A robotic device is deployed to detect red tide in the Gulf of Maine. Red tide monitoring is going high-tech with a robotic "laboratory in a can." A garbage can-sized canister was deployed in late April in the ocean waters off southern Maine to collect and transmit data about toxin-producing algae blooms, known as red tides, that show up in the Gulf of Maine each spring.

A garbage can-size canister was deployed in late April in the ocean waters off southern Maine to collect and transmit data about toxin-producing algae blooms, known as red tides, that show up in the Gulf of Maine each spring.
Inside the canister is a pint-size robotic biology lab that extracts organisms from water samples, tests them for DNA and toxins, and transmits real-time data to shore by cellphone. Scientists say the apparatus will transform the way the harmful algal blooms are monitored and allow resource managers to better predict when and where red tide outbreaks might occur.
"This is one of the first steps in a major enhancement of red-tide monitoring," said Don Anderson, a senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Mass., who has overseen development of the device.
One of the contraptions, called an environmental sample processor, was put in the ocean in late April. It'll be taken out in mid-June and replaced by another that will continue taking samples through the rest of the red tide season.
Anderson wants to have four of the processors in the Gulf of Maine next year. In time, he hopes to have a dozen of them at strategic points along the Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts coasts, as well as in Canada's Bay of Fundy and on Georges Bank fishing grounds 60 miles east of Cape Cod.
The monitoring devices cost more than $200,000 each, but the price should come down as the technology is refined, Anderson said. Funding for the project comes from a number of sources, including the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Red tide blooms produce a toxin that clams, mussels and some other shellfish absorb, making them unsafe for humans to eat. In extreme cases, eating tainted shellfish can cause potentially fatal paralytic shellfish poisoning.
In bad years, red tide outbreaks have shut down hundreds of miles of clam flats for weeks at a time in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in losses for clam diggers and other shellfish harvesters.
The new processors are intended to complement, not replace, existing red-tide monitoring programs. State agencies now test for red tide in coastal shellfish areas, but there's never been ongoing testing in waters miles offshore.
Tracking red tide outbreaks using only shoreline testing is like predicting the weather using only weather instruments in your backyard, not knowing about a storm system coming your way, Anderson said. Adding offshore testing for red tide toxins is like adding radar, weather balloons and other sophisticated equipment in forecasting the weather, he said.
"You can see something offshore and know what's coming," he said. "We take that for granted with the weather. Imagine that in monitoring these algal blooms."
Offshore tests will help managers determine when they should be conducting coastline testing, said Darcie Couture, lead scientist at Resource Access International LLC, a Brunswick company that provides private laboratory testing for shellfish. If there aren't any toxins being detected offshore, then there's probably no need to be testing for them close to shore, she said.
The devices will also give managers a heads-up on when and where red tide might strike. In 2005, there was a large red tide bloom in the Gulf that nobody was aware of and that stayed offshore because winds were blowing from the southwest. But when a nor'easter struck, the northeasterly winds blew the red tide to shore, resulting in widespread clam flat closures with little warning.
"The offshore waters are a blind spot unless you have something out there telling you what's happening," said Couture, who formerly headed Maine's red tide monitoring programming.
The new monitoring device is tethered to a buoy on the water surface and to an anchor on the ocean floor. The first one was developed by Chris Scholin, who was once a student of Anderson's while earning a doctorate and is now president and CEO of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research institute in California.
Scholin's first "laboratory in a can," as he called it, was deployed off Maine in 2000. The idea was to find a way to retrieve and test data from the ocean in a timely manner without actually going to sea, he said. Marine research is time-consuming and costly when scientists have to rent vessels with crew, spend days at a time at sea and collect samples that are later tested in on-shore laboratories. By the time the lab results are known, the water conditions may have changed.
Scholin's first device was crude compared to the Anderson's latest version, but it worked. To retrieve the data, he carried an antenna and a large battery in a backpack, and pointed the antenna toward the ocean.
"People thought we were crazy, that it couldn't be done," he said.
Besides red tide, the processor can be used to test for water quality and monitor bacteria, viruses and other organisms in oceans, lakes, rivers, reservoirs and at fish farms. In time, it could be used for commercial applications, such as testing food in food-processing plants.
"They are on the cutting edge of technology, pushing the edge," Scholin said.

Abstract: FALMOUTH - Maine Audubon is looking for volunteers to "lend an ear" and help observe the presence of frogs and toads in their local area. Wood frogs, the Northern Leopard frog and other amphibians are already active in vernal pools and wetlands throughout southern Maine, and will begin activity in the rest of the state within the next week. Frog and toad species make their mating calls for a very short period of time, often less than two weeks. Keynote speaker, Paul Raia, Ph.D., has directed patient care and family support at the Alzheimer's Association for the past 22 years and now serves as vice president of clinical programs at the Alzheimer's Association, MA/NH Chapter. In his keynote address, "Caring for the Person with Dementia: Habilitation Therapy," Raia will discuss habilitation therapy, an approach to dementia care that he developed that focuses on the emotions and remaining capacities of the person with the disease. The Maine Women's Ride is a celebration of women and bicycling. The all-female event offers a friendly, supportive atmosphere geared toward girls and women of all ages and abilities. The routes (10-, 25-, 50- or 75-mile options) follow quiet roads, offering beautiful views of the Maine coast and countryside. All routes will be fully supported with rest stops, mechanical support and SAG wagons. At the ride's conclusion, participants will have the opportunity to receive free massages and participate in yoga. A post ride party will feature free food, discounted beer, music, and door prize drawings.

Austin Bay: Margaret Thatcher: The complete strategic warrior

Abstract: Thatcher had a staunch record as a Cold War warrior and played a key role in the demise of the Soviet Union. In 1982 Falklands War, Argentina's economically desperate military junta made the mistake of testing her. They lost. Thatcher knew that winning the Cold War required confidence, staying power and leaders who could convince the Soviets that aggression in Europe would immediately lead to a shooting war they would not win. During the so-called 1983 Euro-missile Crisis, she provided another lesson. With steely enthusiasm, Thatcher backed NATO's decision to counter the Soviet deployment of 200 SS-20 theater ballistic missiles in Eastern Europe by deploying U.S. missiles in Western Europe. Communist sympathizers and Western "peace" organizations vilified her and Reagan (no good deed goes unpunished), but the NATO deployment ultimately brought the Soviets to the bargaining table. The Greece 2009-Great Britain 1979 analogy isn't perfect, but it is instructive. Thatcher became prime minister in 1979. The Great Britain of 1979 confronted enormous economic and social problems. Listing them is a litany of the dismal: stagnating and declining industries. High (and increasing) public debt loads. Innovation-crushing tax rates and creativity-sapping bureaucratic regulation. Powerful public sector interest groups -- truly vested interests -- opposed to change that would increase economic productivity and create new wealth.

Full text:   Everyone who knows that wealth underwrites all security arrangements should appreciate an unadorned but profoundly reverent epitaph for Margaret Thatcher posted this week on a national defense and military history Internet discussion board: "Without her, England would have become Greece before Greece became Greece."
Her admirer then added, referring to the slanted Thatcher bio pic slapped together in Hollywood, "But no good deed goes unpunished."
Like Ronald Reagan, her Cold War contemporary, history will be very kind to Margaret Thatcher. From the 1980s to the 1990s, European and American leftists used the term "Reagan-Thatcher" as a bivalve curse for warmongering and heartlessness. However, current history is demonstrating the strategic genius and, yes, strategic generosity of both leaders.
Two weeks ago, when North Korea threatened to strike U.S. territory with missiles bearing nuclear warheads, the Obama administration oh so quietly affirmed the necessity of strategic missile defense. Yet for three decades the American left, from which the Obama administration springs, maligned Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) as warmongering, as lunacy, as anything but what it is for contemporary America: an absolutely vital capability we were wise enough and wealthy enough to build. Strategic defense costs lots of money. However, losing Honolulu, Los Angeles or Austin, Texas, would cost substantially more.
Thatcher had a staunch record as a Cold War warrior and played a key role in the demise of the Soviet Union. In 1982 Falklands War, Argentina's economically desperate military junta made the mistake of testing her. They lost. Thatcher knew that winning the Cold War required confidence, staying power and leaders who could convince the Soviets that aggression in Europe would immediately lead to a shooting war they would not win.
Thatcher inspired confidence. She understood the moral and economic sources of staying power (more on her economics in a moment). As for convincing, she convinced by word and deed. Defeating the Argentinian invasion required immediate action, which she took. The Soviets watched, aware that the Iron Lady was giving them a dynamic lesson in what to expect if their tank divisions violated the intra-German border.
During the so-called 1983 Euro-missile Crisis, she provided another lesson. With steely enthusiasm, Thatcher backed NATO's decision to counter the Soviet deployment of 200 SS-20 theater ballistic missiles in Eastern Europe by deploying U.S. missiles in Western Europe. Communist sympathizers and Western "peace" organizations vilified her and Reagan (no good deed goes unpunished), but the NATO deployment ultimately brought the Soviets to the bargaining table.
As for Thatcher's thorough appreciation of the economic source of staying power: She was 20 when World War II ended. It took wealth, a lot of wealth, to create the defense organizations that defeated Adolf Hitler and then shielded the West during the Cold War.
She knew, however, that economic productivity fundamentally affects all other aspects of human social and political life.
Declining economic productivity degrades human social and political life. If you think otherwise, please consider the country Thatcher's military admirer mentioned in his epitaph: Greece.
The Greece 2009-Great Britain 1979 analogy isn't perfect, but it is instructive. Thatcher became prime minister in 1979. The Great Britain of 1979 confronted enormous economic and social problems. Listing them is a litany of the dismal: stagnating and declining industries. High (and increasing) public debt loads. Innovation-crushing tax rates and creativity-sapping bureaucratic regulation. Powerful public sector interest groups -- truly vested interests -- opposed to change that would increase economic productivity and create new wealth.
Her critics, many of them sold on communism's inevitable victory, said this was the best Britain could manage, the new normal. It could not be changed.
She rejected inevitable decline as what it is, an utterly intellectual dishonest defense of the status quo. Thatcher believed that private-sector commercial creativity, when unleashed, would prove to be Britain's greatest natural resource. Printing presses and central banks do not produce wealth. People produce wealth. People had to produce wealth and create value in order for the government to have money to spend -- on anything.
Hence one of Thatcher's favorite quips, "The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money."
Indeed, Greece is learning Margaret Thatcher's quip is no joke. Would that Athens had a leader like her, a prescient, wealth-creating revolutionary. Would that Washington did, as well.

Full text:   SOUTHWEST HARBOR, Maine -- Scallop gonads do not have a reputation as being intrinsically funny, the way banana peels or rubber chickens might.
But when two buckets full of the mollusk innards that are part of a scientific study go missing, and when the police get involved to find out where they may have been taken, there's a chance somebody might try to make a wisecrack about it.
There's also a chance, apparently, that a national cable comedy television show might take an interest.
That's what happened last fall when an incident in which a local scallop fisherman misplaced two buckets of scallop guts made national headlines. "The Colbert Report" on Comedy Central decided to spoof the incident and, with the help of those involved, came to Maine to film a segment on it last month. The segment aired on the cable program on Monday night.
Last Nov. 26, police on Mount Desert Island and in Ellsworth alerted the public that the buckets went missing after the fisherman, Andy Mays, mistakenly put them in the back of the wrong car and the person then drove off, not knowing the bivalve bits were coming along for the ride.
A producer at "The Colbert Report," hosted by comedian Stephen Colbert, saw the headlines and decided the story was too weird to pass up.
"We spend a lot of time on the Internet," show producer Nicole Savini said Monday.
"It seemed very 'Maine.' The unlocked car, the scallop guts."
Mays had been collecting scallops for six months as part of a research project through Darling Marine Center, a University of Maine marine research facility in South Bristol. He had gutted the bivalves, isolated the gonads and stored them in formaldehyde, and made arrangements to deliver them to Skylar Bayer, a grad student at the Darling Center who had agreed to meet him at a Mount Desert Island convenience store.
Mays got to the Somesville One Stop, spotted a parked car with UMaine plates, put the scallops in the vehicle and then went inside the store to find Bayer. She was not there, however, and when he went back outside, the car with the scallop guts wasn't either.
Mays had put the gonads in a blue Chevrolet Impala belonging to the UMaine Motor Pool that Abigail Garthwait, an associate professor at UMaine, had driven to MDI earlier that day. On her way back to the university she stopped at the One Stop to get a bite to eat and, when she left again, failed to notice the buckets in the backseat. It wasn't until around 5 p.m., when she stopped in Orono to fill up with gas, that she saw the two buckets labeled "formaldehyde."
In the "Colbert Report" segment, Bayer is portrayed as a "lonely lady scientist" with a nefarious plan to perfect a scallop-man hybrid and destroy the human race.
"I am not trying to destroy the human race," Bayer tells the interviewer in the piece.
Mays tells the show producers that he gave the scallop gonads to Bayer and then traded the scallop meat with friends for liquor. At one point, he gulps down a large scallop gonad for the camera.
"If you crash your car drunk and need someone to help you hide it and everything, I can do that on a minute's notice," he tells the interviewer with a straight face.
Contacted about his appearance on the comedy show, Mays said he was happy to play along and poke fun at himself, even for the sake of a TV show he has never seen. He said he doesn't have cable or even a television because he doesn't have time for it.
"I was class clown in high school, in the yearbook," Mays said. "I don't have a problem with self-deprecating humor."
Mays said part of the fun has been the reaction he's gotten from friends and family telling them he's going to be on the show.
"I'm more amused by my friends' amusement and excitement about it," he said. "It's wintertime. It'll be fun."
Savini said she and another staffer with "The Colbert Report" came to Maine in early February and, with the help of a camera crew based in Portland, spent two and a half days interviewing people involved in the incident.

Full text:   SOUTHWEST HARBOR, Maine -- Scallop gonads do not have a reputation as being intrinsically funny, the way banana peels or rubber chickens might.
But when two buckets full of the mollusk innards that are part of a scientific study go missing, and when the police get involved to find out where they may have been taken, there's a chance somebody might try to make a wisecrack about it.
There's also a chance, apparently, that a national cable comedy television show might take an interest.
That's what happened last fall when an incident in which a local scallop fisherman misplaced two buckets of scallop guts made national headlines. "The Colbert Report" on Comedy Central decided to spoof the incident and, with the help of those involved, came to Maine to film a segment on it last month. The segment aired on the cable program on Monday night.
Last Nov. 26, police on Mount Desert Island and in Ellsworth alerted the public that the buckets went missing after the fisherman, Andy Mays, mistakenly put them in the back of the wrong car and the person then drove off, not knowing the bivalve bits were coming along for the ride.
A producer at "The Colbert Report," hosted by comedian Stephen Colbert, saw the headlines and decided the story was too weird to pass up.
"We spend a lot of time on the Internet," show producer Nicole Savini said Monday.
"It seemed very 'Maine.' The unlocked car, the scallop guts."
Mays had been collecting scallops for six months as part of a research project through Darling Marine Center, a University of Maine marine research facility in South Bristol. He had gutted the bivalves, isolated the gonads and stored them in formaldehyde, and made arrangements to deliver them to Skylar Bayer, a grad student at the Darling Center who had agreed to meet him at a Mount Desert Island convenience store.
Mays got to the Somesville One Stop, spotted a parked car with UMaine plates, put the scallops in the vehicle and then went inside the store to find Bayer. She was not there, however, and when he went back outside, the car with the scallop guts wasn't either.
Mays had put the gonads in a blue Chevrolet Impala belonging to the UMaine Motor Pool that Abigail Garthwait, an associate professor at UMaine, had driven to MDI earlier that day. On her way back to the university she stopped at the One Stop to get a bite to eat and, when she left again, failed to notice the buckets in the backseat. It wasn't until around 5 p.m., when she stopped in Orono to fill up with gas, that she saw the two buckets labeled "formaldehyde."
In the "Colbert Report" segment, Bayer is portrayed as a "lonely lady scientist" with a nefarious plan to perfect a scallop-man hybrid and destroy the human race.
"I am not trying to destroy the human race," Bayer tells the interviewer in the piece.
Mays tells the show producers that he gave the scallop gonads to Bayer and then traded the scallop meat with friends for liquor. At one point, he gulps down a large scallop gonad for the camera.
"If you crash your car drunk and need someone to help you hide it and everything, I can do that on a minute's notice," he tells the interviewer with a straight face.
Contacted about his appearance on the comedy show, Mays said he was happy to play along and poke fun at himself, even for the sake of a TV show he has never seen. He said he doesn't have cable or even a television because he doesn't have time for it.
"I was class clown in high school, in the yearbook," Mays said. "I don't have a problem with self-deprecating humor."
Mays said part of the fun has been the reaction he's gotten from friends and family telling them he's going to be on the show.
"I'm more amused by my friends' amusement and excitement about it," he said. "It's wintertime. It'll be fun."
Savini said she and another staffer with "The Colbert Report" came to Maine in early February and, with the help of a camera crew based in Portland, spent two and a half days interviewing people involved in the incident. Aside from Mays and Bayer, they also interviewed Garthwaite on camera for the piece.
"It was really, really cold," Savini said. "I'd never seen the inside of a scallop before."
Savini ate a lot of "the best scallops I've had" during her visit, she said. They interviewed Mays on his boat, Lost Airmen, but did not leave the dock.
"Andy made all of his resources available to us," she said. "Everyone in Maine was fantastic."

The time to act on climate change is now. I applaud the president for drawing a line in the sand with Congress, saying that if it does not step up and act, he will. The president has the authority to act and the American people are ready to work with him to face this great challenge of the time.

Bill pulls sustainability, legality of seaweed harvesting into spotlight

Full text:   LUBEC, Maine -- Proposed legislation that would explore statewide regulation of the commercial harvesting of seaweed along Maine's 3,000 miles of craggy coastline has re-energized years of debate over whether cutting rockweed and other species of seaweed should be allowed at all.
Rep. Ellen Winchenbach (R-Waldoboro), a member of the legislature's Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources, is sponsoring a bill that tasks the state's commissioner of Marine Resources with developing a statewide approach to seaweed harvest management and to present the plan to the committee before Jan. 14, 2014.
The bill, LD 585, also calls for repealing legislation that in 2009 established the Cobscook Bay Rockweed Management Area 90 as a rockweed conservation effort.
That 2009 legislation requires pre-harvest plans to be filed by would-be harvesters, including crews from Nova Scotia. It also divided the bay in northeastern Washington County into 36 assigned harvest sections, capping the harvest within each sector at 17 percent of the total estimated biomass. The law also established a surcharge of $1.50 per wet ton of seaweed landed, with those funds are used to support seaweed research, management and enforcement.
According to the Maine Department of Marine Resources, the statewide seaweed harvest in 2011 totaled 15.3 million pounds, up from 12.9 million pounds in 2010. That represents the biggest harvest ever, with rockweed accounting for about 90 percent of the seaweed taken and about 90 percent of the rockweed cut within Cobscook Bay.
Harvesters were paid 3 cents a pound in 2011, up from 2 cents a pound the year before. That made the 2011 fresh harvest worth $422,000, up from $258,000 in 2010.
While prices paid at the dock is minimal, the DMR notes that only a small fraction of the harvest is sold raw. The majority of the harvest is dried, ground and sold as components of wholesale and retail products that include food supplements, fertilizers and animal feed products. Collectively those value-added products are worth $20 million per year, making rockweed and other seaweed species indigenous to the Gulf of Maine tidal zones "one of Maine's most valuable marine resources," according to a DMR factsheet.
The sometimes contentious debate between commercial harvesters and seaweed conservationists has been raging for years, with harvesters claiming the cutting techniques they employ allow regeneration of rockweed. Conservationists liken the shoreline intertidal zones, where rockweed thrives, to an "old-growth underwater forest" that provides both habitat and sustenance to as many as 150 species of seabirds, shorebirds, ducks, fish and invertebrates, including some species important to commercial fishing.
Rep. Winchenbach said Saturday that, as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources, she's heard both sides make strong cases for their divergent points of view and feels the issue should be resolved.
"I want this bill to bring the two parties -- the business side and the conservation side -- together to have a conversation about this," she said. "The conservation side says the rockweed is stripped when it's raked, while the other side says the process they use is conscious of how to best manage harvesting to protect the resource."
Asked why her bill calls for repealing the existing 2009 conservation regulations for Cobscook Bay, Winchenbach offered only this response: "That's a good question," she said. "And we'll need to discuss it."
The introduction of LD 585 recently triggered a 500-signature petition drive by a Lubec-group called "Save Our Seaweed." As of Saturday afternoon, the group's website ( http://www.change.org/petitions/save-our-seaweed) showed that 342 people had signed the petition destined for the joint committee.
Those who have signed the petition support this position statement: "I oppose removing the Cobscook Bay Rockweed Management Area law. In light of what the bay now looks like after rockweed harvesting, I ask for a moratorium against any further harvesting of Cobscook and Passamaquoddy Bays. I believe the rockweed (seaweed) is absolutely critical to our local Cobscook / Passamaquoddy Bay fisheries, which includes hundreds of jobs versus the handful of jobs employing seaweed harvesters."
Among those who have been studying the issue is Robin Hadlock Seeley, a marine ecologist who is a senior research associate at New York's Cornell University. She has been focused on the marine ecology of Cobscook Bay for 30 years, doing research during her summer stays at the Shoals Marine Laboratory facility on Maine's Appledore Island, which is southeast of Kittery. She said Saturday that, based on what she's seen, she supports a rockweed harvest moratorium, as proposed in the petition.
"Members of the public are asking for a moratorium on rockweed harvesting in Cobscook Bay until there is good science showing that there would be no effects of rockweed harvesting on other fisheries or
on the ecosystem," she told the Bangor Daily News. "Rockweed harvesting has not been certified as ecologically sustainable by any group or agency.
"We know a lot about the impacts of rockweed harvesting on, for example, fish, ducks, periwinkles and the rockweed itself. We know enough now to conclude that rockweed harvesting presents too much risk to fisheries and to coastal ecosystems.
"With all the news about groundfisheries, like cod, in trouble, and the newly realized importance of forage fish to the survival and restoration of groundfisheries, why would we put at risk the marine habitat that supports these fisheries by allowing it to be cut down and processed into agricultural fertilizer and cattle feed supplements? This makes no sense."
Among those who have signed the "Save Our Seaweed" petition is Shelly Tinker of Whiting, a diver whose niche is underwater photography.
"I've been diving in these waters for a long time, and these kelp forests are beautiful," she said. "I can't imagine them being gone. They are the beginning of the food chain and provide 70 percent to 80 percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere. Some of these rockweeds are 15 or 16 years old. If they are not properly harvested, they will never grow back."
Complicating the debate, Seeley points out, is the fact that it has never been determine if rockweed harvesting in intertidal areas abutting private property is legal, without consent or compensation. While the legal right of the public to harvest shellfish, wrinkles and worms from intertidal zones that front private property is well established in Maine law, she said, there is no established right to harvest seaweed.
"The taking of rockweed from private lands is in legal limbo," she said Saturday.

Maine shrimp season might be called off

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]01 Dec 2012.

Abstract: The Maine shrimping community considers these to be important sessions, as the shrimp fishery is a $70 million industry that employs 1,500 people, from fishermen to those involved in trucking and processing the catch. Of the 256 shrimp boats operating in Gulf of Maine shrimp habitat last year, 225 of those boats were out of Maine, the other 31 out of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Maine boats accounted for 90 percent of the catch, which had a landed value of about 95 cents a pound. "It's going to be interesting, as I expect there will be a contentious audience," said Jim Markos, the general manager of the Ellsworth-based Maine Shellfish Co., which has a wholesale inventory that includes Maine shrimp. "I'll be there, and I expect to leave with my ears ringing, and I expect to leave disappointed in the length of the season." "The problem for shrimp is that the water is too warm for them in that section of the Gulf of Maine," she said. "They are a sub-Arctic species, and this is the southernmost part of their habitat. And for the shrimp here it's a closed system. The only way out of it is through the southern and eastern parts of the Gulf, and those parts are the warmest parts."

Full text:   PORTLAND -- Maine's shrimp boats traditionally take to the waters of the Gulf of Maine the first week of December. But not this year. And not last year.
In fact, the Northern Shrimp Technical Committee of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission recommends that there not be a shrimp season at all this year.
Concern about depleted stocks and previous years of overfishing pushed the start of the 2011-12 shrimping season back from December to January 3, 2012, for trawlers, who were limited to fishing on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and back to Feb. 1, 2012, for trappers, limited to landings of 1,000 pounds a day.
Regulatory officials also pulled the plug early on the New England shrimp fishery last season, ending it on Feb. 17, 2012, claiming that shrimpers had already exceeded the catch limit of 4.9 million metric tons by as many as 1 million metric tons. That closure left trawlers with a 21-day season and trappers with a 17-day season.
In a recent 81-page analysis released Nov. 21, the Northern Shrimp Technical Committee recommends a moratorium on shrimp fishing for 2013.
"Given the current condition of the resource (overfished and overfishing occurring) and poor prospects for the near future, the NSTC recommends that the Section implement a moratorium on fishing in 2013," the report says. "If a fishery is allowed in 2013, the NSTC recommends a highly conservative approach ... [including] starting the season after at least 50 percent of shrimp have hatched their brood. In recent years the midpoint of the hatch has been around Feb. 15.
"The NSTC bases its recommendations to the Section on its assessment of current stock status, the biology of the species, and the stated management goal of protecting and maintaining the stock at levels that will support a viable fishery on a sustainable resource. ... Short-term commercial prospects for the 2013 fishing season are very poor given the low abundance of all stages of shrimp in the 2012 survey and the relatively small size of females in the 2011 and 2012 surveys."
Those recommendations will be discussed during a daylong, two-session meeting in Portland on Monday, Dec. 3, at the downtown Holiday Inn by the Bay convention center. The 9 a.m. session involves the Northern Shrimp Advisory Panel and will include a review of the 2011-12 season status report by the Northern Shrimp Technical Committee and its moratorium recommendation. The 1 p.m. afternoon session will involve the Northern Shrimp Section, which includes one representative each from Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
That three-member group will decide at that meeting what the 2012-13 shrimp season will look like -- if there is one -- after analyzing the technical committee's report and recommendations from an industry advisory panel.
The Maine shrimping community considers these to be important sessions, as the shrimp fishery is a $70 million industry that employs 1,500 people, from fishermen to those involved in trucking and processing the catch. Of the 256 shrimp boats operating in Gulf of Maine shrimp habitat last year, 225 of those boats were out of Maine, the other 31 out of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Maine boats accounted for 90 percent of the catch, which had a landed value of about 95 cents a pound.
"It's going to be interesting, as I expect there will be a contentious audience," said Jim Markos, the general manager of the Ellsworth-based Maine Shellfish Co., which has a wholesale inventory that includes Maine shrimp. "I'll be there, and I expect to leave with my ears ringing, and I expect to leave disappointed in the length of the season."
Margaret "Maggie" Hunter is a shrimp specialist with Maine Department of Marine Resources and a member of the NSTC. She said Friday that, no matter what happens at Monday's meetings, it's going to be a "hard year" for both shrimpers and shrimp.
Hunter said shrimp thrive in cold waters and that their habitat off the Maine coastline has been heating up in recent years.
"The problem for shrimp is that the water is too warm for them in that section of the Gulf of Maine," she said. "They are a sub-Arctic species, and this is the southernmost part of their habitat. And for the shrimp here it's a closed system. The only way out of it is through the southern and eastern parts of the Gulf, and those parts are the warmest parts."
Hunter said there was a similar Gulf of Maine warming trend in the 1950s, during which Maine shrimp all but disappeared. When that trend reversed after a few years and Gulf of Maine waters became colder, shrimp populations increased dramatically.
"I'm not thinking that shrimp are going extinct here if the warming trend continues," she said. "If it continues, we won't have commercial quantities, but I'm not ready to pull the shade on them yet."

Abstract: Before now, scientists deduced a lobster's age judging by size and other variables. But it's now known that lobsters and other crustaceans, such as crabs and shrimp, grow one ring per year in hidden-away internal spots, [Raouf Kilada] said. "We've thought lobsters could live to 100 years old, and this new aging technique will be a way to document that," said Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine's Lobster Institute. The paper was published in this month's Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, a well-regarded peer-reviewed scientific journal based in Ottawa, Ontario, that has been published since 1901. Kilada's was one of more than 50 scientific presentations at the conference, attended by more than 100 lobster scientists from the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Full text:   PORTLAND -- For the first time, scientists have figured out how to determine the age of a lobster -- by counting its rings, like a tree.
Nobody knows how old lobsters can live to be; some people estimate they live to more than 100.
But knowing -- rather than simply guessing -- their age and that of other shellfish could help scientists better understand the population and assist regulators of the lucrative industry, said Raouf Kilada, a research associate at the University of New Brunswick who was the lead author of a scientific paper documenting the process.
Before now, scientists deduced a lobster's age judging by size and other variables. But it's now known that lobsters and other crustaceans, such as crabs and shrimp, grow one ring per year in hidden-away internal spots, Kilada said.
"Having the age information for any commercial species will definitely improve the stock assessment and ensure sustainability," he said after presenting his findings Thursday at a scientific conference in Portland.
Scientists already could tell a fish's age by counting the growth rings found in a bony part of its inner ear, a shark's age from the rings in its vertebrae and a scallop or clam's age from the rings of its shell.
But crustaceans posed a problem because of the apparent absence of any permanent growth structures. It was thought that when lobsters and other crustaceans molt, they shed all calcified body parts that might record annual growth bands.
For their research, Kilada and five other Canadian researchers took a closer look at lobsters, snow crabs, northern shrimp and sculptured shrimp.
They found that growth rings, in fact, could be found in the eyestalk -- a stalk connected to the body with an eyeball on the end -- of lobsters, crabs and shrimp. In lobsters and crabs, the rings were also found in the so-called "gastric mills," parts of the stomach with three teeth-like structures used to grind up food.
To find the growth bands, the scientists dissected the eyestalks and the gastric mills, cut out sections and viewed them under microscopes.
Lobsters don't lose reproductive capabilities or organ functions or exhibit signs of aging as they get older, but nobody knows for sure how old they can live to be.
"We've thought lobsters could live to 100 years old, and this new aging technique will be a way to document that," said Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine's Lobster Institute.
The paper was published in this month's Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, a well-regarded peer-reviewed scientific journal based in Ottawa, Ontario, that has been published since 1901. Kilada's was one of more than 50 scientific presentations at the conference, attended by more than 100 lobster scientists from the U.S., Canada and Europe.
Bayer agreed that this is the first time scientists have a direct method to place an age on crustaceans.
"Right now we're just guessing at their age," he said.
Kilada said he saw lobster specimens that were 16 or 17 years old during his research. He estimates that there are lobsters 60 or 70 years old living in the wild.
Susan Waddy, a lobster researcher with Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans, said she has kept lobsters in her laboratory that are more than 30 years old. She suspects they live to be 40 or 50.
"We know they don't live forever," she said.

Full text:   ORONO -- The mystery of the missing mollusk innards is over, as the preserved scallop guts mistakenly placed in the wrong vehicle make their way to a UMaine research facility in South Bristol.
An associate professor with the University of Maine was traveling to Orono on Saturday afternoon after a visit to Pemetic Elementary School in Southwest Harbor. She made a pitstop at Somesville One Stop to grab a bite to eat.
The teacher, Abigail Garthwait, didn't know that while she was inside, a local scallop diver placed the preserved bivalve bits in her backseat, mistaking her vehicle for one belonging to a graduate student he meant to meet there.
He'd been collecting the material for six months as part of research project for the Darling Marine Center, a UMaine research plant in Walpole, a village of South Bristol.
Garthwait got back in her vehicle, a blue Chevrolet Impala belonging to the UMaine Motor Pool, and kept driving. She had to refuel in Orono and it was there, around 5 p.m., that she noticed the two buckets labeled "formaldehyde."
"I saw those buckets and said, 'Where the heck did those come from?'" she said Wednesday.
Garthwait assumed the buckets had been in the backseat all along, perhaps left over from the last university employee to use the motor pool car, and that she'd simply not noticed them. Another university employee thought it might be best to throw them away, but Garthwait asked her to hold off.
"I figured it would be better to leave them in the car rather than take them out, because whoever left them there would track them back to the car," she said.
On Tuesday, the diver's wife, Michelle Mays, contacted local police departments and spoke with reporters about the missing scallop guts. They represented six months of labor and research lost if they weren't recovered, she said.
News of the missing scallop guts spread quickly Tuesday on Facebook. Garthwait saw the links early Wednesday morning and started telling friends who had posted them: "It was me. I have the scallop guts."
The teacher called Mays, and as of Wednesday morning the guts were on their way to Walpole.
Mays was relieved her husband's work had not been in vain, undone by a simple mistake, and she noted the role of social media in locating the missing research material.
"It's a happy ending," she said Wednesday morning. "She [Garthwait] said this is because two of her friends reposted my story on Facebook. So thank you, Facebook."

Full text:   MOUNT DESERT (AP) -- A Maine fisherman is seeking help from the public and police in finding his scallop guts.
These aren't just any scallop guts. Andy Mays of Southwest Harbor had been collecting scallops for six months for a project by the University of Maine's marine research facility. He'd gutted the bivalves, isolated different organs and preserved them in formaldehyde.
Mays' wife, Michelle, told the Bangor Daily News he was scheduled to hand over the parts to a graduate student at a convenience store Monday.
When he arrived, he put the container of bits into a car with University of Maine plates, assuming it belonged to the student. It did not, and when he came back outside, the car was gone.
Michelle Mays said the fear is that someone will throw out the scallops.

Abstract: "It was a harrowing experience," recalled Dick Skillin, facilities and post office manager for the Ocean Park Association. "Water flooded the post office. The fire department had to come and take us out." "Reducing human and ecosystem vulnerability to harm and increasing resilience in the face of change," according to the report, "is both an economic and moral imperative."

Vermont has 'Climate Cabinet' preparing for change
In late August 2011, a catastrophic storm hit Vermont. The tail-end of Hurricane Irene, the storm and its flooding caused three deaths, left a half-dozen communities isolated for a week and wiped out hundreds of miles of roadways.
Scientists linked the storm's ferocity to climate change. But it didn't take the deadly event to prompt action on the state level: Gov. Peter Shumlin had already formed a "Climate Cabinet," in May 2011.
Shumlin has charged his Climate Cabinet with a range of tasks, including having the state partner with local governments so Vermont communities "grow sustainably and are resilient to climate-change impacts in the future."
A second task is to come up with ways to "protect Vermonters, their property, the state's economic well-being and the state's natural resources" from the effects of a warming climate.
-- Kate McCormick
Hurricane Sandy?
Yes, but it is also the story of the Patriots Day storm of 2007 along the southern Maine coast.
Experts say both storms are harbingers of yet more severe storms to come, made worse by the effects of a warming climate.
The streets are dry and clear these days in Ocean Park, the 130-year-old enclave at the southern tip of Old Orchard Beach.
But on April 16 five years ago, they were submerged in up to 4 feet of seawater from a rising tide that rode across the village's beach and wetlands and from a pounding rain, all of it trapped in the low-lying neighborhood.
"It was a harrowing experience," recalled Dick Skillin, facilities and post office manager for the Ocean Park Association. "Water flooded the post office. The fire department had to come and take us out."
Most of the scientific community accepts that climate change is having worldwide effects; its direct impact on Maine has also been the subject of scientific research.
"Maine's Climate Future," a 2009 report from the Climate Change Institute of the University of Maine, reported:
"For the 21st century, the models show a strong trend in Maine toward warmer conditions with more precipitation in all four seasons."
The report concludes the rising temperatures in Maine threaten everything from tourism to farming and forestry and that the state must plan for those changes.
"Reducing human and ecosystem vulnerability to harm and increasing resilience in the face of change," according to the report, "is both an economic and moral imperative."
As Old Orchard Beach planner Gary Lamb told the Scarborough Leader in 2010, "If you transpose a 2-foot rise in sea level upon the area, every high tide would mirror the Patriot's Day storm."
How are state and local governments responding?
Research by the Maine Center for Public Interest Reporting shows a patchwork of some communities taking action, while others are hanging back.
Issue takes a 'back seat'
On the state level, the work of former Gov. John Baldacci's administration to develop specific ways for the state to help cities and towns cope with climate change has been halted and results of the initial work removed from the state's website by the administration of Gov. Paul LePage.
"We made a conscious decision that (climate change) would take a back seat," Darryl Brown, LePage's first Department of Environmental Protection commissioner, said in an interview last spring. The DEP, its staff reduced by attrition, halted work on the climate change report in early 2011.
That unraveled the plan outlined by Baldacci, who told the scientists that their initial study would lead to a "framework" for state and local policies to cope with the effects of climate change.
That work began in 2007 when Baldacci commissioned the scientific study, which was completed in 2009.
The Legislature then passed a resolution ordering the DEP to lay out ways in which Maine could adapt to its new climate.
The initial report was delivered to the Legislature in early 2010. It was the work of 75 stakeholders, including Hannaford markets, the Maine Audubon Society, the Small Woodland Owners Association of Maine and 13 state agencies. The document set out 60 recommendations.
Acknowledging that the state's communities would have to do the major work in preparing for climate change, the report was designed to give towns and cities support by making available, for example, accurate climate data specific to Maine.
It also recommended that state agencies and municipalities work together to figure out how climate change will affect local buildings, roads and other structures -- and how much it will cost.
And, the report said, that sort of planning would make it easier for the state to work with federal agencies to get the money to pay for such projects.
Those concerns led Baldacci to sign a resolution calling for a second study to make more specific recommendations, along with cost estimates. That report, which was to constitute Maine's official climate-change adaptation plan, was due to be presented in January of this year.
In January 2011, Baldacci, a Democrat, ended his term in office, and Republican LePage was sworn in.
"We changed the focus dramatically," said Brown, who was appointed LePage's DEP commissioner that January and who resigned the following April after Attorney General William Schneider ruled that Brown's former business interests made him ineligible to hold the job.
The administration, Brown said, felt that the interests of Maine would be better served by making environmental regulations more friendly to business.
Instead of presenting a plan in January 2012, new DEP Commissioner Patricia Aho gave the Legislature a two-page letter that referred to the 2010 report, adding, "The limited resources of all stakeholders should be targeted toward continued implementation (of the original report's recommendations) rather than further document development."
Aho acknowledged that the 2010 report was no longer on the DEP website.
"We had to make a choice because we had thousands upon thousands of documents and we needed to reduce our website," she said.
The DEP, she said, is still involved in initiatives related to climate change, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which seeks to reduce Maine's emission of carbon dioxide; increasing industrial efficiency; and helping communities with culvert work.
But experts closely involved in the project see the state's abandonment of the project as a loss.
Malcolm Burson, who served as the DEP's Climate Adaptation program manager before his retirement in 2011, said one of the strengths of the now-missing 2010 report was that "it represented the beginning of a planning process."
For now, the focus is on the work of some towns and cities to deal with climate change, he said. But, for example, all of Maine's 3,500 miles of coastline are facing the effects of sea-level rise.
"It's probably a lot more efficient" to have a higher level of government looking at the problems and helping to coordinate the response to them, said Burson, now with the Conservation Law Foundation as a public policy adviser.
Andy Whitman is a director at the Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences and took part in the climate report.
"The biggest loss is not so much that the 2010 report was permanently shelved," he said, "but that its reasonable way forward was discontinued. The project created a network that represented the diverse needs of local communities and the business community. With a sense of shared responsibility, key stakeholders created practical and sensible strategies to sparingly improve existing programs.
"This network ," he said, "would have been a good springboard for dealing with the challenges of climate change in a no-nonsense way with broad political support. Instead, as it stands now, Maine's communities and businesses will have to bear the burden of this lost opportunity."
Sam Merrill, director of the New England Environmental Finance Center at the University of Southern Maine, said the work that towns and cities must do "needs support and coordination from the state."
Without a state plan, he said, towns and cities are struggling to do what they can. He added, "People are getting it because they're getting wet."
The local response
In Saco Bay, which includes Ocean Park, Old Orchard Beach and Biddeford, officials in 2010 used a state grant to study the problem of rising sea levels.
Their "vulnerability" report issued in April 2011 came up with a stunning statistic: High tides combined with a rising sea level from a severe storm would cause $1 billion in damages and affect 2,400 structures.
The group came up with a "next steps" plan that includes building code improvements and better flood-plain management.
Peter Slovinsky, a coastal geologist who has worked with many of the towns, noted that Saco recently became the first town in Maine to change its flood-plain map to take into account future sea-level rise.
Residents who want to build or rebuild in certain areas of town will have to put their new structures a full 2 feet higher than the original map allowed.
Meanwhile, the Southern Maine Regional Planning Commission hired an engineering firm to study what could be done about the threat of rising sea levels to Ogunquit's wastewater treatment plant.
The plant sits on low land near the shoreline. For years, the plant and its pump stations have been flooded during major storms.
The firm, Woodard and Curran, said the plant was at "high risk" of inundation over the next 20 to 30 years or sooner if flooding increases more rapidly. It recommended several actions that are now being studied.
Merrill, the environmental finance center chief, was invited by Damariscotta's Comprehensive Plan Steering Committee in July to talk about climate change and its effects on coastal towns.
Of the storms occurring in Maine over the past 100 years, six of the 10 worst have come during the past 10 years, Merrill said.
"We are seeing more and more impacts of change," he told the town's residents, including one who stood up to tell his own story.
Mike Herz lives along the Damariscotta River; his property includes a small cottage on the tidal river's edge.
He said a recent high tide, accompanied by a storm surge, had left more than an inch of water in his cottage.
"I've known all along, in an abstract way, that this was coming," he said. Now that it's actually happened, he said he would be busy figuring out how to raise the cottage by at least 2 feet.

Full text:   LAMOINE, Maine -- A local man who police say was shot and killed by his adult son early Tuesday was concerned that he might die a violent death, according to a neighbor.
Bill Trotter, Bangor Daily News
The Maine State Police Major Crimes Unit was on scene Wednesday morning at 16 Bobolink Lane in Lamoine, the site of three fatal shootings -- one by police -- the day before.
Police say that Robert Tilden, 50, and his brother-in-law Russell Pinkham, also 50, both were shot and killed around 3:30 a.m. Tuesday by Tilden's son, Leon R. Tilden, at the family compound on Mud Creek Road.
Leon Tilden, 27, died hours later, after Maine State Police and other law enforcement agencies began a manhunt for him in the area. According to police, the younger Tilden was armed when he was encountered on the property by a member of the Maine State Police Tactical Team around 10 a.m. and shot, police said Tuesday. Leon Tilden was taken to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, where he died of his injuries later that morning.
State police continued Wednesday morning to investigate and collect evidence at the scene of the shootings. Police are expected to be at the property for much of the day.
Stan Olencki, who lives on the other side of Mud Creek Road from the Tildens, said Wednesday that he considered Robert Tilden a good friend. Olencki and his wife bought their property from the Pinkham family when they moved to Maine from New Jersey in 2000. Lori Tilden, Leon's mother and Robert's wife, is Russell Pinkham's sister.
Olencki said Robert Tilden was "the ideal entrepreneur," dabbling in different kinds of seasonal work to support his family.
"He made Christmas wreaths. He did a lot of chainsaw art," Olencki said. "He'll be dearly missed."
Olencki said there were problems between Robert Tilden and Leon Tilden, but he did not go into detail and said he wasn't exactly sure what may have caused the friction. He said both father and son were known to have firearms.
He said that, not long ago, he heard gunshots coming from the woods across the road on the Tilden's property. Olencki said he wasn't overly concerned about the gunshots, but went over to ask Robert Tilden about it. Leon, apparently, was shooting targets of some sort, he said.
That's when Tilden told him he was worried about his son.
"He was afraid his son was going to kill him," Olencki said. "He wasn't joking."
Olencki said he has been thinking a lot about Tilden's remark since Tuesday morning.
"Maybe there is something I could have done," the neighbor said. "It's so senseless. I've been having trouble sleeping, to be honest with you."
Other neighbors and local residents who were asked Wednesday morning about the Tildens said they did not want to comment.
In addition to making wreaths and carving wood, Robert Tilden dug for clams and bloodworms.
At one point, Tilden appeared on on an episode of Discovery Channel's "Dirty Jobs," to show host Mike Rowe how to dig for bloodworms.
In an article published in 1998 in the Bangor Daily News, the elder Tilden was quoted about his efforts to cultivate oysters in a tidal creek just down the road from his home.
"My first love was the ocean," the article quoted Robert Tilden as saying. "I actually feel more proud of my oysters than anything else in my life. They're like your babies."
Stu Marckoon, an administrative assistant to the board of selectmen, said Russell Pinkham worked as a truck driver.
"Both of them were the nicest guys you'd want to meet," Marckoon said of Robert Tilden and Russell Pinkham. "They were delightful when they'd come into the office to transact whatever they needed to transact. They were just good down-to-earth folks."
According to Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland, the on-scene investigation is expected to continue through Wednesday.
"I'm not anticipating we're going to have solid answers today," McCausland said Wednesday morning in a phone interview. "We have a team of detectives back at the scene gathering evidence, concentrated on the initial double-homicide."
McCausland did provide some additional details of the initial double homicide: The elder Tilden and Pinkham were both found dead outside the family home. Tilden's body was found in the driveway; Pinkham's was in a grassy area near the house.
Leon Tilden fired multiple shots when he killed his relatives, McCausland said.
"There were a number of shots fired. ... The question is the cause of death. We'll await the medical examiner's decision as to how many times the two victims were struck."
All three bodies are at the state medical examiner's office in Augusta, where an autopsy is expected Thursday.
McCausland also said Tilden had been living in a "camp-like building" behind his family's home when the shooting occurred. Police recovered a number of guns on the property, including handguns and long guns.
As for what led up to the double homicide, McCausland said police are still searching for answers.
"We don't have a solid answer as to what set him off," he said. "We're talking to relatives -- the immediate family -- and friends."
The fatal shooting is the second in Lamoine in the past seven months. In March, Ellsworth resident Lawrence "Randy" Sinclair was killed and three others wounded -- including the alleged shooter -- when gunfire erupted outside a local home on Route 184.
Local resident Michael Carter, 30, is facing charges of murder, elevated aggravated assault, aggravated assault and illegal possession of a firearm in connection with the March shooting. Carter is expected to face trial on those charges sometime next year.

Maine fisheries rank third in value

Abstract: The value of Alaska's landings last year was nearly $1.9 billion, much of it generated by the pollock fishery, while in Massachusetts scallops were the single biggest contributor to that state's $570 million landings value. Immediately behind Maine in the value rankings were, in order, Louisiana, Washington, Texas and California. Value is determined by what fishermen are paid for their catch. The value of Maine's lobster fishery is the reason Stonington was the top-ranked port in the state for landings value. The Hancock County town was ranked 21st nationally in 2011 with a commercial fisheries landings value of $48 million. Portland was ranked 21st in a separate list that ranked ports nationwide by volume of landings. Portland, which hosts the state's largest groundfishing fleet, was ranked 37th for value in the country while Stonington was ranked 39th for volume. Rockland, which like Stonington is a major port for the state's lobster fleet, also made both top-50 lists, ranking 27th for volume and 46th for value.

Full text:   STONINGTON -- Much has been said about how Maine ranks against the rest of the country when it comes to child well-being, income growth, bike-friendliness and, of course, doing business.
Troy R. Bennett/Bangor Daily News
A lobster bound for the table at the 65th annual Maine Lobster Festival in Rockland in August 2012.
When it comes to the value of its commercial fish landings, however, Maine shoots past most of the others.
Many states aren't included on the list, which was released last week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, because they are not located on the coast or Great Lakes and so have no commercial fisheries to speak of. But of the 30 states that do -- most, if not all, of which have more people than Maine -- only two rank higher: Alaska and Massachusetts.
Maine, which had commercial fish landings worth $426,500,000 in 2011, ranks third in the country, in large part because of its $334 million lobster fishery.
The value of Alaska's landings last year was nearly $1.9 billion, much of it generated by the pollock fishery, while in Massachusetts scallops were the single biggest contributor to that state's $570 million landings value. Immediately behind Maine in the value rankings were, in order, Louisiana, Washington, Texas and California. Value is determined by what fishermen are paid for their catch.
Maine ranked eighth nationwide in terms of volume with 270 million pounds of fish landed in 2011.
The value of Maine's lobster fishery is the reason Stonington was the top-ranked port in the state for landings value. The Hancock County town was ranked 21st nationally in 2011 with a commercial fisheries landings value of $48 million. Portland was ranked 21st in a separate list that ranked ports nationwide by volume of landings.
Portland, which hosts the state's largest groundfishing fleet, was ranked 37th for value in the country while Stonington was ranked 39th for volume. Rockland, which like Stonington is a major port for the state's lobster fleet, also made both top-50 lists, ranking 27th for volume and 46th for value.
According to the NOAA report, 126.3 million pounds of American lobster were caught nationwide in 2011, all of it on the East Coast. In Maine alone, 104 million pounds of lobster were brought ashore by Maine fishermen last year.
The value of Atlantic cod landings increased from $28.1 million in 2010 to $32.6 million last year, but the volume decreased from 17.7 million to 17.6 million pounds., the report indicated. Declining stock estimates for groundfish species such as cod off the Northeast coast led federal officials to declare a fisheries disaster for the region on Sept. 13. But another NOAA report released last week suggests that some species may be relocating to colder waters due to warming ocean temperatures.
The nationwide landings for commercial fishermen added up to 10.1 billion pounds of fish and shellfish in 2011, the highest total of the past 17 years, according to the NOAA landings report.
The top port in the country last year for volume was Dutch Harbor-Unalaska, where fishermen brought ashore 706 million pounds of fish. For value, New Bedford, Mass., was the top-ranked port, with a total catch worth $369 million.
Americans each ate on average 15 pounds of fish and shellfish in 2011, according to the report, down from the 2010 per-person average of 15.8 pounds. Americans ate more than 4.7 billion pounds of seafood last year, putting the country behind only China for annual seafood consumption.

But of the 30 states that do -- most, if not all, of which have more people than Maine -- only two rank higher: Alaska and Massachusetts.
Maine, which had commercial fish landings worth $426,500,000 in 2011, ranks third in the country, in large part because of its $334 million lobster fishery.
The value of Alaska's landings last year was nearly $1.9 billion, much of it generated by the pollock fishery, while in Massachusetts scallops were the single biggest contributor to that state's $570 million landings value. Immediately behind Maine in the value rankings were, in order, Louisiana, Washington, Texas and California. Value is determined by what fishermen are paid for their catch.
Maine ranked eighth nationwide in terms of volume with 270 million pounds of fish landed in 2011.
The value of Maine's lobster fishery is the reason Stonington was the top-ranked port in the state for landings value. The Hancock County town was ranked 21st nationally in 2011 with a commercial fisheries landings value of $48 million. Portland was ranked 21st in a separate list that ranked ports nationwide by volume of landings.
Portland, which hosts the state's largest groundfishing fleet, was ranked 37th for value in the country while Stonington was ranked 39th for volume. Rockland, which like Stonington is a major port for the state's lobster fleet, also made both top-50 lists, ranking 27th for volume and 46th for value.
According to the NOAA report, 126.3 million pounds of American lobster were caught nationwide in 2011, all of it on the East Coast. In Maine alone, 104 million pounds of lobster were brought ashore by Maine fishermen last year.
The value of Atlantic cod landings increased from $28.1 million in 2010 to $32.6 million last year, but the volume decreased from 17.7 million to 17.6 million pounds., the report indicated. Declining stock estimates for groundfish species such as cod off the Northeast coast led federal officials to declare a fisheries disaster for the region on Sept. 13. But another NOAA report released last week suggests that some species may be relocating to colder waters due to warming ocean temperatures.
The nationwide landings for commercial fishermen added up to 10.1 billion pounds of fish and shellfish in 2011, the highest total of the past 17 years, according to the NOAA landings report.
The top port in the country last year for volume was Dutch Harbor-Unalaska, where fishermen brought ashore 706 million pounds of fish. For value, New Bedford, Mass., was the top-ranked port, with a total catch worth $369 million.
Americans each ate on average 15 pounds of fish and shellfish in 2011, according to the report, down from the 2010 per-person average of 15.8 pounds. Americans ate more than 4.7 billion pounds of seafood last year, putting the country behind only China for annual seafood consumption.

Full text:   PORTLAND (AP) -- The U.S. seafood catch reached a 17-year high in 2011, with all regions of the country showing increases in both the volume and value of their harvests.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday that commercial fishermen last year caught 10.1 billion pounds of fish and shellfish valued at $5.3 billion. That's a 23 percent increase in volume and a 17 percent increase in value over 2010.
New Bedford, Mass., had the highest-valued catch for the 12th straight year, due largely to its scallop fishery. Dutch Harbor, Alaska, was the No. 1 port for seafood volume.
Alaska led all states in catch volume, followed by Louisiana, California, Virginia and Washington. Alaska was also tops in the value of its catch, followed by Massachusetts, Maine, Louisiana and Washington.

More and more oceanfront property owners opposing Down East seaweed harvest

Abstract: According to the Maine Department of Marine Resources, The 2010 Cobscook Bay rockweed harvest totaled 106,313 pounds out of an estimated baywide biomass of 111 million pounds. While the price paid at the dock is minimal, the DMR notes that only a small fraction of the harvest is sold fresh or raw. The majority of the harvest is processed into wholesale and retail products with a total estimated value of $20 million per year. That makes rockweed, the DMR says, "one of Maine's most valuable marine resources." "To determine whether rockweed cutting is 'sustainable' will require data on the long-term and ecosystem-wide impacts of cutting rockweed," [Robin Hadlock Seeley] said in a recent paper published by the New York Academy of Sciences. "Once a sustainable level of cutting is determined, strict regulation by resource managers will be required to protect rockweed habitat. Until sustainable levels of cutting and appropriate regulations are identified, commercial-scale rockweed cutting presents a risk to coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on those ecosystems." The rockweed section of the Maine Department of Marine Resources' website includes this statement: "In Maine, private property ownership typically extends to the low tide line. By law, people may access a privately-owned intertidal zone only for 'fishing, fowling and navigation.' Whether or not rockweed is considered a public resource and harvesting is considered 'fishing' from a modern perspective has yet to be determined by the courts."

Full text:   MACHIAS, Maine -- Opposition to harvesting seaweed continues to grow among owners of Washington County shoreline property from Eastport to Steuben.
Sharon Kiley Mack/Bangor Daily News
Jerry Lingley, 17, of Pembroke harvests rockweed in Cobscook Bay for Acadian Seaplants in 2009. A good harvester can cut five tons of seaweed a day and get paid $43 per ton.
At last count the "Rockweed Registry" maintained by the Downeast Coastal Conservancy included 532 oceanfront properties in 12 communities, most fronting Cobscook Bay. Included are parcels whose owners who do not want commercial seaweed harvesters to cut rockweed in tidal areas that front their shorelines. Rockweed harvesting bans also extend to conservation area shorelines and those owned by local, state and federal governmental entities.
Rockweed makes up at least 90 percent of total seaweed landings in Maine. The other 10 percent includes red, green and brown algae, such as dulse; nori; Irish sea moss; sea lettuce and kelp. In 2011, harvesters cut an estimated 8.8 million pounds of rockweed in Maine that was shipped to processors to be dried, ground and sold as a food supplement and as a component of fertilizer and animal feed. Ten years earlier, the rockweed harvest was 4.7 million pounds.
According to the Maine Department of Marine Resources, The 2010 Cobscook Bay rockweed harvest totaled 106,313 pounds out of an estimated baywide biomass of 111 million pounds. While the price paid at the dock is minimal, the DMR notes that only a small fraction of the harvest is sold fresh or raw. The majority of the harvest is processed into wholesale and retail products with a total estimated value of $20 million per year. That makes rockweed, the DMR says, "one of Maine's most valuable marine resources."
Until the Rockweed Registry emerged, Washington County's Cobscook Bay had been the epicenter of commercial harvesting in Maine of rockweed and other species of seaweed that grow along the North Atlantic shoreline in the intertidal zone, the area that is above water at low tide and under water at high tide. Given the jagged continuum of inlets and bays between Calais and Kittery, Maine's shoreline includes more than 3,000 miles of intertidal zone that is thick with rockweed.
Since 2000 an organized effort has been underway to protect seaweed from commercial harvesters. That cause is now being coordinated by an organization called the Rockweed Coalition. It claims Cobscook Bay has the highest biodiversity of any Eastern Seaboard area in the United States north of the tropics. Included among its long list of concerns about the environmental impact of harvesting rockweed is the extent to which it disturbs lobster nursery habitat in the intertidal zone.
"Rockweed harvesting goes back thousands of years," says Peter Thayer, a marine resources scientist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. "The Indians used it for fertilizer. Today, the bulk of the harvest revs up toward the end of summer and fall, and then picks back up in the spring, with most of the harvest trucked to Canada for processing. Among a number of Maine harvesters there is resistance due to a Maine resource being trucked to Canada for processing."
In 2009, the Maine Legislature approved the Cobscook Bay Rockweed Management Area statute, which requires pre-harvest plans from would-be harvesters and divides the bay into 36 assigned harvest sectors. It also caps the harvest within each sector at 17 percent of the total estimated biomass and establishes a surcharge of $1.50 per wet ton landed. Those funds are used to support seaweed research, management and enforcement.
Conservationists liken the shoreline areas where rockweed thrives to an old-growth "underwater forest" that provides both habitat and sustenance to as many as 150 species of seabirds, shorebirds, ducks, fish and invertebrates, including some species important to commercial fishing. How either hand-harvesting or mechanized cutting of rockweed affects that biosystem remains largely a scientific unknown, given that regrowth after cutting takes years.
Among those studying the issue is Robin Hadlock Seeley, a Rockweed Coalition activist and a marine ecologist who is a senior research associate at New York's Cornell University. She has been studying the marine ecology of Cobscook Bay for 30 years, doing research during her summer stays at the Shoals Marine Laboratory facility on Maine's Appledore Island, which is southeast of Kittery.
Seeley says only more research will determine the validity of the claim by harvesters and processors that rockweed is a sustainable source of nutritious biomass.
"To determine whether rockweed cutting is 'sustainable' will require data on the long-term and ecosystem-wide impacts of cutting rockweed," Seeley said in a recent paper published by the New York Academy of Sciences. "Once a sustainable level of cutting is determined, strict regulation by resource managers will be required to protect rockweed habitat. Until sustainable levels of cutting and appropriate regulations are identified, commercial-scale rockweed cutting presents a risk to coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on those ecosystems."
Seeley told the Bangor Daily News in a recent telephone interview that the two overarching questions related to harvesting rockweed -- pertaining to its sustainability and legality -- have yet to be answered.
The rockweed section of the Maine Department of Marine Resources' website includes this statement: "In Maine, private property ownership typically extends to the low tide line. By law, people may access a privately-owned intertidal zone only for 'fishing, fowling and navigation.' Whether or not rockweed is considered a public resource and harvesting is considered 'fishing' from a modern perspective has yet to be determined by the courts."
Seeley notes that, while the legal right of the public to harvest shellfish, wrinkles and worms from intertidal zones that front private property is well established in Maine law, there is no established right to harvest seaweed.
"Rockweed harvesting just goes on and on and on and on," Seeley said. "The state is handing out licenses on one hand and on its website reminding people that it may not be legal. I do not understand how you allow habitat that supports 150 species to be disturbed without knowing if it's sustainable or legal."
Seeley said her current research is focusing on how machine harvesting compares with hand-rake harvesting in terms of effect on rockweed plants and the habitat in which they thrive.
Alan Brooks, stewardship director for the Machias-based Downeast Coastal Conservancy, said the largest firm harvesting rockweed in Maine -- Nova Scotia-based Acadian Seaplants Ltd. -- has been responsive to requests to avoid harvesting along shorelines listed on the Rockweed Registry. Whether other, smaller harvesters are following Acadian Seaplants' lead, he said, remains an unknown.
"A number of other operators have come into Cobscook Bay, using mechanical harvesters," Brooks said. "That opens areas up to potentially more exploitation if the operators are not self-regulating.
"It's unclear whether these new operators are respecting the registry or other conservation plans. It's a different group of actors. Rather than one operation, it's five different operations. It's difficult to monitor. With mechanical harvesting they can be in and out before you even know they are there."
Acadian Seaplants spokesperson Linda Theriault said the company "intends to conduct its sustainable rockweed fishery harvest in Cobscook Bay this year" and will respect the requests of shoreline property owners listed on the Rockweed Registry. She said the company also intends to continue harvesting rockweed in the Jonesport area, as it has for the last 10 years.
Larch Hanson of Steuben has been immersed in rockweed harvesting for 40 years, both as a small-scale harvester and a producer of rockweed byproducts that he sells as animal feed supplements and garden fertilizer. He said Thursday that Acadian Seaplants' harvesting operations have now extended into Gouldsboro Bay, which fronts his property. He's not amused.
"They've been harvesting in front of my cove, and I'm not happy about it," he said. "They are not creating any goodwill with people who live on Gouldsboro Bay. Upland owners are concerned about loss of biomass creating beach erosion as it leads to more wind and more waves. These harvesters have no people skills and are perceived as roving pirates of the sea."
Hanson said he plans to initiate a rockweed registry for Gouldsboro Bay and to organize a coalition of Maine seaweed harvesters. He advocates a three-year apprenticeship for seaweed harvesters.
"The first year they would go out and harvest," he said. "The second year they would go back and study the impact of their harvest. The third year they would have an opportunity to apply what they've learned in the first two years."

Full text: STRONG -- The Porter Lake Association will celebrate a 43-year-old tradition during its 75th year with the annual Bean-Hole-Bean Supper from 5 to 6:30 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 4, at the Strong Public Beach, "Beanie's Beach."
Cost is $6 for adults; $3 children 5-11; under 5 free. Profits and dues support the association's many programs.
The annual supper held on the first Saturday in August since 1969 is a community gathering which promotes a reunion like atmosphere. The brick-lined fire pit has been restored and new benches and tables built. Association members prepare and heat 60 pounds of beans, salt pork, molasses, brown sugar and mustard in six huge canning kettles.
The kettles are picked up by boat at the six camps and brought to the Strong Beach where they are placed in a three-foot deep fire pit full of coals prepared during the night and baked underground all day. Hot dogs, rolls and drinks are complemented by a huge variety of salads and desserts brought by lake association members and community members.
The PLA under the leadership of President Mark Ranger continues to strive to uphold its traditions of the past and look to the future.
The nonprofit organization is dedicated to the preservation of Porter Lake, its shores and the wildlife inhabitants as a four season recreation area to be enjoyed by all for future generations
July of 1937 saw Strong and New Vineyard fishermen join together to organize the Porter Lake Fish and Game Association. During the next few years the association was inactive due to WWII but people from the area began to buy lots and build camps near the lake. During this time the fishing declined, the dam had deteriorated and no stocking of fish had taken place for several years.
In 1946 members began a campaign for better fishing. Working with the Department of Inland Fisheries and Game the group was able to plan for and restore the dam, clear the spawning brooks and improve fishing. By 1950 this conservation-minded group grew to 40 members who held well-attended meetings with movies and lunches of oyster stew.
The years that followed saw the development of camps with people desiring more time in outdoor recreational activities during all seasons. This development has put more pressure on the lake and requires vigilance by the Lake Association with a continued commitment to good fishing, preservation of water quality and good conservation practices of the land and water use.
Some of the Porter Lake Association contributions include financial support over 50 years for a Red Cross swimming program, construction of a storage shed for swim instruction equipment etc., record keeping of "Ice In" and "Ice Out" dates each year, dam repair work in the early 1990s, organizing and running for seven years a boat inspection/ education program for invasive plants such as milfoil and conducting a water quality monitoring.
The association supported with labor and finances the transportation of materials and equipment used to replace the boat launch at the Strong Public Beach, repaired the building used as an outhouse/ changing area and conducted erosion prevention excavation work at the New Vineyard Public Beach.
The association supported financially both the New Vineyard and Strong public libraries to purchase library books supporting the 2010 Maine State Library System's theme of water. Funds have been given to both libraries to be used as reward incentives for summer programs.
During the past year the association funded projects that supported the fifth grade science curriculum in the Strong Elementary School which included "Lake Day," visits to Porter Lake in the winter and spring where the students conducted science experiments and learned to fish.
The Lake Association, having been gifted the island from Nanette Reed, Craig Starbird and Dr. Marjorie White, maintains an outhouse, two campsites with fire pits and two log step entrances to prevent erosion.
The PLA assisted by the Franklin Co. Soil and Water Agency also promotes a "Lake Smart" program.
Memberships and volunteers are always welcome.

Abstract: According to a Marine Patrol report on the incident, officers acting on a tip found 5,592 scallops still in their shells in nine lobster crates in a shed next to [Brennan Spofford]'s house. Marine Patrol interrupted three men around 10 that evening as they were shucking scallops in the shed for Spofford, according to Marine Patrol Officer Sean Dow, who wrote the report. Officers found Spofford in the house. Marine Patrol officers have declined to comment publicly on the scallop violation charges against Spofford. But they have referred to the incident, without mentioning Spofford by name, as one of the more egregious examples of alleged taking of undersized scallops that they had dealt with during the scallop season last winter. [Jeff Toothaker] said Thursday that he did not know if Spofford has any prior scallop fishing violations. Spofford does have a prior lobster fishing violation from 2010 of fishing two traps without tags off Bass Harbor, according to court documents.

Full text: ELLSWORTH -- A Tremont man accused of storing thousands of undersized scallops in a shed next to his house is back behind bars for violating his bail, according to officials.
Besides multiple shellfish violations, Brennan Spofford, 33, also is facing drug charges in connection with an alleged heroin deal in Tremont. He was arrested Wednesday after he allegedly was found to be under the influence of some sort of intoxicant, according to his defense attorney, Jeff Toothaker of Ellsworth.
Spofford was still being held Thursday afternoon at Hancock County Jail, according to a corrections officer at the Ellsworth facility.
Spofford is accused of selling 0.3 grams of heroin for $200 to another person from a truck at an unspecified location in Tremont, according to a Maine Drug Enforcement Agency report on the alleged Feb. 28 drug transaction.
Spofford has a prior drug conviction in federal court. According to information posted in the online database of U.S. District Court in Bangor, Spofford was sentenced in January 2002 to serve four months in jail and then four months of electronic monitoring after being convicted of possession with intent to distribute heroin and aiding and abetting the commission of a crime.
The shellfish violations stem from an investigation by Marine Patrol officers on March 20.
According to a Marine Patrol report on the incident, officers acting on a tip found 5,592 scallops still in their shells in nine lobster crates in a shed next to Spofford's house. Marine Patrol interrupted three men around 10 that evening as they were shucking scallops in the shed for Spofford, according to Marine Patrol Officer Sean Dow, who wrote the report. Officers found Spofford in the house.
State law requires scallops to be shucked at sea to prevent the likelihood of harmful biotoxins being brought ashore. The edible scallop meat does not carry the biotoxin that causes paralytic shellfish poisoning, but other parts of the bivalve have been known to do so.
After seizing the scallops, marine patrol officers accompanied Spofford to his boat, which was moored off the Pretty Marsh boat landing on the western side of Mount Desert Island, and found more undersized scallops on the vessel, which then were dumped overboard.
The next day, the Marine Patrol officers measured the scallops seized in the shed and determined that 4,796 of them, or more than 85 percent, each had a diameter less than the four-inch minimum.
All four men -- Spofford, Eric Eaton, Nicholas Morse and Wade Kearns -- were summoned on charges of possession of undersized scallops, violation of a closed area, and violation of the shellfish sanitation depuration certificate, according to the report.
Information on the ages and towns of residence of the three other men was unavailable Thursday evening. Nor was it clear from the report exactly where it was that Spofford harvested the scallops before bringing them ashore.
Marine Patrol officers have declined to comment publicly on the scallop violation charges against Spofford. But they have referred to the incident, without mentioning Spofford by name, as one of the more egregious examples of alleged taking of undersized scallops that they had dealt with during the scallop season last winter.
State law sets a mandatory fine of $500 for a first-time undersized scallop violation and a $750 fine for each one after that. Separate incidents, rather than individual scallops, each are counted as a separate violation.
In 2009, the Legislature increased fines from fishing for scallops in closed areas from $250 to $1,000.
State law also mandates that the commissioner suspend the scallop license of anyone who has three or more scallop fishing violations for at least one year and possibly up to three years.
Sgt. Jay Carroll of Marine Patrol said Thursday that the commissioner has the authority to suspend multiple types of commercial fishing licenses held by any one person who has a record of significant fishing violations.
Toothaker said Thursday that he did not know if Spofford has any prior scallop fishing violations. Spofford does have a prior lobster fishing violation from 2010 of fishing two traps without tags off Bass Harbor, according to court documents.
Spofford is scheduled to appear on Sept. 14, in Ellsworth District Court for a bench trial on the shellfish violations, court documents indicate.

Clam decline in Harpswell puzzles experts

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]22 July 2012.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1027392854?accountid=10457

Abstract: "We got test results back on the clam end, which we know they do have a higher prevalence of neoplasia, a known blood disease of clams," [Denis Nault] said. "I don't expect anything unusual for the mud, it's the clam itself. We've seen (neoplasia) in different locations and different areas and we're trying to work out how to deal with that aspect." "We're trying to figure out if we're seeing it higher in juvenile clams and if it's a localized issue, in a specific cove," Nault said. "One of the complexities of Harpswell is that they have been moving clams around for quite a while, so we have to eliminate where they were moving them, where they got the seeds from and where they moved them to." "They certainly have clams in Harpswell, and they're growing. But in other areas they're not," Nault said. "You can stare at West Bath from Harpswell, and those areas are doing perfectly fine, not having that kind of an issue, so why is that? We're kind of scratching our heads trying to figure it out."

Full text: HARPSWELL -- Over the past several years, shellfisherman have noticed a decline in clams. Last month, the Marine Resources Committee decided to find out why.
"We've noticed the decline in our clams for probably the past three to four years," committee member David Wilson said. "They're just not where they usually were. What we've seen on the beds is that clams set into a spot and only get to around one and a half inches long and die."
He said that this year the clam population is not up to what it has been in the past, an unfortunate problem as diggers just regained access to nearly all of the flats, some of which have been closed for eight to 10 years due to contamination and conservation.
Wilson said clammers and the committee wondered if their beds were infected with neoplasia, a blood disease that ultimately destroys the physiological function of soft-shelled clams and kills 90 percent of infected mollusks.
Denis Nault, a biologist with the state's Shellfish Management Division, and his team conducted tests on clams and the mud they inhabit and have confirmed that some of the clams tested are infected with the disease. Full results on the mud samples are not expected back until next month.
"We got test results back on the clam end, which we know they do have a higher prevalence of neoplasia, a known blood disease of clams," Nault said. "I don't expect anything unusual for the mud, it's the clam itself. We've seen (neoplasia) in different locations and different areas and we're trying to work out how to deal with that aspect."
He said that there are other factors that could be contributing to lower-than-usual clam numbers, including environmental changes and the early emergence of predators.
"Last year, because of the weather and environmental factors, there was too much rain when clam larvae were setting and they didn't settle down on the flats," Nault said. "Also, green crabs came out and ate those larvae, which is a whole other issue."
Neoplasia is a disease that has been around for a long time and is one that doesn't usually give biologists a second thought, Nault said. But its high prevalence in Casco Bay and areas just outside the bay are cause for question.
"We're trying to figure out if we're seeing it higher in juvenile clams and if it's a localized issue, in a specific cove," Nault said. "One of the complexities of Harpswell is that they have been moving clams around for quite a while, so we have to eliminate where they were moving them, where they got the seeds from and where they moved them to."
The "$64 million question" is how to control the problem so that it doesn't effect future generations of clams, he said.
"We don't know (what's going on)," he said. "It's hard to pinpoint in each area. They do have, in certain areas, neoplasia killing both adult and seed clams. When we do plantings or transplanting, we have to think about how we work around those areas."
Nault said that he and a team of two other biologists will continue to study the problem in Harpswell and the nearby environs to come up with a solution that will bolster clam populations. The quick reaction of the Harpswell Marine Resources Committee allows them to get a jump on the problem, even though, at the moment, it has the team perplexed, he said.
"They certainly have clams in Harpswell, and they're growing. But in other areas they're not," Nault said. "You can stare at West Bath from Harpswell, and those areas are doing perfectly fine, not having that kind of an issue, so why is that? We're kind of scratching our heads trying to figure it out."

Abstract: "It's been an amazing experience so far," said [Michelle Ragussis]. "I've learned a lot from everyone, most importantly to just be yourself and be true to yourself." Ragussis made her Food Network debut a few years ago, with appearances on "Chopped" and "24 Hour Restaurant Battle." For "Food Network Star," she has been placed on Bobby Flay's team of contestants, and she has made everything from Steamed Mussels with Chorizo for a challenge to create a restaurant menu in one day, to Spaghetti Squash with Turkey Meatballs for a challenge to cook for kids. On the season finale, the top three finalists will compete for votes from viewers to see who will be named the next Food Network Star. "The votes are what will really help me, if I make it that far," said Ragussis. "I've definitely got my fingers crossed."

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Michelle Ragussis has a lot of energy -- for Maine, for her Italian and Greek heritage, and for her No. 1 passion: cooking. This summer, she's making her signature Mediterranean-inspired New England cuisine at The Pearl Restaurant, right on the waterfront in Rockland.
She's also -- along with TV viewers across the country -- watching herself compete on "Food Network Star," airing at 9 p.m. on Sundays, as one of 15 contestants vying for their own original Food Network series. Week six just aired, and Ragussis is still in competition -- though at the end of the show, viewer votes are what will take her to the next level.
"It's been an amazing experience so far," said Ragussis. "I've learned a lot from everyone, most importantly to just be yourself and be true to yourself."
Ragussis, 42, grew up in Bristol, R.I., among a strong Portuguese community, which greatly informed her cooking -- she's a big fan of mixing meat ingredients with seafood, and is particularly fond of ingredients such as chorizo sausage, kale and shellfish. She has cooked in Rhode Island, New York and Florida, which is where she met Jimmy Fanning, who owned several restaurants down south before moving to Maine and opening The Pearl.
"I had so much fun working with him back then, I knew I wanted to come back to New England," said Ragussis. "And Rockland is just gorgeous."
Ragussis made her Food Network debut a few years ago, with appearances on "Chopped" and "24 Hour Restaurant Battle." For "Food Network Star," she has been placed on Bobby Flay's team of contestants, and she has made everything from Steamed Mussels with Chorizo for a challenge to create a restaurant menu in one day, to Spaghetti Squash with Turkey Meatballs for a challenge to cook for kids. On the season finale, the top three finalists will compete for votes from viewers to see who will be named the next Food Network Star.
"The votes are what will really help me, if I make it that far," said Ragussis. "I've definitely got my fingers crossed."
Michelle Ragussis' Littleneck Clams with Chorizo

Full text: RUMFORD -- Nineteen Mountain Valley High School students exhibited characteristics of scholarship, leadership, service and character and earned a nomination to the MVHS chapter of National Honor Society. They learned of their selection during a recent school-wide assembly.
As the students entered Muskie Auditorium, the MVHS jazz ensemble played. The assembly began with the Pledge of Allegiance and National Anthem sung a capella by Mariana DeRoche, Heather Durfee, Jamaica Ford, Alexa Fryover, Morgan Gordon, Victoria Gordon, Ashleigh Milligan, Adele Oswald and Leah Perry.
Katie Billings, president, and Cam Welch, vice president, thanked the faculty council for their work in nominating the new members. They introduced chapter officers and summarized the service projects, including a food drive for the local food pantry, the book drive and school supplies for the "I Care" bags. Inside the school, the members led a recycling project and tutored other students.
Billings, who serves as the public relations officer at the state level, highlighted the recent state convention. "The theme of this year's convention was 'finding the best in yourself,'" Billings said. "One way the state NHS demonstrated this was through our service projects. Statewide, we collected more than 6000 books for World Wide Book Drive, more than 200 'I care bags' for elementary school students and blankets for Project Linus."
Newly-elected Maine NHS secretary Garrett Carver said, "Leadership is a trait that NHS stands for. A true leader must want to lead, desire to help others, direct and organize events, desire to provide a good example, and desire to listen to others and promote collaboration."
The NHS chapter recognized the following staff members for their service to the chapter: Matt Gilbert, Jim Aylward, Debra Buotte, Chris Decker, Craig Dilman, Mary Gamble, Tami Jamison, Peggy LaPointe, Donna Peare, Michael Prescott and Lorraine Tanguay. Each received a carnation.
Next, faculty and staff members who became NHS members previously joined the current NHS students on the stage.
Kyle Gauvin read a poem, "The Oyster." The poem describes an oyster with a grain of sand under its shell. The oyster endures pain and hardship and the result is a beautiful pearl.
Current NHS students reviewed each of the four characteristics of an NHS member. Billings discussed scholarship, Cody Smith explained service, Jamaica Ford talked about character and Samantha Glover concluded with leadership.
For the tapping ceremony, a current member walked out into the audience and announced the name of a nominee. The nominee was escorted to the stage and draped with an NHS sash.
The induction ceremony will be at 2 p.m. Sunday, May 6, in the Muskie Auditorium.
The new NHS members include Rachel Averill, Shawn Bennett, Andrew Boucher, Kellie Dyment, Chelsea DeRoehn, Taylor Dickson, Nathan Fitzpatrick, Chandler Gallant, Makenzie Gallant, Victoria Giberson, Devarae Gurney, Ellie Hall, Ryan Nicols, Jonathan Petrie, Abbey Pinkham, Katie Puiia, Joshua Rainey, Mariah Witas and Kasey Zadakis.

Temperatures in Gulf of Maine higher than normal

Abstract: The winter's warm air temperatures have helped drive up water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, in line with a continuing trend, and the warm waters could result in lobsters molting their shells earlier than usual and ocean algae blooming ahead of schedule. "Higher temperature means higher growth rates, but it also means they require more food in order to attain those higher growth rates," he said. "But whether there'll be more food around, I don't know." "The question now is whether this is something similar to that warm period in the '50s, or if this is something different, because we have other forces, we have more (carbon dioxide) being put in the air than 50 or 60 years ago," he said. "You can't say what happened in the '50s will happen now, that it'll go down. That's not so clear. Who knows?"

Full text: PORTLAND -- The winter's warm air temperatures have helped drive up water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, in line with a continuing trend, and the warm waters could result in lobsters molting their shells earlier than usual and ocean algae blooming ahead of schedule.
In the long run are questions around how rising ocean temperatures might affect the growth and reproduction cycles and distribution of fish and shellfish, whales, zooplankton and other marine life throughout the gulf.
Temperature affects all life processes, but it's too soon to say if changes brought on by rising water temperatures will be good or bad, said Jeffrey Runge, a biological oceanographer at the University of Maine and a researcher at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland.
"Higher temperature means higher growth rates, but it also means they require more food in order to attain those higher growth rates," he said. "But whether there'll be more food around, I don't know."
Gulf of Maine water temperatures have been rising gradually since at least the 1870s, with ups and downs along the way. But the increase has been pronounced in the past decade or so, in the general range of 2 to 5 degrees depending on the ocean depth, Runge said.
The temperature rise in recent years is similar to the 1950s, when the Gulf of Maine warmed up rapidly before falling later, Runge said Thursday in a phone interview from Spain, where he was attending a marine science meeting.
"The question now is whether this is something similar to that warm period in the '50s, or if this is something different, because we have other forces, we have more (carbon dioxide) being put in the air than 50 or 60 years ago," he said. "You can't say what happened in the '50s will happen now, that it'll go down. That's not so clear. Who knows?"
For lobsters, the warmer temperatures could mean they molt their shells and make their annual trek from offshore to nearshore waters earlier in the year. Shrimp could hatch their eggs earlier in the winter. In time, cod and other fish could migrate to the eastern part of the gulf -- or out of the gulf altogether -- in search of colder waters.
If the waters keep heating up, some scientists speculate that a plankton species, Calanus finmarchicus, that is a key prey for herring, mackerel, right whales and other forage species, could diminish or even disappear from the Gulf of Maine.
And there are questions on ripple effects. For instance, warm water could result in shrimp eggs hatching earlier than in the past. But the hatching dates could come before the phytoplankton bloom that shrimp larvae feed upon.
"These are all angles that you'd need to look into to determine what the effects are going to be," said Dave Townsend, an oceanographer at the University of Maine.
Air temperatures in Portland have been well above normal for seven consecutive months, and last week's regional warm spell shattered temperature records across the state for days in a row. Those warm temperatures can also be found in the ocean.
Last Friday, at the tail end of a warm streak, the surface water at a buoy in Casco Bay near Portland came in at 45.5 degrees, or roughly 6 to 10 degrees higher than the same date in any of the past 10 years. At another buoy in Penobscot Bay, off the state's midcoast, the water temperature was 3 to 9 degrees warmer than readings in the past decade.
The Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal and Observing Systems monitors a series of buoys throughout the Gulf of Maine, which stretches from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia. The association collects data on water and air temperatures, wind speed and direction, wave height, and salinity levels.
Water temperatures have been increasing in recent years at all buoys and at all water depths, said Ru Morrison, executive director of NERACOOS, based in Rye, N.H.
"It's warming everywhere, at slightly different rates," he said.

Abstract: "He was in the house," Sherwood said. "He used to watch TV with us at night and jump up on the couch. And he'd eat oyster crackers. That's what he liked." "Thousands and thousands of rabbits are being euthanized all over the United States because there's not enough room in the shelters themselves. They're already inundated with cats and dogs," [Myers] said. "People don't know how to take care of rabbits in most shelters, and they put them in a little guinea pig cage and then people come in to try to adopt them and they bite because they're territorial.

Full text: VASSALBORO -- Bertha and her companions were once lab rabbits, subjected to eye drops that made them scream.
Phoenix was stuffed into a plastic Hannaford bag and thrown out on the side of the road. He was found with a broken leg.
Pretty Girl and her mate were left on someone's front lawn. Her mate was hit and killed by a car before they could be rescued.
But at David and Cheryl Sherwood's Vassalboro home, Bertha, Phoenix, Pretty Girl, and 48 other rescued rabbits sprint across the fenced-in yard, nibble on pine boughs or lounge, fat and happy, in the shade.
"We're their last stop usually," David Sherwood said, tossing cracker treats to Bertha and a couple of other big, white former lab rabbits. "We try to give them the best we can until bunny heaven."
For the past several years, Sherwood and his wife have been bunny devotees. It started with an abandoned baby rabbit they found at an apartment complex they were overseeing. They named him Bunny. Sherwood called him "Boo."
"He was in the house," Sherwood said. "He used to watch TV with us at night and jump up on the couch. And he'd eat oyster crackers. That's what he liked."
After Bunny died, they got another rabbit. Then another one as a companion for him.
"Next thing we know we met Quan," he said.
The owner of the nonprofit Rabbitats for Humanity in Walpole, Maine, Quan Myers has been rescuing rabbits for 10 years. She talked the couple through some behavioral issues they were having with one of their rabbits. They were moved by her passion for the animals and by her "rabbitat,"a sprawling outdoor space with places for the rabbits to run, hide, eat, sleep and play.
"Thousands and thousands of rabbits are being euthanized all over the United States because there's not enough room in the shelters themselves. They're already inundated with cats and dogs," Myers said. "People don't know how to take care of rabbits in most shelters, and they put them in a little guinea pig cage and then people come in to try to adopt them and they bite because they're territorial. 'This is my space, it's only 2 feet wide. You can't put your hand in here.'"
But while Myers has rescued 1,500 to 1,800 rabbits over the past decade, health problems forced her to cut back. A few years ago, the Sherwoods offered to take some of her brood.
The couple built their own rabbitat beside their house, fencing in a plot of land and filling it with bunny-sized buildings and lean-tos. The area is divided into sections with fencing to separate argumentative bunnies, a roof to keep out predators and an outside area for rabbits that like to lie in the sun or nibble on twigs.
Above one door the Sherwoods have hung the sign, "Beware of attack rabbit," ironic since none of their bunnies do anything more aggressive than nudge for treats.
Over the past few years, the Sherwoods have taken more of Myers' rabbits. Most of their 51 were hers at one time, and she pays for their care and medical needs. But many were rescued by the couple, adopted from a local animal shelter where they would have been euthanized, or taken in when a former owner could no longer care for them.
Although Myers sometimes finds homes for her rabbits, the Sherwoods have never allowed a bunny adoption. Sherwood considers theirs a home of last resort, and he expects all the rabbits will stay there throughout their lives.
"Once they're here they're just pets," he said.
It's a lot of work and expense. The rabbits go through 100 pounds of pellets a week, plus pounds more of apples, carrots and other treats. The rabbitat must be cleaned regularly and the rabbits must be checked throughout the day to ensure no one is sick or hurt.
But Sherwood loves watching them.
"Especially when you make a new area. They're out there binkying and jumping around and playing," he said, referring to the happy dancing-jump that rabbit lovers call a "binky." He glanced down at one of the former lab bunnies who ate his cracker too fast. "Or when they get the hiccups."
Nearly all of the rabbits have settled into bonded pairs or small groups. Although most live outside in the rabbitat, six of the rabbits live in the house. The couple has rabbit-proofed the home, but they've still lost a few lamps to curious wire-chewers and their baseboards have been nibbled.
"They've got beauty marks, that's what I call them," Sherwood said.
At 51 animals (plus a once-stray indoor cat that likes to munch on the bunnies' food), the couple consider their rabbit rescue full. They aren't accepting new rabbits.
But Sherwood has advice to help ensure more rabbits don't need to be rescued: Don't get bunnies for Easter. Don't get them as pets for children or as a gift for someone else. Keep in mind that rabbits are curious, mischievous and take a lot of work to care for. Get them spayed or neutered.
Sherwood said he never thought he'd be a bunny guy, but apparently he is.
"I just like rabbits," he said.

Full text: ORONO -- Maine Sea Grant and the University of Maine Cooperative Extension announce the appointment of Sarah Redmond of Hancock as marine extension associate.
Based at the Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research in Franklin, Redmond will be working with Maine's aquaculture industry to develop and advance ecologically-based methods of growing marine macroalgae (sea vegetables or seaweed).
A native of Litchfield, Redmond received a bachelor's degree in aquaculture from the University of Maine in 2003 and completed a master's degree in marine botany at the University of Connecticut in December 2011. Her graduate research focused on potential climate change impacts on kelp. She also developed seed culture methods for seaweed species native to the Northeast. She will continue to work on these techniques while establishing a seaweed nursery system at the CCAR facility.
Before graduate school, Redmond held positions as a fisheries observer and researcher with NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, a conservation aide in the National Marine Shellfish Sanitation Program in the Maine Department of Marine Resources, a sternman on a lobster boat out of Port Clyde, and a technician in the shellfish hatchery of the former Marshall Point Sea Farm.
Redmond brings her skills to the Maine Marine Extension Team, a partnership between Maine Sea Grant and University of Maine Cooperative Extension. As a member of the MET, she will be available to assist coastal communities with questions, concerns, and information needs, especially those related to aquaculture, the seafood industry, and sea vegetable production. She may be contacted at sarah.redmond@maine.edu or 841-3221.

AUBURN -- Nicole Stephanie Goulet and Christopher James Formidoni were married on June 18 at the Hilton Garden Inn. Richard Formidoni, brother of the bridegroom officiated the ceremony.
The bride is the daughter of Steven and Rachel Goulet of Greene. The bridegroom is the son of Dee and Lynn Formidoni of Titusville, N.J.
Walked down the aisle by her father, the bride wore an oyster semi-sweetheart, fit-and-flare gown embellished with gray and blue embroidery and white crystals. As her borrowed, old and blue, the bride wore a necklace and earrings of light blue stones dating back to the 1950s. The set was given to her grandmother by her grandfather when they began courting 60 years ago. The bride also carried a bouquet of blue and green hydrangea and roses.
Christine Spin, the sister of the bride, stood as her matron of honor. Bridesmaids were Beth Baron, Kristy Phinney, Jennifer Folker, Elizabeth Formidoni, sister of the bridegroom, and Alison Dembe. The flower girl was Camila Mendez, niece of the bridegroom.
The bridegroom waited at the end of the aisle. A silver basket, held by his mother as she walked down the aisle more than 40 years ago, was filled with flowers and sat on the couple's table at the reception.
Peter Formidoni, brother of the bridegroom, served as best man. Groomsmen were Justin Seymour, Richard Formidoni, also brother of the bridegroom, Jan Spin, brother-in-law of the bride, Bradley Trullinger, Jeff Carroll and Daniel Lageman.
The bride is a graduate of the University of Orono, where she received a master's degree in communication. She is employed at Ralph Lauren on their employee communications team in New York City.
The bridegroom is a graduate of the University of New Hampshire, where he received a bachelor's degree in political science. He manages the bar at Amber, a restaurant located in the West Village in New York City.
Immediately after the wedding, they mini-honeymooned at Harvey Cedars in Long Beach Island, N.J. They will travel to Argentina and Uruguay for their honeymoon which is planned for February. They currently reside in New York City.

Eats: LaRochelle's Seafood -- Shrimpfest, fresh from the sea

Author: DeCoster, Ruth

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]22 Jan 2012.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/917103567?accountid=10457

Abstract: Offering proof that he's been cleaning shrimp all his life is an old, framed newspaper article from March 14, 1969, hanging on the wall featuring a photo of [Neil LaRochelle] at age 2 cleaning away. In the article, his mother is quoted as saying "Shrimp is a good substitute for lobster, and less expensive." Since the same holds true 43 years later -- and also because it's shrimp season -- LaRochelle borrowed a few of his favorite recipes from her well-worn, hand-written cook book and shared them with us. My ears perked up when he mentioned "shrimp dip." Before I knew it, I had sampled small dollops of it on Ritz crackers, written down the recipe, and was happy to hear the dip is almost always kept in stock in his cooler (small containers for $5). He laughingly said his family tends to make this dip for almost any holiday or special occasion -- and every time they eat it someone will say "This is the best ever!" I found the dip to be the perfect complement to that night's light supper of spinach salad and a cup of LaRochelle's fish chowder. Typically from Mother's Day through Thanksgiving, LaRochelle's sells individual "lobster clambakes" (including one lobster, a pound of clams, corn on the cob and a few baby red potatoes, all wrapped up in a mesh bag) usually for $15. Because he knows most of his customers are looking for convenience, he will cook them for you. "You just have to bring it home, dump it on a plate and it's ready to eat." (Just think: A mess-free, smell-free kitchen!) They also offer the service of lobster cooking. Just call in your order and it will be ready when you get there.

Full text: Neil LaRochelle offers a few tips on preparing and cooking Maine shrimp at www.sunjournal.com.
Always Fresh LaRochelle's Seafood
22 Mill St., Auburn
782-3150
Winter hours: 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
LaRochelle's shrimp Tip of the Day: If you soak your fresh shrimp in a bucket of ice water for at least 12 hours before peeling, the shells will slip away from the shrimp meat much more easily.
LaRochelle's Shrimp Dip
3 ounces cream cheese
1 cup sour cream
1 package Good Seasons Mild Italian Salad Dressing
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 cup fresh Maine shrimp, cooked and chopped (or 1 can, drained thoroughly)
Mix all together. Blend well. Refrigerate and enjoy with crackers, chips or pretzels.
Shrimp Chop Suey
4 tablespoons butter, divided
1 to 2 cups shrimp
1 cup onions, sliced
2 cups celery, sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 cup hot water
1 can Chinese bean sprouts or 1 bag fresh bean sprouts
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons cornstarch
Saute onions in 3 tablespoons butter for about 3 minutes. Add celery, hot water, salt and pepper. Cover and cook 5 to 10 minutes. Stir often.
Saute shrimp in remaining butter for about 2 minutes. Add sprouts to the celery and onion, cook a few minutes. Add shrimp. Heat to the boiling point. Combine soy sauce, sugar, water and cornstarch. Add to the shrimp mixture. Cook and stir for a few minutes to thicken. Serve with Chinese noodles or rice. Says Mrs. LaRochelle: "This is great made with scallops, or a combination of shrimp and scallops. Also great with mushrooms added."
Shrimp Wiggle
4 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2 cups milk
1 to 2 cups fresh cooked shrimp
1 cup cooked peas
In a small saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Add flour, salt and pepper, stirring constantly with wire whisk. Add milk slowly; cook and stir until mixture is smooth and thick. Fold in shrimp and peas. Serve on pastry shells or toast points. "A few shakes of sherry wine gives wonderful flavor to this shrimp dish."
"Always fresh!" is how Neil LaRochelle answers the phone at his seafood restaurant and market in New Auburn.
You know what he means when you see him surrounded by hundreds of pounds of fresh-from-the-sea shrimp in the back room of the small establishment, located at 22 Mill St.
Offering proof that he's been cleaning shrimp all his life is an old, framed newspaper article from March 14, 1969, hanging on the wall featuring a photo of LaRochelle at age 2 cleaning away. In the article, his mother is quoted as saying "Shrimp is a good substitute for lobster, and less expensive." Since the same holds true 43 years later -- and also because it's shrimp season -- LaRochelle borrowed a few of his favorite recipes from her well-worn, hand-written cook book and shared them with us.
One of his all-time favorite shrimp dishes is Shrimp Chop Suey, he said. Its great flavor, he believes, is provided by the sauce. He also shared a fun recipe from his childhood (and probably that of many others') called Shrimp Wiggle, which he considers delicious. His family served it on toast points or puffed pastry shells (unlike others, who -- I confess with some chagrin -- took the less cultured route of scrunched-up saltine crackers).
My ears perked up when he mentioned "shrimp dip." Before I knew it, I had sampled small dollops of it on Ritz crackers, written down the recipe, and was happy to hear the dip is almost always kept in stock in his cooler (small containers for $5). He laughingly said his family tends to make this dip for almost any holiday or special occasion -- and every time they eat it someone will say "This is the best ever!" I found the dip to be the perfect complement to that night's light supper of spinach salad and a cup of LaRochelle's fish chowder.
And when it comes to chowder, Always Fresh LaRochelle's Seafood offers up some of the best in town -- winning prizes in chowder competitions in 2006, 2007 and 2011. As the youngest of six children, his stay-at-home mom taught him a lot about cooking, and his chowder started off with her recipe, which he has since perfected. Quarts of the fish chowder run $10 ($5 for a pint) and seafood chowder is $12 (or $6 for a pint).
In spite of its size, the fish market, also does double duty as a seafood restaurant -- "all take-out," he said. His customers don't seem to mind the absence of dining tables or counter stools. They plan in advance to either bring their meals home or "picnic" in their cars.
"I wanted to keep it simple," he said, and has no plans to expand any time soon. "I have reasonable prices, and serve a good quantity of food." Daily specials are offered, usually using a fish or seafood that is in season, or perhaps something great he picked up that day directly off a fishing boat or at market.
Typically from Mother's Day through Thanksgiving, LaRochelle's sells individual "lobster clambakes" (including one lobster, a pound of clams, corn on the cob and a few baby red potatoes, all wrapped up in a mesh bag) usually for $15. Because he knows most of his customers are looking for convenience, he will cook them for you. "You just have to bring it home, dump it on a plate and it's ready to eat." (Just think: A mess-free, smell-free kitchen!) They also offer the service of lobster cooking. Just call in your order and it will be ready when you get there.
The market consistently stocks yellow fin tuna, salmon (usually farm-raised, although sometimes wild), scallops and oysters (both native and from Chesapeake Bay). They sell a lot of haddock, which he said is fresh-cut and filleted right in the store. His main focus is quality control, he said. "It's the biggest thing about keeping customers happy." Also in the cooler (beside that fresh shrimp dip), you will find crab meat, Black Tigers (large cocktail shrimp), clear lobster meat and his home-made seafood stuffing.
For convenient one-stop-shopping, he stocks a few marinades, bread items, potato chips and drinks.
He said this year's shrimp season is expected to be much shorter and smaller than that of 2011. Last year's haul was approximately 12 million pounds, whereas this year's will end when they reach 4 million pounds. If possible, LaRochelle tries to stock his freezers with about 1,500 pounds of fresh shrimp, which he will use in meals and chowders through the fall.

George Gervais: Governor pushing for more jobs

Abstract: Improving Maine's business climate and moving the economy forward is a marathon, not a sprint. The LePage administration's approach to sustainable prosperity is bold and our commitment relentless. The mission is clear -- lower the cost of energy, prepare our workforce for 21st century job opportunities and build an overall foundation for economic growth. Since January 2011, Maine's unemployment rate has decreased and is currently at 7.3 percent. This rate is well below the national average and below the New England average, yet Gov. Paul LePage knows we can do better. The governor and his administration are committed to paving the way for more private sector job growth and putting Mainers back to work. Here are just some of the more than 50 Maine businesses poised to grow and add jobs: Allagash Brewing in Portland, Harvey Metals in Brunswick; LaJoie Growers in Van Buren; PRL Hancock, LLC, in Hancock; Core Logix in Biddeford; Azarias International in Biddeford; Tasman Industries in Hartland; Shad's Custom Countertops in Windham; Front Street Shipyard in Belfast; Maine Coast Shellfish in York; Ocean Renewable Power in Eastport; TrueLine Publishing in Portland; and Great Northern Timber in Millinocket.

Full text: Improving Maine's business climate and moving the economy forward is a marathon, not a sprint. The LePage administration's approach to sustainable prosperity is bold and our commitment relentless. The mission is clear -- lower the cost of energy, prepare our workforce for 21st century job opportunities and build an overall foundation for economic growth.
Since January 2011, Maine's unemployment rate has decreased and is currently at 7.3 percent. This rate is well below the national average and below the New England average, yet Gov. Paul LePage knows we can do better. The governor and his administration are committed to paving the way for more private sector job growth and putting Mainers back to work.
Although some predictions from some experts paint a less than optimistic outlook for the economy and job creation going forward, the facts indicate otherwise.
Cutting red tape and regulatory reform through LD 1 was a terrific start. Government can no longer get in the way of job creation. The business community now has a willing partner in Augusta.
Gone are the days where state government will be viewed as an obstacle to prosperity.
One example is here at the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development, where there is now a team of governor's account executives. This team will serve as the one resource for business owners to help guide them through the process of starting a business, expanding or relocating. That work is already paying off.
Hundreds of people are heading back to work in the Millinocket region as the governor led an effort to reopen the Katahdin region mills.
Earlier this month, Carbonite, the leading provider of online backup solutions, relocated its customer support operations from India to Lewiston, bringing 150 new jobs.
Hinckley Yachts in Southwest Harbor is planning an expansion and an additional 50 new jobs. The list goes on and on.
Here are just some of the more than 50 Maine businesses poised to grow and add jobs: Allagash Brewing in Portland, Harvey Metals in Brunswick; LaJoie Growers in Van Buren; PRL Hancock, LLC, in Hancock; Core Logix in Biddeford; Azarias International in Biddeford; Tasman Industries in Hartland; Shad's Custom Countertops in Windham; Front Street Shipyard in Belfast; Maine Coast Shellfish in York; Ocean Renewable Power in Eastport; TrueLine Publishing in Portland; and Great Northern Timber in Millinocket.
Aside from the numerous on-the-ground examples of jobs being created, recent data reinforces the fact that Gov. LePage's policies and initiatives are indeed creating job opportunities for Mainers.
Since July 2011, the number of people employed in Maine increased by more than 3,000, and unemployment decreased from 7.7 percent to 7.3 percent -- the lowest rate Maine has experienced since December 2008.
It is no coincidence that this increase in employment comes right on the heels of a legislative session that produced a fiscally responsible biennial budget and numerous policy initiatives specifically targeted at creating an environment that allows job creators to thrive.
At the governor's recent Job Creation Workshops held in South Portland, Bangor and Auburn, administration officials heard directly from job creators. Many spoke about the need for a better trained workforce.
Maine's seven community colleges are well aware of this problem and are embracing the challenge. For example, Northern Maine Community College's newly renovated welding lab is a state-of-the-art facility that will help train our future workforce so they can take advantage of the many good paying trade and technical occupations available now and in the future.
The business community also spoke out about our high cost of energy and how it is killing job opportunities in Maine. Gov. LePage has said on several occasions that he will continue to promote any energy source that achieves one goal -- lowering the cost for commercial and residential ratepayers.
Growing the economy will require a balanced approach -- the private sector and state government working together.
Maine's business climate has changed in the past 11 months and will continue to improve under the leadership of Gov. LePage. Clearly the private sector is taking notice.
George Gervais is commissioner of the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development.

A delightful social hour followed the oyster supper served to the clerks of the Atherton Furniture Co. Lewiston last evening. The spread was laid in the drapery room where pastries of all kinds, fruits and confections were served. The oyster stew was cooked by an expert in the basement and is said to have been all that could be desired in the stew line.
After the feed remarks were made by Manager Lungrin and some of the clerks. Later an informal musical program was enjoyed and a social hour followed.
50 years ago, 1961
Auburn Police Chief Alton E. Savage said last night that the two young men who held up a taxicab driver on Center Street Thursday nigh apparently have made a successful getaway from this area. Police continued checking all possible leads throughout yesterday but the chief said there are no new developments.
Joseph Michaud, a driver for Fern's Taxi Inc., was held up by the two young men who reportedly held a pistol at Michaud's head and made off with his money bag which contained $6.
25 years ago, 1986
SABATTUS -- Selectmen rejected a suggestion to spend tax dollars for advertising on placemats at local restaurants at Monday night's meeting.
Police Chief Guy Desjardins, saying he was making the suggestion on behalf of others who approached him, went to selectmen with the idea. He said Lisbon advertises in this manner.
Selectmen suggested that if the town considered advertising in the future, they would like to see it used for attracting tourism and business development.

Vitamin-mineral treatment for macular degeneration

Author: Anonymous

Abstract: ANSWER: In 2001, the results of the first AREDS report (Age-Related Eye Disease Study) was published. It showed that the combination of beta carotene (a form of vitamin A), vitamin E, vitamin C, zinc and copper could slow the progression of moderate macular degeneration to severe macular degeneration. Macular degeneration is a wasting away of the macula -- a small, round area of the retina necessary for clear central vision, the kind needed to read, sew and drive. Ocuvite is one capsule that incorporates all these nutrients. ANSWER: Keppra is a respected seizure-control medicine. In a few patients, it causes sleepiness and dizziness. In fewer still, it brings on behavior changes like irritability and aggressiveness. Seizure-control medicines can't be stopped suddenly. They have to be tapered so that the person doesn't have another seizure. Talk to your husband's doctor about the possibility of getting your husband off Keppra or switching to a different medicine.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I am an 82-year-old woman. My body cannot tolerate antibiotics, vitamins or painkillers. I am told I have macular degeneration and was advised to take Ocuvite once a day. My sister suggested I write to you to see if you have an idea of how to take Ocuvite in some other manner or some other way to get the ingredients in it. Help. -- L.M.
ANSWER: In 2001, the results of the first AREDS report (Age-Related Eye Disease Study) was published. It showed that the combination of beta carotene (a form of vitamin A), vitamin E, vitamin C, zinc and copper could slow the progression of moderate macular degeneration to severe macular degeneration. Macular degeneration is a wasting away of the macula -- a small, round area of the retina necessary for clear central vision, the kind needed to read, sew and drive. Ocuvite is one capsule that incorporates all these nutrients.
Currently a new study, AREDS 2, is being conducted. The vitamin-mineral combination has been altered a bit and new ingredients have been added: lutein, zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids. Some Ocuvite pills also contain these materials.
Since you're unable to tolerate vitamins, you'll need to get these nutrients from foods. You might not be able to reach the high levels found in pills, but you'd be getting all the ingredients in those pills.
Beta carotene is found in colored vegetables like carrots and peppers, in dark-green vegetables and in colored fruits. Vitamin E is widely available in many foods: meats, nuts, cereal grains, wheat-germ oil and sunflower oil. You find vitamin C in citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes and broccoli. Zinc is in meats, shellfish, nuts and legumes, like peas. Copper is in shellfish, nuts and organ meats.
The new version of AREDS, not yet published, contains lutein and zeaxanthin, which you can obtain in kale, spinach, collard greens, corn, green beans, carrots, squash and tomatoes. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish like salmon and tuna.
The booklet on macular degeneration explains this common malady and its treatment. To obtain a copy, write: Dr. Donohue -- No. 701, Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Enclose a check or money order (no cash) for $4.75 U.S./$6 Can. with the recipient's printed name and address. Please allow four weeks for delivery.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: What can I do to get rid of a carbuncle? I have had it for four months. -- M.G.
ANSWER: Carbuncles are huge boils that penetrate more deeply than do boils. They have to be opened and drained of the pus within them. Antibiotics generally are prescribed, too.
Often, the antibiotic chosen has to be one that's effective against MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staph aureus, pronounced "mersa"). MRSA is one of the new supergerms that are touched only by a few, rarely prescribed antibiotics. Carbuncles are found most often on the neck, back, thighs and buttocks. You must have a doctor treat them. You're not going to meet with success on your own.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Two and a half years ago, my husband was hospitalized. He was given all kinds of tests and finally was diagnosed as having had a seizure.
He was put on Keppra. We noticed that he was becoming disoriented and forgetful. He had more tests. Alzheimer's was ruled out. Could Keppra be causing this? -- J.M.
ANSWER: Keppra is a respected seizure-control medicine. In a few patients, it causes sleepiness and dizziness. In fewer still, it brings on behavior changes like irritability and aggressiveness. Seizure-control medicines can't be stopped suddenly. They have to be tapered so that the person doesn't have another seizure. Talk to your husband's doctor about the possibility of getting your husband off Keppra or switching to a different medicine.
Dr. Donohue regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but he will incorporate them in his column whenever possible.

Abstract: LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): You'll be torn between what you want to do and your responsibilities. Don't waste time arguing when you should be moving quickly to free up the time you need to do as you please. An unusual interest will give you something to think about. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): You have the edge and can match any challenge. Don't lead someone on or you will face an emotional situation that is difficult to fix. Honesty will count, no matter what or whom you are dealing with. You can do well in business as long as you aren't swallowed up by personal obligations.

Full text: CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Sara Ramirez, 36; Zack Ward, 41; Jonathan LaPaglia, 42; Richard Gere, 62.
Happy Birthday: Don't let uncertainty be your nemesis when you have so much to gain by taking action and following through. The world is your oyster; you just have to recognize what you have to offer. Once you get behind your skills and talents, so will everyone around you. Believe in you, and don't stop until you reach your goals.
ARIES (March 21-April 19): Take your time and do a great job. Don't give in to someone pressuring you to make a decision. You have to establish your position so that you send a clear message to any trying to manipulate you.
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Don't back away from controversy when you should step up and own the spotlight. Show everyone your strength of character and that you cannot be bought. Network with people who have strong opinions; you will end up collaborating and coming up with a doable deal.
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Impulse spending must be curbed to stay within your budget. Keep an open mind and you will find a solution to a problem that has been hanging over your head. Don't neglect the ones you love.
CANCER (June 21-July 22): Don't allow anyone to take up your time with matters that aren't important to you. Focus on the things that need immediate attention. A rash decision that will affect your professional position or personal status must be avoided.
LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Put everything else aside and concentrate on getting ahead professionally. Whether you sign up for a course or apprenticeship that will help you earn more money, or apply for a better position, you will make your way to greater financial freedom. Good fortune awaits you if you strive to reach your goals.
VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Talk to your peers about ideas you would like to implement. Love should be your main concern during the evening hours. Don't be afraid to share your feelings and your plans.
LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): You'll be torn between what you want to do and your responsibilities. Don't waste time arguing when you should be moving quickly to free up the time you need to do as you please. An unusual interest will give you something to think about.
SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): You have lots to consider before you make changes that will alter your future. Observe what the people around you do before you make a decision. Focus on your personal situation and how you can make it better.
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): You have the edge and can match any challenge. Don't lead someone on or you will face an emotional situation that is difficult to fix. Honesty will count, no matter what or whom you are dealing with. You can do well in business as long as you aren't swallowed up by personal obligations.
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Take care of personal papers, legal and financial matters, or anything you feel is your responsibility. Taking care of business quickly and efficiently will impress someone who has something to offer. Be leery of a joint venture.
AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): A settlement can be resolved that will help you financially, legally or emotionally. You may have to reciprocate if someone offers a helping hand. Clear up any confusion by asking pertinent questions before you move forward.
PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Don't procrastinate. Firm up any offer before someone steps in and takes your place. You can make professional moves that will help you earn more. A partnership with someone from your past will help bring you in touch with new people.
Birthday Baby: You are charming, witty, bright, compassionate and giving.

New mom insists that grandma leave her barking 'baby' home

Abstract: Mom adopted a small indoor dog about a month ago. "Trixie" is pint-sized, but she has a loud, high-pitched bark and she barks often. When Mom told me she plans to bring Trixie with her, I expressed concern that the constant barking will wake the baby and everyone else. I am also concerned about dander in the nursery from Trixie's long hair. I asked Mom to leave Trixie home with my father, but she said she just adopted her and doesn't want her to feel abandoned. I wouldn't mind her bringing Trixie on future visits, just not while we're adjusting to a new baby. DEAR O.B. AND C.: I'm not sure you should. If your husband had a female friend from work he had lunch with occasionally, I wouldn't be concerned. But emails, texts, phone calls and exchanging gifts seems excessive. Tell him his relationship with his "fun new friend" is making you uncomfortable and you need it toned down because you feel it's a threat to your marriage. If he cares about your feelings, he should pay attention to what you're saying.

Full text: DEAR ABBY: My husband and I are expecting our first child in a few months, and my mother, who lives out of state, will be flying in to help with the new baby. This will be her first grandchild.
Mom adopted a small indoor dog about a month ago. "Trixie" is pint-sized, but she has a loud, high-pitched bark and she barks often. When Mom told me she plans to bring Trixie with her, I expressed concern that the constant barking will wake the baby and everyone else. I am also concerned about dander in the nursery from Trixie's long hair.
I asked Mom to leave Trixie home with my father, but she said she just adopted her and doesn't want her to feel abandoned. I wouldn't mind her bringing Trixie on future visits, just not while we're adjusting to a new baby.
Am I being selfish to ask my mother to keep the dog at home when she comes to visit? -- GET ME OUT OF THE DOGHOUSE
DEAR DOGHOUSE: By the time your baby arrives, Trixie should have adjusted to both of your parents and should not feel abandoned if one of them leaves for a short while. Your needs and the needs of your household should take precedence over the needs of your mother's dog, and you are not being selfish to insist upon it.
DEAR ABBY: I have been married 24 years to a great guy. For the first time I am struggling with feelings of jealousy. My husband has begun a friendship with a female co-worker who is also married. They exchange emails, text messages and phone calls. They get together socially occasionally and have exchanged birthday and holiday gifts.
There's nothing "wrong" with what they're doing, and I feel my husband has the right to be friends with whomever he chooses. He loves me and treats me well. I don't want to feel or act like a crazy, jealous wife. But I have a hard time when I see how he enjoys his fun new friend -- who, by the way, is young and great looking. How can I overcome my jealousy? -- OLD BALL AND CHAIN
DEAR O.B. AND C.: I'm not sure you should. If your husband had a female friend from work he had lunch with occasionally, I wouldn't be concerned. But emails, texts, phone calls and exchanging gifts seems excessive. Tell him his relationship with his "fun new friend" is making you uncomfortable and you need it toned down because you feel it's a threat to your marriage. If he cares about your feelings, he should pay attention to what you're saying.
DEAR ABBY: As a former paramedic and also a food allergy sufferer, I'm acutely aware of the problems caused by this condition. Food allergies vary widely and are not limited to common ones -- nuts, shellfish, gluten or strawberries. We know what we are allergic to, and we do our best to avoid those foods.
Sometimes it's difficult to tell what's in some tasty-looking dishes at potluck gatherings. An ingredient may be used only for seasoning, but sometimes just a trace of it is all it takes to trigger a reaction. That's why I have established a practice that has always been well received. I print out a card to attach to the dish I brought. On it I name the dish and list the ingredients.
I hope you'll find this suggestion helpful enough to pass along. It could save a life. -- JOE IN JANESVILLE, MINN.
DEAR JOE: You're right; it could -- and that's why I'm printing it. I met a widow whose husband suffered an allergic reaction and died at a dinner party, despite the frantic efforts of several physicians who were also in attendance. Forewarned is forearmed.

Freshwater shellfish not particularly tasty

Abstract: ANSWER: On [SUN SPOTS]' pond there is a cute little otter that makes quick work of freshwater shellfish, leaving the shells, which Mr. Sun Spots says are mussels, not clams, on the shore. Wikipedia.com relates the two, saying: "The common name mussel is used for members of several families of clams or bivalvia mollusca, from saltwater and freshwater habitats. These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval." "If they are in polluted water, they concentrate the toxins. This includes chemical pollution and bacterial pollution from sewage. Ocean shellfish like clams and oysters concentrate the red tide algae toxins. So the answer is that some clams can be deadly poisonous depending on what is in the water." "Many freshwater clams are edible, but I have never found any that were tasty enough to want to eat them. Clams are filter feeders and concentrate all the muck in the water. This means any pollution and the swampy smelling stuff. Crayfish are tasty little things though if you just cook and eat the tails. I have not tried snails, they don't get very big here and seem more bother than they are worth. Clams do make very good bait for fish and some of the animals that live near the water."

Full text: DEAR SUN SPOTS: I was talking with some people the other day about the clams that you find in freshwater. One person was saying they are safe to eat, while I and others say they are not. Is there any way you can clear this up? -- Roger, Cyrroger@yahoo.com
ANSWER: On Sun Spots' pond there is a cute little otter that makes quick work of freshwater shellfish, leaving the shells, which Mr. Sun Spots says are mussels, not clams, on the shore. Wikipedia.com relates the two, saying: "The common name mussel is used for members of several families of clams or bivalvia mollusca, from saltwater and freshwater habitats. These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval."
As for edibility, Wikipedia offers this: "Freshwater mussels nowadays are generally considered to be unpalatable, though the native peoples in North America ate them extensively. During the second World War in the United States, mussels were commonly served in diners. This was due to the unavailability of red meat related to wartime rationing."
Also online, Sun Spots found a number of comments about eating freshwater shellfish (mussels, clams and others), including the following from a hunting and fishing site (http://tinyurl.com/5wc5dbr).
"One word: Chewy."
"A few words: Cook them well. There are a lot of fun zoonotic parasites that freshwater snails can carry (liver flukes anyone?). That's one thing that having to sit through parasitology, etc. ... classes teaches you; just cook stuff."
"Look up your endangered species first before you go chowing down. Some stuff in freshwater like the Pearly Cats paw mussel are endangered and besides the ethical implications of eating one, if the law catches you, you can get stuck with a hefty fine."
"If they are in polluted water, they concentrate the toxins. This includes chemical pollution and bacterial pollution from sewage. Ocean shellfish like clams and oysters concentrate the red tide algae toxins. So the answer is that some clams can be deadly poisonous depending on what is in the water."
"Many freshwater clams are edible, but I have never found any that were tasty enough to want to eat them. Clams are filter feeders and concentrate all the muck in the water. This means any pollution and the swampy smelling stuff. Crayfish are tasty little things though if you just cook and eat the tails. I have not tried snails, they don't get very big here and seem more bother than they are worth. Clams do make very good bait for fish and some of the animals that live near the water."
Sun Spots also found an essay on Mother Earth News that indicates freshwater shellfish can be safe for people if taken from the right spot. But it also cited an elaborate cooking procedure. So the upshot seems to be that they may be edible if you know what you are doing and harvest from clean water, but they are not necessarily tasty enough to warrant all the work.
Mr. Sun Spots noted that if freshwater shellfish were tasty, they would already be commercially marketed, which doesn't seem to be the case. Perhaps readers can offer some personal experience on the subject.
DEAR SUN SPOTS: Edward Little Class of 1961 will be holding its 50th reunion on Aug. 6 at the Martindale Country Club from 4:30 p.m. to midnight with registration, social hour, entertainment, dinner and lots of time to chat.

Full text: BVote expected today on interim OR superintendentP
DURHAM - The Oyster River School Board is down to two final candidates for the interim superintendent position and is expected to vote this afternoon on a possible selection.
On Tuesday, board members held public interviews with Michelle Langa and Leon Levesque.
Langa was superintendent for SAU 61 in Farmington and Middleton from 2006 to 2010, and also an assistant superintendent for SAU 50 in Greenland, New Castle, Newington and Rye from 1999 to 2004. She has more than 30 years experience in education with many years focused working with special education.
"I have seen a broad spectrum of educational services," she said.
Levesque was the superintendent of the Lewiston School Department in Lewiston, Maine, from 1998 to 2010. Levesque was also a superintendent for Hallowell, Maine, from 1993 to 1998. He said he retired from that district last year to take a "needed break," and after six months said he is recharged and ready to go again as an interim superintendent.
Both were asked similar questions during separate sessions before the School Board. Business Administrator Sue Caswell, Director of Instruction Meredith Nadeau and interim High School Principal Todd Allen were also allowed to ask questions during the interview process as part of the search committee.
When asked the candidates' beliefs on what the role of an interim superintendent should be for the Oyster River School District, Langa quickly replied it would be to support the ongoing movement within the district related to goals and initiatives. She said an interim superintendent should be able to solidify the staff and continue the busy summer work of applying for grants, finishing any remaining reports and prepare for any need of new hires.
"It is not a time to sit back and relax," she said about the summer. "But I do see the interim superintendent would be there to support the community and your ongoing initiatives while nurturing the staff in its transition."
Levesque said an interim superintendent is a "transition person" and needs to make sure initiatives are still maintained, while building good relationships with staff and community members.
While Langa described herself as a facilitator, Levesque said he feels strongly about building leadership within the community.
"I think it's clear schools are about learning, they are for the kids," he said. "The focus is on youth and providing them the best opportunities."
Both candidates were asked how they would approach developing a budget. Langa said she has been trained in "zero-based budgeting" and would approach each line as if they were started fresh each year. She also said she would want to inform the community well in advance what the budget means for the students, staff and taxpayers so residents would know what they are voting on during elections.
"We need to be good stewards of the community's dollars," she said.
Levesque said for past budgets, he has found that presenting a working budget, or rough draft, to the school community often helps to establish guidelines and to see where adjustments should be made.
When School Board members asked how the candidates would each approach keeping district policies in check, Langa said she would suggest bringing policies before the board regularly to encourage everyone be up-to-date.
Levesque admitted that although keeping up with policy may not be the most exciting task, it is necessary and he would look at combing through policies with the board to make sure it was being followed.
When talk turned to promoting community communications, Levesque said he believed each school has the capacity to reach its community members using letters, the local press and an updated website.
Langa said she would be strong with decisions and helping the district and community communicate.
"I use technology to reach people that I can't reach face-to-face," she said, adding she is a frequent user of e-mails and newsletters.
She also said she knows how to write a blog and would use any technological tools available to communicate the message of the district with the community.
When it came time for candidates to ask questions of the board, Langa asked what type of person members were looking for in an interim superintendent.
Member Megan Turnbull said she would hope an interim superintendent would have strong communication skills and be able to work with the board, staff and the community.
Allen said he wanted someone who is visible in the schools, while Board Chair Henry Brackett suggested someone who can motivate the staff.
Levesque asked committee members what they saw as critical initiatives. His response from Brackett indicated he was looking for someone to help move the district forward.
Following the public interviews, board members deliberated on the candidates. However, Brackett said they would have to hold off the vote until today when members could post a meeting in which they could vote.
Former Middle School teacher and Durham resident John Parsons said although he wasn't ready to say which candidate he felt more strongly about, he was glad the School Board held the open session and asked a variety of questions.
"The obvious question is how the new interim superintendent is going to help members of the board work together," he said.
With recent talk surrounding the superintendent's departure, the high school principal's resignation and the process to replace her, Parsons said he hopes the selected interim superintendent will help the public and the board move the community forward.
Durham resident Seth Fiermonti said he was glad the interviews were open to the public and was pleased he was able to hear what the two finalists had to say.
School Board members are expected to meet today at 2 p.m. at the high school in room C-124 to vote on selecting a possible interim superintendent.

Full text: Some of the most beautiful and wild coastland in Maine will be featured Friday night on Discovery Channel's survival show "Dual Survival."
The show, which focuses on how well two survival experts manage in challenging situations, was shot early this spring at Cutler Coast Public Reserved Land unit and Quoddy Head State Park.
Called "Road to Nowhere," the episode will air at 9 p.m., featuring survival experts Cody Lundin and Dave Canterbury in a not-so-uncommon Maine scenario. The challenge, according to the program's official website: "In the isolated woods of northern Maine, Cody and Dave take on the role of two travelers, lost and out of gas on an abandoned logging road. Their only resource is a broken down truck, which they pillage for all its worth including a can of dog food."
Cutler Coast, known as the "Bold Coast," is a 12,234-acre region consisting of blueberry barrens, woodland and peat lands, with 4.5 miles of headlands interspersed by pocket coves and cobble beaches overlooking the Bay of Fundy. There are 10 miles of trails, three remote tent sites and incredible views from steep cliffs.
Quoddy Head State Park, located near Lubec, encompasses 541 acres at the tip of the easternmost peninsula in the U.S. It features iconic West Quoddy Head lighthouse and 5 miles of scenic trails overlooking Quoddy Channel, which divides the U.S. and Canada.
Friday night's program is the season closer. The episode was filmed during one week this past April. Among the activities for the episode listed by the company were: construct a shelter using natural resources; collect firewood and build a campfire; and hunt for edibles, including shellfish and small game.
This is the second time this year that production companies have chosen Maine state parks, historic sites and public-reserved lands for shooting television episodes. Earlier this year, SyFy Channel shot an episode of "Ghost Hunters" at Fort Knox State Historic Site in Prospect. An episode of PBS's "History Detectives" also was shot at Fort McClary State Historic Site and will air later in July.

Full text: FARMINGTON -- When Nancy Prentiss tells people about her studies, they tend to squirm.
Called "the worm lady" by some students, Prentiss studies and identifies marine worms that live in the shallow waters off St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands since 2007.
The tiny organisms, some smaller than an eyelash, play a significant role in the marine ecosystem, she said Thursday.
"They can be quite extraordinarily beautiful, very ornate and colorful," she said.
Prentiss, a longtime faculty member at the University of Maine at Farmington, received a $33,000 National Science Foundation grant last summer to help develop a database of the polychaete, or worm.
The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research grant has helped purchase collection equipment, including microscopes, and provided for travel expenses, she said.
Her work has drawn attention from other polychaete experts and researchers from Greece, Australia and Mexico.
She has developed a marine biology course at UMF and takes about 16 students to the Caribbean each May to study the tropical island ecology.
A sabbatical from UMF in 2009 provided the time for her to indulge in her research and really "gave it a springboard to take off," she said.
Her interest began in the early 1980s. After receiving a degree in botany from the University of Maine at Orono, she wanted to pursue a graduate degree in marine biology. A professor had a medical research grant to study marine worms found on the coast of Maine.
She thought she would work with "more glamorous" sea life such as turtles or colorful fish, but the work paid for most of her master's degree and in the process she learned to identify marine worms found in every ocean throughout the world, she said.
Prentiss began to look at marine worms in the Caribbean while working in a marine lab in St. Croix. There was a lot of research being done on coral reefs and turtles but not much focus on worms.
Many fish depend on these worms and they can make organic material available to larger fish, she said. Some worms disappear in polluted waters while others thrive.
The worms are not always beneficial. Some worms can wreak havoc on the shellfish industry. Other worms can carpet the ocean floor. They're beautiful but damaging, she said. New Zealand spent several million dollars trying to eradicate a non-native worm from its seabeds in harbors, she said.
There are tens of thousands of species in seas across the globe. Many have not been identified and their importance to the marine ecosystem is not recognized.
"When I look at something I refer to it as either a treasure chest or opening a Pandora's box," she said of the sediment, dead coral, old algae and seaweed that she studies, some of it handled with an eye dropper because it's so fragile.
"I never cease to be amazed at the little worms that come crawling out. Ones that no one has ever seen or looked at before," she said.
The worms also play a role as an indicator of environmental stress.
"Polychaetes are like the proverbial canary in a coal mine when it comes to understanding what's happening in a marine environment," she said in a release. "My research gathers the kind of data that can shed light on the interconnections between marine worms and other marine organisms and help scientists understand the health status of a marine ecosystem."

Abstract: * Rep. Stephen Wood, R-Sabattus, wants to amend the state's bear hunting and trapping laws. Wood's LD 468 would push back by one week the open season for bear hunting with dogs; prohibit trapping on another person's land without written permission; prohibit dog training on bears seven days before the start of the hunting period; and increase the bag limit to two bears by allowing a hunter to kill one bear by trapping and one by shooting. * [Jeffrey Timberlake], who lists his occupation as a farmer, wants to exempt family farms from Maine's estate tax. LD 490 is scheduled for a Monday public hearing. * Rep. Jarrod Crockett, R-Bethel, has a bill that would allow male citizens and immigrants to register with the military's Selective Service System when applying for a driver's license.

Full text: Here is a list of highlights from bills 426 through 525 sponsored by tri-county lawmakers.
* Rep. Michael Carey, D-Lewiston, has a bill that would raise the state's minimum wage to match inflation, or the consumer price index. The proposal is opposed by several trade groups and the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, all of which argue that the economy is too fragile to withstand a wage increase. Carey said he submitted the bill because the minimum wage should increase along with the cost of essential goods.
The Legislature's Labor Committee heard LD 457 last week. A committee vote on the bill has not been scheduled.
* Rep. Stephen Wood, R-Sabattus, wants to amend the state's bear hunting and trapping laws. Wood's LD 468 would push back by one week the open season for bear hunting with dogs; prohibit trapping on another person's land without written permission; prohibit dog training on bears seven days before the start of the hunting period; and increase the bag limit to two bears by allowing a hunter to kill one bear by trapping and one by shooting.
No public hearing has been scheduled.
* Rep. Jeffrey Timberlake, R-Turner, has a bill that would require the Department of Transportation to place directional signs to Hebron Academy on the closest southbound and northbound exits of Interstate 95. Hebron Academy would pay for the signs.
The transportation committee voted to pass LD 483 on March 11. It will now go for a vote in the House of Representatives.
* Timberlake also has a bill that would allow hay bales and corn stalks to be burned in outdoor wood boilers. The natural resources committee voted not to pass LD 484, but the vote produced a divided report, which means the bill still has a chance in the House.
* Rep. Lance Harvell, R-Farmington, wants to exempt active duty military servicemen from paying state income tax. The fiscal impact of the bill has not been determined.
LD 489 has already had a public hearing. The taxation committee will vote on the proposal on Tuesday.
* Timberlake, who lists his occupation as a farmer, wants to exempt family farms from Maine's estate tax. LD 490 is scheduled for a Monday public hearing.
* Rep. Jarrod Crockett, R-Bethel, has a bill that would allow male citizens and immigrants to register with the military's Selective Service System when applying for a driver's license.
LD 501 is scheduled for a March 31 public hearing.
* Rep. Matthew Peterson, D-Rumford, has a bill that would repeal provisions authorizing the commissioner of the Department of Education to require school districts to report student Social Security numbers.
No public hearing has been scheduled for LD 506.
* Sen. Lois Snowe-Mello, R-Poland, is sponsoring a bill that would exempt shellfish processing facilities from testing and reporting requirements and discharge limits concerning arsenic.
The bill is slated for public hearing Wednesday.
* Snowe-Mello also wants the state to study the law that revokes a driver's license for individuals who don't pay child support. The study commission would report back later this year.
LD 511 is scheduled for a March 31 public hearing.
* Sen. Thomas Saviello, R-Wilton, is sponsoring a resolution to amend the Maine Constitution to change the current amortization schedule of unfunded liabilities in the Maine Public Employees Retirement System from a fixed 31-year schedule to a so-called open, or rolling, 25-year schedule.
A public hearing hasn't been scheduled for LD 513.

Full text: At first it didn't make any sense.
Random Tuesday. 1 o'clock in the afternoon. And the place was hopping.
Like, desperately-scour-the-lot-for-a-parking-space hopping.
Then we got inside and spied the ready-to-eat sushi, trail mix, antipasto, gelato, barbecue and salad bars, the full bakery -- no, really, a stuffed full bakery -- and the artfully arranged produce section and thought, oh, that's why.
Welcome to Whole Foods.
It was Bag Lady's first time. Shopping Siren goes as often as she can, which is not often enough.
We're not sure we could grocery shop-grocery shop here -- think price, distance and the overwhelming desire to toss absolutely everything we encountered into our cart -- but we had a blast walking the aisles and admiring the selection of organic foods, mouthwatering treats and specialty merchandise. We imagine it's a fun place to splurge for a dinner party. Or, with its walk-up, made-to-order food counters and a section of tables out front, a trendy place to meet friends for lunch. Or a great place to blow a paycheck, should one ever need to.
Because, believe us, you could blow a paycheck here.
* Bulk pack chicken breast, $6.09/pound
On the label: Eco-friendly, never frozen and, the most curious selling point, "air chilled." Must be the penguins waving palm fronds over blocks of ice that account for the price. Penguins don't wave cheap.
* Mini chocolate cheesecake for one, $1.99
Offered a taste of their full-on bakery with so much drizzle, glitz and variety that it was like an actual stand-alone bakery was really just being held hostage inside a Whole Foods. Um. In a hostage-friendly way.
* Cupcakes, 6-pack, $5.99
The chocolate cake with white icing cupcakes have long been a Shopping Siren favorite, but she's willing to branch out and try the yellow cake with chocolate frosting or the chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. If only there were more hours in the day (and more pants sizes in the stores). Wait, there are more pants sizes. Great news! Bring on the cakes.
* Large, fresh fruit bowl, $34.99
A giant bowl chock-full of grapes, strawberries, blueberries and pineapple. Sticker on the front touts "Extreme value!" We question whether a $35 fruit bowl constitutes a value, extreme or otherwise, but it did look delicious and contained fruit that we'd actually eat. Hey! Maybe that's the secret to getting adults to eat more fruit: Put it in an expensive fruit bowl. And maybe add whipped cream.
* Coconut pieces, $6.99/lb.
We're not sure what we'd do with pieces of coconut except maybe re-enact some scenes from "Survivor," but here they are! In Maine! In January! We are easily impressed by food.
* Fresh almond butter and fresh peanut butter, $6.99/lb and $2.69/lb.
How fresh? So fresh it has to be refrigerated. For some, that's a plus. For others, a reason to run for the Skippy or Jiff.
* Chico Bag, $15.99
A three-pack of these produce bags stuff into an apple-shaped, apple-sized fourth bag for the most adorable produce-related find ever. The bags are all made from plastic bottles, so an eco-friendly baby seal spontaneously appears with every purchase.
* Blackbird Studios handmade felted soap, 5 oz., $10.99
Scented soap the size of a modest stone, entirely wrapped in a felt sheath, handcrafted in Gray. Use like a hippie loofah. (Huh. First time we've ever written that directive.)
* Spicy stir-fry mix, $2.99/lb.
Chopped mushrooms, onions and peppers sprinkled with paprika, so all you have to do is heat, toss, eat. We can do that.
* Wellshire chicken-apple sausage patties, 5-pack, $4.99
Chicken and apple sausage. We don't make this stuff up.
* Rosemary mint lamb rib chops, $14.99/pound
So "Top Chef" we could almost hear Padma telling us to pack our knives and go.
* Soup and chowder station, $4.99/12 oz.
Choices on this day included clam chowder and smoked salmon chowder, both of which smelled wonderful. Add a little pack of oyster crackers for 15 cents and you've got yourself a meal.
* Life Factory Glass, 16 oz., $19.99
A glass travel bottle with silicone sleeve that had us fawning -- so cute! so heavy! We're hoping the silicone sleeve means it bounces rather than shatters when dropped. We weren't brave enough to try in the store.
* Banana Mish Mash organic fruit snack for tots, 3.17 oz., $1.49
Mmm. Banana mash.
* Simply Divine Brownie, 1.34/pound, $10.99
Pick from caramel pecan, chocolate frosted or peanut butter. We know. It's like choosing your favorite child.
* Little Lad's herbal popcorn, 13 oz., $5.99
Remember Little Lad's used to be right in downtown Lewiston? Still jonesing for its popcorn? This is for you, our friend.
Best find: Football cake, 1.88 pounds, $4.99
No football-related party would be complete without this adorable, football-shaped, half-a-football-sized cake dressed in chocolate icing and white icing laces, set atop green frosting grass. This alone may be worth the drive to Portland.
Think twice: Mestemacher Fitness Bread, 17.6 oz., $4.09
Dense as a brick and just as appetizing. However, it does have at least one benefit: A long shelf life. Good until 11/11/2011, that leaves approximately 10 months to not eat this.
* Prices as of 1/11

Full text: LEWISTON -- When cans of beer from Baxter Brewing hit shelves in January, they'll join a crowded field.
More than a dozen Maine breweries offer bottled beer. Some, such as Shipyard, are available nationwide. Others bottle by hand in small batches. No one else is canning.
If there's one thing they have in common, it's that business is very good.
"We're trending at about 10 to 12 percent over 2009," said David Geary, founder of Geary's, New England's oldest brewery. In 2009, his brewery produced about 20,000 barrels and distributed beer to 14 states.
Luke Livingston, president of Baxter Brewing, projects that he'll sell about 5,000 barrels of his ales in 2011. That's equal to more than 1.6 million cans, and enough to make him Maine's fourth-biggest brewer by 2009 figures.
His system allows him to brew 30 barrels at a time before moving the beer to one of several fermenting and conditioning tanks. Livingston acknowledges it's a big system for a new brewery.
"It was sort of a 'go big or go home' mentality," he said of the decision to start a large brewery. He plans to meet with Massachusetts distributors next week and start selling there by summer.
It's ambitious but not unrealistic. According to the Brewers Association, an advocacy group for craft brewers, craft beer grew 9 percent by volume and 12 percent in dollars over last year in the first half of 2010. That's in spite of a 2.7 percent drop on overall beer sales.
Craft brewers, defined by the Brewers Association as small, independent and traditional, have been posting huge gains for years.
Demand insatiable
Scott Oliver, craft beer manager for Pine State Beverage, said the market for high-end beer is "insatiable."
Oliver's position is a new one, added at the beginning of November so the company could respond to the growing craft beer market. He's educating consumers and other Pine State employees on beer history and pairings of different styles with food.
Oliver said he's seen strong interest in Baxter beers in stores and restaurants around the state. He estimated that in the 14 counties where Pine State sells beer, all but York and Cumberland, about 10 percent of beer sales go to craft brands.
When Geary's brewery opened 24 years ago, the idea of a local brewery was new to Mainers.
"There was a lot of explaining to people exactly what it was we were doing," Geary recalled. "They'd scratch their heads and say, 'What, you make it in your bathtub?'"
Still, he found early support from retail chains and Portland bars such as Three Dollar Dewey's and the Great Lost Bear.
Ed Stebbins, who co-founded Gritty McDuff's, likes to tell a story about when the pub first opened in 1988 and he tended bar on Saturday nights.
"I was really proud to serve the beers I brewed," Stebbins said. One night, a man came in and asked him for a Budweiser.
"I said, 'I'm sorry, sir, we only serve the beers we brew here,'" he said. "The guy, without missing a beat, looked me in the eye and said, 'OK, son, brew me a Budweiser.' That's the way it was."
In the late 1980s, Stebbins said, no one in the U.S. was selling brewing systems for small breweries.
That's where Alan Pugsley came in.
Craft beer's Johnny Appleseed
Pugsley, born in England, had worked under a brewer named Peter Austin at the Ringwood Brewery. Austin's Hampshire, England brewery was popular in the Real Ale movement, a push by English publicans for a return to old-fashioned, cask-conditioned beers.
Austin began using his skill as a brewer to help others build their own breweries, and hired Pugsley to help him. It was during that time that Pugsley met David Geary.
Geary was a connoisseur of the English and Scottish beers served at Three Dollar Dewey's in Portland. He became friends with Peter Maxwell Stuart, a Scotsman who traveled to America to promote his beer, Traquair House.
Stuart invited Geary to learn brewing and brewery operation in Scotland. Geary took him up on it, and while traveling in Scotland and England, he met Pugsley at Ringwood.
Geary hired Pugsley to help him set up a brewery in Portland. Pugsley helped him order a 25-barrel brewery from England and have it shipped over. He helped Geary create Geary's Pale Ale using the Ringwood yeast from Austin's brewery, a distinctive and fast-acting strain that would come to characterize New England beer.
After Geary's opened, Pugsley started his own company, Pugsley Brewing Systems International. His influence on beer in the Northeast earned him the nickname "the Johnny Appleseed of brewing."
Maine's first brew pub
In 1988, he set up Gritty's brew pub in Portland. It was Maine's first brew pub since Prohibition. During the pub's construction, Stebbins said he honed his brewing skill working at Geary's.
Stebbins and his business partner, Richard Pfeffer, called Pugsley back to Maine in 1991 when they were considering opening a new brew pub in Kennebunkport. They brought their friend, Fred Forsley, a real estate investor who had started Fred Forsley Realty at 19 years old.
Forsley and Pugsley became partners in a business that what would become the Shipyard Brewery.
"After we opened up the brewery in Portland, it started to take off on draft and we couldn't produce enough of it in Kennebunk," Forsley said. "In '96, we were the fastest-growing micro in the country."
Enter Miller Brewing
But growth is expensive for breweries, and Forsley needed a way to fund it. "We looked at a lot of options. We looked at raising money with partners, we looked at going public, we looked at partnering with other liquor companies, beer companies."
In 1995, Forsley decided to sell half of the company to Miller Brewing to help pay expansion costs.
"At the time, the philosophy at Miller was to let the micros do what the micros do. They didn't try to take them over," he said.
Shipyard bought Miller's share back in 2000.
In 2009, Shipyard brewed about 82,000 barrels, including contract brewing for Gritty's and other breweries. Pugsley expects to end 2010 with 95,000 to 97,000 barrels brewed. A brewery expansion is planned in the spring.
However, Sea Dog, another brew pub Pugsley helped launch, went bankrupt after it began bottling. Shipyard bought the brand and today, Sea Dog's blueberry-flavored Bluepaw is one of Shipyard's best sellers.
Baxter learns from past
At Baxter, in Lewiston, Livingston said he learned the lesson of breweries that couldn't keep up with expansion.
He's done a lot of research into the growth of canned craft beer and believes he'll need his large brewing system once summer beer sales pick up and his beer hits the Massachusetts market, Livingston said.
Right now, he has two 60-barrel fermenters and two 120-barrel conditioning tanks, where beer goes after fermentation and before canning to smooth out its flavors.
The brewery has space for four more fermenters and another conditioning tank.
"We've designed it so we can scale up quickly, if necessary," Livingston said.
Boutique beer growing too
Not all Maine breweries are made to be giants. Boutique breweries such as the Maine Beer Company and Marshall Wharf have been popping up for the past few years, filling niches in the Maine beer market.
Maine Beer co-founder David Kleban said he didn't know whether his hoppy Peeper Ale, which runs about $5 for a 16 oz. bottle, would find a market. He and his brother Daniel started in July 2009 in a garage with a one-barrel system he calls "a glorified home brew set-up."
Kleban took coolers of his beer to restaurants and supermarkets he thought could sell a somewhat pricey beer. Peeper Ale was soon in Whole Foods, Downeast Beverage and Novare Res Bier Cafe in Portland. The beer sold out and soon he was getting orders he couldn't fill.
"Last summer was pretty painful because we basically just told a bunch of people no," Kleban said. "They'd ordered a ton of cases and we'd give them maybe one."
He and his brother have upgraded to a 15-barrel system and will be selling beer in Vermont and Massachusetts this year. He said his goal was to reach about 3,000 barrels a year and stay there.
His beers, both Peeper and Zoe, have received rave reviews. With dozens of user reviews on the website Beer Advocate, Peeper and Zoe are ranked the seventh best beer in the American Pale Ale and American Amber Ale categories, respectively. That puts them above hundreds of beers of the same style.
In Belfast, the Marshall Wharf brewery brews what many call "extreme beer." They brew beers at more than 11 percent alcohol, using nontraditional ingredients such as blue agave and oysters. So far, they've only been available at the 3Tides restaurant in Belfast and on tap at a few restaurants in Portland and Belfast.
"We're such a small scale," owner David Carlson said. "We're a seven-barrel system and that really limits us as far as going out and putting things on the shelf. But one of the things my two brewers and I really enjoy is just the wide variety of beers that we brew."
At 3Tides, Marshall Wharf offers 17 beers on tap.
Carlson said the brewery soon will release a limited line of bottled beers that have been aged for two years in Heaven Hill whiskey barrels. Two-year aged beers are almost unheard of. Carlson said he expects to ask $15 to $20 for his 22-ounce bottles.
Baxter price: $8 to $10 a 6-pack
Far from the niche market prices of Marshall Wharf, Livingston said his beer will be priced comparatively with Shipyard, Geary's and Sebago, which typically run between $8 and $10 for a six-pack.
Maine's first brewer said that while competition between Maine breweries can be "fierce," he wishes Livingston well.
"I think it's pretty innovative to go with cans," Geary said. He said Baxter's best asset is its brew master, Mike LaCharite, whom Geary called "a really talented guy."
Among Maine's large-scale brewers, Livingston will be the first to offer West Coast-style, American ales. Shipyard, Geary's and others offer subtle, English-style ales, with their elegant balance of sweet and bitter. Allagash in Portland makes strong, experimental Belgian-style ales.
"In terms of what's going on in the middle with American-style stuff, there's not a whole lot commercially available. That's the niche ..." Livingston said, stopping to correct himself. "That's the void we're hoping to fill."

Abstract: Eleven oil rig workers died in the April 10 Deepwater Horizon blowout.

Full text: The disastrous explosion at BP's Deepwater Horizon off-shore oil rig last month serves as a reminder that private enterprise can never be permitted to function free from effective regulatory scrutiny. The more hazardous the activity, the closer that scrutiny should be.
Eleven oil rig workers died in the April 10 Deepwater Horizon blowout. Since then, 200,000 gallons of oil a day, according to BP, or as much as 3 to 4 million gallons daily, according to an independent estimate, have gushed into the Gulf of Mexico, threatening beaches, wetlands, sea life and birds. About 45,000 square miles of fisheries have been declared off limits in a region that yields 3/4 of this country's shrimp, 2/3 of its oysters and 30% of its crabs.
The long oil plume, which has entered the Gulf "loop current," could round the Florida Keys and start up the East Coast, imperiling fishing and tourism there.
It's been an alarming wake-up call to the dangers of off-shore drilling, the technology of which had been touted by the petroleum industry for its safety and reliability. The industry's safety claims have been reminiscent of the smug assurances routinely issued by the nuclear power industry prior to Three Mile Island reactor meltdown on May 28, 1979.
While it's too soon to know for sure, there are early indications that BP exerted pressure on Transocean, its contractor, to expedite drilling in order to save money, causing Transocean to proceed with work despite evidence of serious malfunctions in the rig's backup safety systems.
BP is the same company whose Texas City, Texas refinery explosion killed 15 workers in March 2005, and which was subsequently cited by OSHA for 862 alleged violations between June 2007 and February 2010, most of them classified as "egregious" and "willful."
BP has not been alone in its apparent reckless behavior. Its record is matched by those of other energy giants, such as Massey Energy Company, the nation's fourth-largest coal mining enterprise. A mine explosion at a Massey mine in West Virginia on April 5 claimed the lives of 29 miners. The mine had been cited for more than 1,100 safety violations during the prior three years.
Nor does it help that the fox has been guarding the chicken coop. There has been a longstanding cozy relationship between the U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, the regulatory agency responsible for granting off-shore drilling and other mineral rights to the oil and coal industries. Current Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, former Colorado attorney general and U.S. Senator, has also been a strong energy-industry advocate throughout his career.
Of course, most business activities carry elements of risk, sometimes extreme risk, which is precisely why regulation is necessary -- to protect the public interest. Effective regulation, however, is often undermined by public complacency, political pressures, business' natural inclination to short change safety to cut costs, and the incestuous relationship which tends to develop between regulators and the regulated.
The "invisible hand" of free-market capitalism - Adam Smith's famous phrase for describing the self-regulating nature of the law of supply and demand - is the most efficient economic system ever invented for creating wealth. But anti-government zealots, who carp about bureaucratic intrusion into the private realm, would do well to remember that on-the-books profits are often generated by foisting off-the-book expenses onto the general public.
Such expenses can include worker injuries, environmental spoliation, public health hazards, economic chaos, and financial losses due to fraud and unfair trade practices. Individuals, or society as a whole, typically end up bearing part or all of these burdens. Hence the need for rules and enforcement to minimize the external costs generated by business.
Although BP will be held accountable for the financial losses from the Deepwater Horizon accident, lives have been lost, occupations ruined and the environment compromised. Even if all related costs can be tallied and BP picks up the tab, money can't necessarily fix all the harm done.
From the Middle Ages through the 1700s, government regulation of the commercial world was taken for granted. For instance, maximum prices were set on many staples. Merchants were subject to punishment for failing to use true weights and measures in the marketplace. Apprenticeships were required for entry into certain trades.
In the 1800s, however, especially in the United States, businessmen were given virtually free rein under the principle of "laissez faire," the philosophy that government has no place interfering in the economy.
Not until the early 1900s, under several progressive state governors and the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, were concerted attempts made to limit business monopolies, restrict discriminatory railroad rates, compensate injured workers, preserve natural resources, make rental housing safe, and prevent the sale of contaminated food and drugs.
Regulation of other aspects of economic life, including the stock markets, banking and labor conditions grew substantially during the New Deal in the 1930s, World War II and the post-war period.
But in the 1980s, under the influence of President Ronald Reagan and conservative Republicans, regulation of business acquired a bad reputation, and controls were significantly eased in fields such as passenger air travel, radio and television broadcasting and banking.
Indeed, the pendulum has swung so far back in the direction of governmental abstention that the public is now paying the price.
A recalibration of the balance between private enterprise's need to remain flexible and profitable and the public's right to be protected from reasonably avoidable risks to health, safety and stability is overdue.
It's time to recognize that the business of America is not always the same as America's business.

Students, parents go all out for pizza day

Abstract: "We have no school today. Can we go eat Mr. [Tom]'s pizza?" Erika and Cheyenne asked their mom. "We miss his pizza. It's so good," said 11-year-old Erika in between hugs from her former classmates. "Fridays I'm always here" said Vince Hess as he shuffled pizzas in and out of the oven. "Four years of doing this, and I have only dropped one pizza ... and never burnt any," said Hess, who swings in on his lunch break to help out in the kitchen. Nearly 100 percent of the kids choose hot lunch on pizza day. "That is a day that I don't have to make lunches," said a smiling [Jenn Marcotte], who has five children in the school. "My kids love (pizza day). My mom asks me to bring home pizza," she said. If Marcotte's husband can't stop in to eat lunch with the kids on Fridays, he requests that pizza be brought home as well, she said.

Full text: LEWISTON -- Not feeling so well, a student decided he would stay home from school one day. Then he realized it was Friday. It was "pizza day."
He made it to school.
"Pizza day here rocks," said Jay Levesque, principal at the Vineyard Christian School, a private Lewiston campus with 126 students. Every Friday, a kitchen full of volunteers add toppings to between 40 and 50 pizzas and bake them for lunch.
In between bites, students, teachers and visitors all give credit to one particular chef.
"This is Tom. He makes the best pizza on the planet," said Jenna Stepp, the mother of 6-year-old kindergartner Marie Stepp. Jenna visits her daughter for lunch every Friday.
"Everybody looks forward to Tom's pizza," said gym teacher Angela Gagne, the mother of Austin, a 5 year old in the prekindergarten class.
Thomas Harris, 62, of Durham retired from heavy construction work and has volunteered in the kitchen ever since. "I have been surrounded by cooking all my life," said the father of five sons. "I have been in the kitchen since I was 8 years old."
While fresh ingredients and a variety of toppings are what makes Harris' pizzas taste so good, the kitchen help is what stands out the most for Harris.
"It's not just about the pizza; it's about the environment," Harris said. His volunteer staff comprises parents, students and school alumni who keep coming back.
"What I love most is when the kids get involved," said educational technician Jenn Marcotte. "Friday's are kind of a community day."
Kari-Ann Hannigan's two daughters are former students of Vineyard. They now attend Sabattus Central School and had the day off from school last Friday.
"We have no school today. Can we go eat Mr. Tom's pizza?" Erika and Cheyenne asked their mom. "We miss his pizza. It's so good," said 11-year-old Erika in between hugs from her former classmates.
"They are so happy to be here," Kari-Ann said.
"Fridays I'm always here" said Vince Hess as he shuffled pizzas in and out of the oven. "Four years of doing this, and I have only dropped one pizza ... and never burnt any," said Hess, who swings in on his lunch break to help out in the kitchen.
"Tom's pizzas are kind of famous," Hess said. Mac and cheese pizza, smoked oysters and garlic pizza, and cream cheese and jalapeno pizza are just a few of the pies made by Harris.
"Tom is very creative, so you don't know what he is going to make," Stepp said.
"We try to let kids design their own pizzas," Harris said. "We go through a lot of garlic here. Kids like everything."
One senior created a pizza made with M&M's.
"We will try anything once," said Adam Carlson, a 2007 graduate who comes back every Friday to help.
Nearly 100 percent of the kids choose hot lunch on pizza day. "That is a day that I don't have to make lunches," said a smiling Marcotte, who has five children in the school. "My kids love (pizza day). My mom asks me to bring home pizza," she said. If Marcotte's husband can't stop in to eat lunch with the kids on Fridays, he requests that pizza be brought home as well, she said.
People say it's Harris' attitude that makes him such a success at tossing pizzas.
"Tom's energy level is amazing," Hess said. "A lot of the kids call him grandpa."
"Cooking is fun. Pizza is fun. I try to teach the kids that," he said. "Grandmothers used to teach everyone how to cook. We don't have that anymore."

Abstract: The legislation, supported by U.S. Reps. Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree, both Democrats, would call for a national strategy and regional action plans to reduce the size and occurrence of red tides, according to a release from Michaud's office. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced it intends to support an international proposal that would place the fish on the list, despite the fact that the U.S. bluefin catch has declined from 2000 to 2008 because of stricter management provisions, according to [Olympia Snowe]'s office.

Full text: Something fishy
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure on Friday that aims to minimize red tide, a harmful algae bloom that caused 97 percent of Maine's shellfish beds to close last summer.
The legislation, supported by U.S. Reps. Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree, both Democrats, would call for a national strategy and regional action plans to reduce the size and occurrence of red tides, according to a release from Michaud's office.
The Maine shellfish industry supports about 3,000 harvesters and dealers and brings about $50 million a year to coastal communities, according to a statement from Pingree's office.
There were also significant red tide outbreaks in 2005 and 2008.
In other fishing news this week, Sen. Olympia Snowe spoke with U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and reiterated her opposition to listing bluefin tuna as an endangered species.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced it intends to support an international proposal that would place the fish on the list, despite the fact that the U.S. bluefin catch has declined from 2000 to 2008 because of stricter management provisions, according to Snowe's office.
"Supporting policies that will further disadvantage our industry sends a terrible message to fishermen and to the rest of the world that doing the right thing and imposing strict domestic harvest reductions will only beget greater penalties," Snowe said in a statement.
On the ballot
Candidates seeking to be on primary ballots have until 5 p.m. Monday to turn in a sufficient number of signatures to the Maine Secretary of State's Office.
Several candidates for governor, including Democrat Rosa Scarcelli and Republicans Steve Abbott, Paul LePage, Peter Mills and Les Otten have turned in their papers.
Jason Levesque, an Auburn businessman running as a Republican to unseat U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, also met the signature threshold and submitted his paperwork to the Secretary of State.

1923 - 2009
SOUTH PARIS -- Kimball Hanley Dunton, 86, died on Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 26, at Market Square Health Care Center.
He was born in Rumford, June 22, 1923, the son of Charles Olney and Gladys Hanley Dunton. Kim attended Rumford schools, graduating from Stephens High, Class of 1942.
After graduation, he was employed by the Oxford Paper Co. until his marriage to Elaine M. Davis in 1944, at which time they settled in Plymouth, N.H. It was here that he started his first venture into business as a salesman.
Eventually, he moved to Boston, where he was employed until he established his own consulting business in New York City. His final challenge was to restore the foreclosed MPAC firm, moving it to Greene. It was here that he had a near fatal fall which led to his death.
He was a most compassionate and generous person, especially to his employees, many of whom became lifetime friends. He was happiest when he could make others happy, or when he was in one of his two favorite places, Oyster Bay, N.Y., or the Dunton camp at Howard Pond in Hanover.
He is survived by his nephew, William "Bill" Dunton; a sister-in-law, Dorothy M. Dunton; a grandnephew, Richard Dunton and wife, Tricia; a grandniece, Jill Bartash and husband, John J. Bartash, all of Maine.
He was predeceased by his parents; his wife Elaine; his sister, Virginia Hutchins and her husband, Charles; his brother, Dr. William H. Dunton; his aunt, Mary Northgraves; and several cousins. He will be fondly remembered by his special friend, Mary Buzzard of Sedona, Ariz. His family; Madeleine Petrara and children, Theodore, Madeleine, Angela and Salvatore as well as 10 grandchildren will be having a memorial service at Oyster Bay, N.Y. The Dunton family wishes to extend its heartfelt gratitude to the staff at Market Square Health Care Center for the patience and care extended to Kimball for several years.

Abstract: "Spineless Wonders: Invertebrates as Inspiration" celebrates the diversity of species for the 2009 bicentennial of Charles Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of "On the Origin of Species." Invertebrates make up a vast group that includes worms, insects and their larvae, spiders, jellyfish, shellfish such as crabs and shrimp, squid and more. An estimated 97 percent of all animal species are invertebrates. Paintings, prints, sculpture, poetry, video and work in clay, metal, fiber, glass, wood and stone by 56 artists from around the country are all part of this multidimensional exploration of the invertebrate world. An entomologist who has worked as a bug wrangler on dozens of Hollywood movies, including "Spider Man" and "G-Force," [Steven Kutcher] came up with the method while working on a piece in the 1980s for Steven Spielberg. The director tasked Kutcher with helping a fly leave footprints. "I know it really has a lot of potential," Kutcher said in a phone interview from his home in Arcadia, Calif. "I've kind of created a new language."

'Spineless Wonders'
Softball-sized dust mites. A "skeleton" of a praying mantis. Giant bronze flatworms. Fashionable handbags with squids. Artwork created with the help of a Madagascar hissing cockroach. These are all part of the 'Invertebrates as Inspiration' exhibit showing at the Atrium Gallery.
LEWISTON - When gallery director Robyn Holman issued her call for artworks - all pieces which draw inspiration from invertebrates - she worried they'd be uniform and pretty.
"I thought I would get a million dragonflies," Holman said.
Then pictures of paintings, sculptures and other media began arriving in her mail. They included a bronze image of a flatworm, hydras crafted from shredded tires, a praying mantis with a bicycle seat for a head and a compost exhibit, evolving on the spot by living, digesting earthworms.
Holman found herself enjoying a kind of riches.
"We tried to get as many kinds of expression as possible," said Holman, director of exhibitions at Lewiston-Auburn College's Atrium Art Gallery.
The title of the exhibit: "Spineless Wonders: Invertebrates as Inspiration."
The point of the show, which opened Sept. 8 and continues until Dec. 18, is to combine art and science. Holman figured that science folks might be interested in the insights of the artists. She also hoped artists would use the forms, figures or behaviors of invertebrates as a point of departure.
In many cases, the artists were already on their way.
Californian Steven Kutcher submitted a work that he created with the help of a Madagascar hissing cockroach. For a piece he named "Fly on the Wall," he painted the live roach's feet and belly with pigment and loosed it onto blank paper. As it crawled, he moved the page.
The result resembles a Jackson Pollock reinterpreted by a cockroach. He's done other works with beetles, bees, butterflies and moths.
"People always say a work gets more valuable when the artist dies," he said. "I have a box of dead artists to prove it."
An entomologist who has worked as a bug wrangler on dozens of Hollywood movies, including "Spider Man" and "G-Force," Kutcher came up with the method while working on a piece in the 1980s for Steven Spielberg. The director tasked Kutcher with helping a fly leave footprints.
He figured it out and recalled the secret while experimenting with paints a few years ago.
"I know it really has a lot of potential," Kutcher said in a phone interview from his home in Arcadia, Calif. "I've kind of created a new language."
The piece joins about 100 others, half from Maine.
Holman has also integrated the exhibit with Lewiston's Stanton Bird Club, which is planning a pair of events that would help people see invertebrates in nature.
The kind of interdisciplinary work is a Lewiston-Auburn College specialty. It spreads to Holman herself. Though the gallery director has an art background, Holman maintains bee hives outside her home in Auburn. "I'm very interested in science," she said.
Other eyes might find grotesqueness among the images in her gallery. Holman looked with wonder at each one, from the video of the cockroach being swallowed by a frog to the webcam atop the compost bin.
"There they are," she said, lifting the lid to the bin and peering and inside. "Eating away."

President's address likely to be just a lot of noise

Abstract: ABC News reports that Barack Obama has returned to Washington, only to step off the plane and "into his next domestic crisis." He "planned to leave the details of health care reform to Congress, but today the White House says he'll play a much stronger role." The Associated Press says Obama is "backing away" from his "'it's-all-on-the-table' approach" and is "prepared to get louder and more involved in the details of a health care overhaul." "This weekend," NBC Nightly News explained in its lead story, "the president signaled an aggressive stance to put his personal stamp on the sweeping legislation." Why the Obama administration is determined to do the time warp again is easier to decipher. Obama's advisors think the answer to every problem is more cowbell, if by "cowbell" you mean "Obama." It's like Obama guru David Axelrod is the Christopher Walken character from the "Saturday Night Live" skit about Blue Oyster Cult (if you don't know the reference, Google "cowbell").

Full text: ABC News reports that Barack Obama has returned to Washington, only to step off the plane and "into his next domestic crisis." He "planned to leave the details of health care reform to Congress, but today the White House says he'll play a much stronger role." The Associated Press says Obama is "backing away" from his "'it's-all-on-the-table' approach" and is "prepared to get louder and more involved in the details of a health care overhaul." "This weekend," NBC Nightly News explained in its lead story, "the president signaled an aggressive stance to put his personal stamp on the sweeping legislation."
There's only one problem. These stories were all reported nearly three months ago upon Obama's return from his largely failed European mission. And yet, The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Obama's planned address to a joint session of Congress this week "will insert the president into the heated debate in a way he has avoided all summer." The Washington Post informed readers that the "White House is scrambling to take control of the health-care debate after watching from the sidelines." A "senior aide" to Obama says the president will be "much more prescriptive."
Why the White House press corps didn't just change the date on their old copy and run it again is beyond me. And I'll leave it to others to ponder the media's seemingly infinite capacity to give Obama as many do-overs as he might need.
Why the Obama administration is determined to do the time warp again is easier to decipher. Obama's advisors think the answer to every problem is more cowbell, if by "cowbell" you mean "Obama." It's like Obama guru David Axelrod is the Christopher Walken character from the "Saturday Night Live" skit about Blue Oyster Cult (if you don't know the reference, Google "cowbell").
Every time someone comes up with an alternative to throwing Obama on TV, Axelrod says, "No, no, no. Guess what? I got a fever, and the only prescription ... is more Obama!"
But is that really what the doctor ordered?
Obama's address this week will be his third prime-time appeal in three months and the fifth in his 7-month-old presidency. The networks are chagrined about this, not least because the ratings half-life of these events is severe. (Fox's broadcast network beat out the other networks by running "So You Think You Can Dance" instead of his last prime-time press conference.) More relevant, they haven't done Obama much good.
His July 22 press conference was billed as perhaps Obama's last chance to save health care reform. It tanked (partly because Obama's attack on the Cambridge police dominated the press). Afterward, public support for ObamaCare dropped significantly. A Pew poll taken that week found that more people opposed the proposals being considered by Congress than supported them, and that Obama's overall approval had dropped 7 points from the previous month. Other polls showed similar declines.
Now, more than a month later, things look even worse. The obvious solution? Even more cowbell.
But what is lacking is not cowbell, it's substance the American people can support. Obama will reportedly be "more specific," but he won't commit himself to any particular piece of legislation. This suggests that the White House still thinks it has a communication problem, and if only it dispels the cloud of "lies" belched up by the opposition, there will be nothing but blue skies ahead.
Funny how the people who run the most sophisticated communication operation in the history of the presidency keep concluding that their difficulties stem from their inability to get their message out and never from what their message actually is.
And so, rather than change the substance of the message, they're grabbing an even bigger megaphone: an address to a joint session of Congress. Three out of the last four presidents gave just one address to a joint session of Congress, and all but one of them reserved such occasions for major international events, like a war or, in Ronald Reagan's case, a breakthrough with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Only Bill Clinton used such a venue for a domestic priority: health care reform.
That didn't work out so well either.
Just seven months into Obama's presidency, the White House is turning up the speakers on the cowbell as loud as they will go. And, heck, if you love cowbell, it's going to be a real treat. But in all the ways that matter, it may just end up being more noise.

Abstract: "I had never been to New Brunswick, had heard about it all my life, and had always wanted to go," Michot said before his band played a gig at the public library in Lewiston before a flight back to the Bayou from Bangor. "We had just a wonderful time." A native of Lafayette who had never retraced his roots, Michot spent six days mingling with distant cousins on New Brunswick's Acadian Peninsula, and entertained them with traditional music and his gift for gab. Before heading to Lewiston, which has one of the largest Franco-American communities in New England, [Les Freres Michot] played in Tracadie-Sheila, Caraquet and Pokemouche, the latter on Tuesday during the Congres Mondial Acadian's Louisiana Day celebration. "It was like, 'Welcome to Acadia, you Cajun,'" Michot said. "You've been gone."

Full text: A fiddle-playing judge from Louisiana who hunts alligators, Rick Michot blew into New Brunswick like a hurricane last week while attending the World Acadian Congress.
The front man of an acclaimed Cajun band called Les Freres Michot, he was on his way south on Thursday, having suffered only the pain of a nip on the lip from a crab, the cold water of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and an eel dinner in Evangeline, N.B.
"I had never been to New Brunswick, had heard about it all my life, and had always wanted to go," Michot said before his band played a gig at the public library in Lewiston before a flight back to the Bayou from Bangor. "We had just a wonderful time."
A native of Lafayette who had never retraced his roots, Michot spent six days mingling with distant cousins on New Brunswick's Acadian Peninsula, and entertained them with traditional music and his gift for gab. Before heading to Lewiston, which has one of the largest Franco-American communities in New England, Les Freres Michot played in Tracadie-Sheila, Caraquet and Pokemouche, the latter on Tuesday during the Congres Mondial Acadian's Louisiana Day celebration.
Along with toe-tappin' music, he had a crowd of several hundred people riveted with tales of gator hunting, which is great fun until you catch one.
Michot, a district court judge who lives at the edge of the swamp in Broussard, used beef pancreas as bait while bagging five gators last year in a limited hunt where participants are chosen by lottery.
"The challenge is to pull them to your boat without letting the rope get tangled in the motor, and then to get a clear shot at them with a .22 and do it without putting a bullet through the top of your foot and the bottom of the boat," he said.
Michot, his accordion-playing brother Tommy, and Rick's son, Patrick, gave a concert in Dieppe on Wednesday night before leaving for Maine early Thursday. They arrived in Lewiston just in time to take a picture of a "Michaud for Congress" sign, do a sound check, and have supper before playing for an hour and joining in a renovated ballroom on the third floor of the public library.
The group, which usually plays as a quintet, was joined by Jay Young, a bass-playing probate lawyer from Falmouth who has previously performed in Lafayette, and Cindy Larock, the library's cultural coordinator and budding triangle player.
Larock said the group's appearance in Lewiston was arranged at the last minute, but she was thrilled to host Les Freres Michot, nonetheless. The band has appeared at such prestigious venues as the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., the jazz and heritage festival in New Orleans and the Festival Internationale des Francophones in Limousin, France, and has also entertained at parties for President George W. Bush and Princess Anne and Princess Margaret of England.
"This was too good to pass up,'' Larock said.
The Louisianans agreed to play in Lewiston in exchange for dinner, a hotel room, a ride to the airport, an opportunity to sell their most recent CD, and receipts from whomever they brought though the door.
"They're pretty much playing for a six-pack and lobster rolls," Larock said.
The library cultural coordinator turned triangle player made New England fish chowder, potato salad and Maine blueberry cake for the occasion.
"We really wanted to show them some serious northern hospitality," she said.
New Brunswickers likewise rolled out the red carpet for the first fiddle-playing, gator-wrestling judge they have ever seen.
Michot said that he told locals on the Acadian Peninsula that he enjoys open-water swimming, and suddenly found himself swimming in the Gulf of St. Lawrence accompanied by two kayakers and a fellow swimmer who wanted to make sure he was safe.
He was safe, and also freezing.
"They told me not to bring my wet suit,'' he said. "Later I found out the water was 62 degrees.
"I was cold, but I didn't give them the satisfaction of knowing it."
By the end of his stay, he was swimming for two hours at a time in much warmer river waters in Tracadie-Sheila.
It was there that he picked up two oysters in one hand one day, and a crab in the other.
The crab grabbed his thumb, so he decided to bite its claws open with his teeth because he didn't want to drop the oysters in his other hand.
In no time, the crab was fastened to his lip.
"It was like, 'Welcome to Acadia, you Cajun,'" Michot said. "You've been gone."

Full text: My friend just came back from defending our country on her second tour of duty in the Iraq war. She risked her life to fight for everyone's freedom, including gays and lesbians. She safely returned home to seek solace on the loss of her fallen comrades.
She entered the Catholic church only to hear a message that would exclude a minority the basic freedom to marry whomever they love. She was saddened when she left and asked herself: What happened to the separation of church and state?
People can find anything they want in the Bible: that it's OK to sacrifice a child, own slaves, have more than one wife, and a sin to eat shellfish. Such people pick and choose what they want when it's convenient to them, and yet those doctrines change over time.
Why, all of a sudden, is the church so involved in a local political issue? Is this a way to divert attention from their recent bad behavior in regards to children being sexually abused by priests?
America is a diverse country with people from many backgrounds and viewpoints. Laws should not be based on anyone's faith or religious view. Laws should be based on fairness to all Americans. Do we want to become a society like the ones our soldiers are fighting against?

Full text: AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - Gov. John Baldacci is asking Maine's congressional delegation to explore emergency aid options to assist the state's shellfish industry in the wake of extensive red tide and flood closures.
Baldacci's office said Friday that officials at the Maine Department of Marine Resources think adverse conditions may restrict harvesting for weeks.
Baldacci noted that as of the end of last week, virtually the entire coastline was closed to the harvesting of shellfish.
The governor said the positive economic impact of Maine's shellfish industry is estimated at between $40 million and $50 million dollars annually.

Abstract: Their club dates to 1920, when members met once a month to listen to music, read poetry and show off collections comprised of things that cost little or no money. Hence dirt. Empty turtle shells. Neat jars stickered "Corn Products" from someone who apparently raided an old-time cereal cupboard ("Corn Kix," "Shredded Ralston"). "Imagine the work people put into this," she said. "It was their hobby; it was their thing to do. They didn't sit around watching TV - there was no TV."

TURNER - Maxine Hinkley tugged open two drawers she'd never opened before and gasped.
Stacks of bird bodies piled one on top of another. Feathers as fluffy as the day they dropped out of the sky a century ago.
And around each ankle, a little ID tag: Pine Siskin, 1892. Bay-breasted warbler, 1890.
The unexpected drawer of birds joined a dozen-plus stuffed animals displayed around the room. And a pine cone collection. A bird nest collection. A snake and snakeskin collection. A dirt collection in carefully labeled glass bottles, one with Dust Bowl dust.
"People collected everything in those days and thank God they did," said Hinkley, president of the Turner Natural History Club Museum.
The little rural club's seashells are considered so extraordinary the American Museum of Natural History in New York City swung by to borrow 900 in 1997. The curator of zoology at the Maine State Museum calls it a "phenomenal resource," maybe unique in Maine today.
Yet Hinkley's pretty sure that for the last two decades nearly no one knew what, or where, it was.
"Museum" was just recently added to the name, along with a new sign, phone number and e-mail. In a real sense, the place is dusting itself off.
Their club dates to 1920, when members met once a month to listen to music, read poetry and show off collections comprised of things that cost little or no money. Hence dirt. Empty turtle shells. Neat jars stickered "Corn Products" from someone who apparently raided an old-time cereal cupboard ("Corn Kix," "Shredded Ralston").
Back in the day, it all made for a fun evening out. Membership swelled to 100, Hinkley said.
"Imagine the work people put into this," she said. "It was their hobby; it was their thing to do. They didn't sit around watching TV - there was no TV."
Through an all-volunteer effort, they built the shallow white cape on 442 Turner Center Road as a clubhouse in 1930. Almost every room is lined with shelves or glass bookcases and taken up by something. As members died, they left the club intricate wood displays and hand-numbered envelopes stuffed with moss and lichen. Hundreds of rocks. Even a stuffed white baby seal.
The largest reserve is the seashells: Hinkley estimates the club has 50,000. Wing and pearl oysters. Tellins. Tun and fig shells. Janthina snails. Cowries.
A letter from the American Museum of Natural History that thanked the club for an indefinite loan of specimens like Hawaiian land snails said they would "greatly assist scientists around the world who frequently borrow such material for scientific research and education."
The labels and attention to detail give the club a "time capsule feel," said Paula Work at the Maine State Museum, who's driven out to visit. It's also a boon to those looking at issues like climate change.
"I was thrilled on two levels. One, that the center exists," she said. Second, that through a new grant to survey science collections around the state, she'll be able to offer some help.
"Those little 'aha' moments that are stored in drawers together, collectively, make these a phenomenal resource," Work said.
Today the club is at 14 members and doesn't meet monthly to read poetry and show off collections as much as to plan the future for the collections they've got, Hinkley said.
She's been president since February. Her husband, Homer, has been a member for 50 years. She plans to ask the town for help going forward with operating costs. This fall, she'll pursue grants. Next spring, she'd like to write its history.
On the group's to-do list is preserving the largely pristine stuffed specimens: Barred owls. Louisiana water thrush. A pair of yellow and green budgerigars, parakeet look-alikes that look like they could come to life.
How'd they fare so well over the decades left in the open air, in an unheated clubhouse?
Maine temperatures helped, Work said. Without much activity in the building, there wasn't much dust kicked up. And, it turns out, the liberal use of taxidermy poison provided an assist.
"Those birds are laden with arsenic, so they've become unpalatable to the insect world," Work said.

Special to the Sun Journal
If you're even considering going to the Grains and Grapes Festival next weekend at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston, go.
It's about time we got a festival like this. There are more than two dozen vintners in this state and about 30 breweries, a number within striking distance of the Twin Cities.
If you missed last year's festival, here's the deal. For $25, you get to sample 10 drinks, chosen from 50 ales, beers and wines. Servings are four ounces each for beer; two ounces for wine. That comes out to 21/2 pints of beer or four glasses of wine, or any combination of the two.
For most of us, that's enough that we'll want a cab or a designated driver, but not enough to embarrass ourselves. Perfect.
But if this were just about alcohol's effects, you could get that entire 40 ounces of beer for less than $3, or a jug of wine for about $5. You go to a beer and wine festival to sample. To try something new. To talk flavors, aromas, body, maybe even production techniques. (This festival will also offer up food, live music and prizes, but that's not why we're here, is it?)
You'll have three hours to take 20 to 30 sips, so savor each one as best you can. With both wine and craft beer, pay close attention to each drink; one may become a new favorite.
Where to begin? Start out taking a look at it. That's not snobby; it builds up anticipation and lets you discuss the drink before imbibing.
Is the beer clear or cloudy? Is it pitch black or are there reddish hues when you hold it up to the light? Does your wine have bluish-purple shades or is it bright red?
Then, swirl your glass around and take a whiff. Wine tasters divide the smell of wine into aroma - the fruity scents from the wine - and bouquet, which comes from the wine's aging and can include vanilla or mushroom smells.
Beer's scents come from the hops and malts. Some malts, like rye, are obvious on the nose. Barley can smell bready, especially darker malts. The hops can smell citrusy, piney or herbal, but don't assume too much. Brewers can create a hop bitterness and flavor that's somewhat different from the aroma.
Did you skip straight to the drinking part? That's OK. I usually do too. But even with drinking, there's a lot to consider.
With wine, take a sip and swirl it around a bit before swallowing.
Moreso than with beer, wine will taste like it smells. If you don't drink much wine, the subtler tastes from aging won't be apparent. Don't worry if you taste grapes - not hints of currant - in your merlot. Enjoy those grapes, but try to look for subtler flavors. What does it remind you of?
The same goes with mead. A meadery has plenty of honey varieties from which to choose. Sure it tastes like honey, but try to delve deeper.
And unless you're driving or in a situation where you're trying dozens of wines, swallow it. The back of your tongue is slightly better at detecting bitter flavors, so drink up. In fact, avoid tastings where you're trying a lot of wine or driving. You'll just be cheating yourself.
If anyone contests this, tell them you read it in the newspaper.
On to the beer. Take a big enough quaff that it hits your whole palate at once. Beer can't just be sipped, and no one ever spits out a sample. Is it thick or thin? Despite what many think, there are viscous lighter-colored beers, while some dark beers have a light consistency.
Let it stay on your tongue for just a moment to take in all the flavors. Beer often tastes more bitter than it smells, depending on how the brewer used the hops. Usually, you'll get the sweetness first and a slightly bitter finish. How's the aftertaste? The brewer's job is to make you want another sip. How did he or she do?
Remember that a lot of the beer you drink will be more complex than wine. That's not a slam on wine, but vintners blend batches and try to keep their flavors subtle.
Most beers, however, are single-batch, and their beers combine a variety of malt and hop varieties. In ales, the yeast also contributes to the flavor. It's a lot to take in. And while some brewers like Shipyard and Gritty's generally keep with subtler English styles, Maine brewers have increasingly followed the national trend toward bigger, more intense flavors.
Finally, a word of warning. When you're talking beer and wine with more experienced drinkers, don't be alarmed if someone mentions flavors of "mushrooms" or "old leather" in a bottle-aged wine. I've even heard the term "cat pee" lovingly used to describe an IPA (India pale ale).
Don't worry. I've never tasted cat pee, even in the most extreme IPA. And generally, those tastes are approximations of gentle flavors that are part of a whirlwind of subtle tastes.
So go. Look, smell, drink and discuss. Get a ride home, or maybe just a ride to the bar.
There will be two tasting sessions: from 3 to 6 p.m. and from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m.
FMI: http://www.mainegrainsandgrapes.com or call the Chamber at 783-2249.Breaking it down:
Wine and beer are complex beverages with a lot of flavors. Here are the main flavor components that make up fermented beverages.
Wine
Sweet: Residual sugar after fermentation contributes to wine's sweetness.
Examples: Syrah, riesling.
Dry: Thinner, often with a bit of bite from the alcohol.
Examples: Chardonnay, pinot noir.
Acidic: From natural acidity of the grapes used.
Example: Sauvignon blanc.
Bitterness: Often called "tannin."
Example: Cabernet sauvignon. To compare with a low-tannin wine, have a white zinfandel.
Aging: Aging: Look for mushroom or old leather notes in a bottle-aged wine. In an oak-aged wine, look for vanilla notes reminiscent of bourbon.
Beer
Malt: Malted barley is beer's fermentable sugar, but it's only a component of the taste. Malt can be roasted, caramelized or smoked, among others, to change the beer's flavor.
Examples: Caramelized malts in Scottish ale and brown ale. Roasted malts in stouts.
Hops: The acidic residue from hop cones give beer its bitterness. Hops can add citrus, grassy or herbal flavors.
Example: India Pale Ale
Yeast: In ales, the taste of yeast is usually noticeable. It can taste peppery in Belgian-style ales, or buttery in some British ales. Ales using wild yeast have a big dose of sourness.
Example: Belgian dubbel
Adjuncts: Fruit and spices are often added to Belgian-style ales.
Example: White ale
Aging: Aging is still relatively new for brewers, but Allagash and Geary's have offered oak-aged beers. Like wine, look for vanilla notes.The lowdown

Full text: During a five-hour stint over Memorial Day weekend, they waved claw and hoof to some 15,000 cars at the York toll plaza.
It was a May debut for D. Claude Lobster and Miles the Moose, though as Miles will tell you, he's an old pro at the meet-and-greet. This was the first time the Maine Turnpike Authority's costumed ambassadors waved hello to tourists; they've racked up a number of Labor Day good-byes. Miles also has a few parades and ribbon-cuttings under his fury belt.
As for today's b Section interview, all we can say is: Good luck getting a straight answer from this pair. We asked the questions; MTA spokesman Dan Paradee took dictation.
Names: Miles the Maine Turnpike Moose and D. Claude Lobster
Age: Miles, 10; D. Claude, 5
Live where? Yeah, like we're going to tell you.
Married, single, relationship?
Miles: We're two wild and crazy guys, dude! Well, actually, I'm wild and crazy, but D. Claude is still learning to break out of his shell.
D. Claude: Now look, the interview just started and I'm already turning red.
How did you both get the turnpike gig?
M: It was like American Idol, dude. I beat out a very talented black fly.
DC: I beat out a singing potato.
Given the economic climate, and in your cases the possible alternative - still being stuck in the deep Atlantic or the deep Maine woods - how lucky do you feel to have jobs?
M: Jobs? We're Maine icons. Icons don't have jobs. We do it because our public demands it.
What do most motorists say when they see you?
M: This is a family newspaper right? In that case, most people comment on my burly physique.
DC: I get the same. They're always trying to butter me up.
Tips for staying clean and fluffy among all that exhaust?
M: Hey, this is the Maine Turnpike, not the New Jersey Turnpike. We've got a nice ocean breeze at the York plaza.
What does the D stand for in D. Claude Lobster?
DC: Frank. Give me a break. My parents were shellfish, not scholars!
How is the social climate in light of your celebrity status?
M: Let me tell you, the cows really dig it.
DC: It's tough. Sometimes I feel trapped and I don't like being trapped.
Favorite food?
DC: Nothing tops a rotting fish head.
M: No question about it - lobster! Oh, sorry buddy.
Do you ever hang out at the same sushi bar with Oakie and Slugger?
M: Oh yeah man, we hang with those dudes all the time when we hit the big city. I could tell you stories...
DC: Don't believe a word he says. He's never been to the city and Oakie and Slugger wouldn't know him if they fell over him.
Movie you'd recommend to other costumed characters?
DC: "Claws"!!
M: "The Wizard of Oz," because when you're from Maine "there's no place like home!"
When not hanging out at the York toll plaza:
M and DC: We're usually hanging at the dry cleaners.

Detroit Free Press
Sniff the air. Smell those sizzling ribs or burgers? Outdoor grilling season has arrived.
Three out of four households own a grill or a smoker. In 2008, more than 16.7 million grills and smokers were shipped - an 18 percent increase since 2003, according to the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association.
And there's no shortage of new cookbooks devoted to the age-old method of cooking foods over a hot flame. More than a half-dozen new books on grilling came out this spring.
They range from those aimed at beginners needing Grilling 101 lessons and how-to tips to ones geared to average grillers who want to add more spark to their grilling repertoire and hone their skills.
If you already consider yourself an expert griller, there are books for the more adventuresome, including ones with directions for smoking and cooking over a wood fire, and ones with recipes from famed barbecue joints. Peach Pork Butt, anyone? Or perhaps barbecued goat?
But a common theme is that it's back to the basics of outdoor grilling without a lot of uncommon or expensive ingredients or methods.How to make the most of your barbecue
With a host of new cookbooks and plenty of magazines offering features on grilling, there's no excuse not to get outside and get started. It's time to shine the burger flipper, clean the grill and make sure the propane tank is filled or charcoal is at hand.
To help get you started, here's more dish from cookbooks, along with helpful tips gleaned from Food & Wine magazine's annual all-things-grilling issue. It highlights equipment and wine pairings for grilled foods, plus stories about grilling from such far-away places as Argentina and, closer to home, a Portland, Ore., Thai restaurant.
Included are 20 smart tips for everyday grilling, with thoughts and ideas from chefs and grilling experts. And, of course, there are plenty of mouth watering recipes.
Here are our five favorite tips:
Baste burgers with butter while they are on the grill. That helps the natural sugars caramelize.
Soak vegetables in ice water before grilling to keep them moist and crisp.
Tenderize meat in onion juice or in onions pureed in a food processor with ingredients such as parsley, salt and your favorite spices.
Grill your sauce on a stick. Thread tomatoes, onions, garlic and chiles on a skewer and grill. When the main dish is done, puree the grilled sauce ingredients and season with salt.
Use a citrus squeeze. Superstar chef Emeril Lagasse recommends having lemons, limes and oranges on hand for spritzing over meat, seafood and vegetables.
New this year from the folks at Weber-Stephen Products Co. (makers of Weber grills) is an e-mailed recipe of the week. You can sign up at www.webernation.com.
Jamie Purviance, author of "Weber's Way to Grill: The Step-by-Step Guide to Expert Grilling" (Sunset, $24.95), offers these simple steps for grilling ease:
Set up two or three heat zones, with a hot side and a cool side. "This way you are not locked into one heat if things aren't going right," says Purviance.
Oil the food, not the grill. The food will be less likely to stick and you will use less oil.
Keep the lid closed. That keeps the grate hotter for searing foods, prevents flare-ups because less air is getting in, and traps some of the smoke.Grilling techniques
What: "Soaked, Slathered & Seasoned: A Complete Guide to Flavoring Food for the Grill" by Elizabeth Karmel (Wiley, $19.95).
What's in it: Karmel, the author of "Taming the Flame," writes in this book that "The reason I fell in love with outdoor cooking is that it is the best way to prepare food, bar none." And her passion shows in this book, which is filled with plenty of recipes, ideas and ways to infuse flavor into grilled foods.

Serves: 6
Preparation time: 15 minutes (plus brining time)/ Total time: 2 hours
You will need a foil pan large enough to hold the pork for this recipe.
Ingredients:
4 cups Dr Pepper (not diet)
1/2 cup kosher salt
1 boneless center-cut pork loin, 3 to 4 pounds
Ingredients for glaze:
1 jar (9 ounces) tart cherry preserves
1/2 cup Dr Pepper
1/2 cup water
1 to 2 tablespoons minced canned chipotle in adobo
4 teaspoons Dijon mustard
For grilling:
Vegetable oil
Method:
Pour the soda into a large glass measure and slowly add the salt (the mixture may foam up quite a bit). Stir until the salt dissolves completely, 1 to 2 minutes. Place a large, disposable plastic bag inside a large bowl and carefully pour the brine into the bag.
Trim excess fat and silver skin from the pork. Submerge the pork in the brine, seal the bag, place in a large bowl and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
In a small bowl, combine the glaze ingredients.
Remove the pork from the bag and discard the brine. Pat dry with paper towels. Lightly coat the pork with the vegetable oil and let stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes before grilling. Prepare the grill for direct and indirect cooking over high heat.
Brush the cooking grates clean. Sear the pork over direct high heat, with the lid closed as much as possible, until the surface is well marked but not burned, 8 to 12 minutes, turning once.
Place a large disposable foil pan over indirect high heat and pour the glaze into the pan. Carefully transfer the pork to the pan and turn to coat with the glaze. Grill the pork over indirect high heat, with the lid closed as much as possible, until barely pink in the center and the internal center temperature reaches 145 degrees to 150 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes, turning in the glaze every 8 to 10 minutes. If the glaze gets too thick or starts to scorch, add a little water or more soda to the pan. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and let rest for about 5 minutes. Cut the pork crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices and serve with the remaining pan sauce on the side.

Abstract: If your schedule allows some flexibility, try to plant on an overcast and cool day rather than a sunny, warm one. The night before you plant, lightly water the area to be planted and water the plants very well. When it's time to dig, think wide not deep. A newly planted perennial puts roots out to the sides much more quickly than down, and many perennials don't ever put a lot of roots downward except those with taproots like lupines. If your soil has not been tilled or tends to be compacted, by all means dig a good 6 inches deeper and then backfill it, water it and let it settle. If it is too deep when you start to plant, just add some more soil back in the hole until the plant sits even with the top of the hole. Make the width of the hole at least twice as wide as the plant. When removing the plant from the pot, be gentle. If roots extend through the holes in the bottom of the pot, cut them off. Then tap the sides of the pot all around, place your hand with fingers on either side of the plant and tip the pot. The plant should slide out quite easily. If it does not, sit it back upright and hit the sides of the pot with more force and try again. If all else fails, get a sharp knife and cut up the sides of the pot. Do not pull on the plant in an attempt to get it out of the pot. When the plant goes into the hole, make sure the two parts created at the bottom of the rootball stay separated. Place the plant in the hole and arrange the roots out and away from the plant. Make sure that the plant level in the pot is now the plant level in the hole. You can accomplish this easily with a straight stick or a yardstick. Lay the stick across the hole and it should also touch the ground level on the plant. Now backfill the hole about one-third of the way and water around the plant, not over it. Let the water drain and check the depth of the plant. If the depth is correct, finish backfilling the hole and tamp the ground lightly with your hand. Do not step on it to do this and do not push heavily near the plant stem. Water thoroughly and fertilize lightly with an organic product such as Neptune's Harvest or another fish/shellfish emulsion.

Full text: Good morning! Well, everyone's garden should be popping up rather nicely considering the warm temperatures interspersed with long, gentle rains. We may not like gray, rainy days, but our gardens certainly do. In case you haven't noticed, the songbirds and the hummers are back and the bumblebees are bumbling along helping our gardens grow. I have seen two butterflies up here on the hill, but I think they were the early birds.
At this time of year, along with the plants coming up, our gardens often reveal something else - holes! Where once a plant flourished, alas, a hole is all that remains; and as keepers of growing things, it is our job to fill those holes.
Yippee, a trip to look at wonderful plants is required. The shopping/choosing is the easy part; it's the planting that is hard work. It is also the planting that will determine how well that beautiful new plant will do not only this season but in years ahead.
There are steps you should take to help ensure your new plants get a good start. First, when you pick a plant, don't instantly go for the one with blooms on it. Pick up a prospective plant and gently shake it back and forth. If it moves in the pot as one whole object, that plant is really rootbound. It has been my experience that a somewhat smaller plant that is secure within the pot is usually healthier. Look carefully at the foliage and you should see consistently healthy, green leaves. If a number of leaves are starting to yellow or wilt, this is not a good sign, even if the plant is in bloom.
Once you get your plant home, put it in a place where it gets dappled sunlight and water it faithfully until you can plant it. If you are doing several plants or a whole new section of garden, put in the time and effort to improve the soil before you plant. Add compost and maybe some good loam, depending on how long the area has been planted and in use. If the open space is large enough, till the soil throughout. If you are adding only one or two plants, you can amend the soil in the planting hole with compost as you plant.
When you get the plants home, place them into the spaces they will occupy and take a good hard look. This is especially important if you are planting a large space with many new plants. What you pictured in your head may look entirely different when you see the real plants sitting on the ground.
Always remember to adjust the plants for height so that wonderful little primrose isn't hidden behind the new coral bells. Take note of the information on the plant tag that gives you the maximum height and width of the plant when full grown. This will save you moving plants later on.
If your schedule allows some flexibility, try to plant on an overcast and cool day rather than a sunny, warm one. The night before you plant, lightly water the area to be planted and water the plants very well. When it's time to dig, think wide not deep. A newly planted perennial puts roots out to the sides much more quickly than down, and many perennials don't ever put a lot of roots downward except those with taproots like lupines. If your soil has not been tilled or tends to be compacted, by all means dig a good 6 inches deeper and then backfill it, water it and let it settle. If it is too deep when you start to plant, just add some more soil back in the hole until the plant sits even with the top of the hole. Make the width of the hole at least twice as wide as the plant.
Don't give it a tug
When removing the plant from the pot, be gentle. If roots extend through the holes in the bottom of the pot, cut them off. Then tap the sides of the pot all around, place your hand with fingers on either side of the plant and tip the pot. The plant should slide out quite easily. If it does not, sit it back upright and hit the sides of the pot with more force and try again. If all else fails, get a sharp knife and cut up the sides of the pot. Do not pull on the plant in an attempt to get it out of the pot.
When you get the plant out of the pot, check the roots. If they are circling around the bottom, gently tease them apart and out. This will help them root more swiftly. If the plant is entirely encircled with roots and there is little dirt visible, your plant is rootbound and you need to make a correction before planting. Take a sharp knife and slice the rootball about one-third of the way up toward the crown and separate the two parts that have been created. Try to loosen the roots on the sides higher up on the rootball. If you cannot loosen them, a small slice on each side can be made.
When the plant goes into the hole, make sure the two parts created at the bottom of the rootball stay separated. Place the plant in the hole and arrange the roots out and away from the plant. Make sure that the plant level in the pot is now the plant level in the hole. You can accomplish this easily with a straight stick or a yardstick. Lay the stick across the hole and it should also touch the ground level on the plant. Now backfill the hole about one-third of the way and water around the plant, not over it. Let the water drain and check the depth of the plant. If the depth is correct, finish backfilling the hole and tamp the ground lightly with your hand. Do not step on it to do this and do not push heavily near the plant stem. Water thoroughly and fertilize lightly with an organic product such as Neptune's Harvest or another fish/shellfish emulsion.
You need to water these new transplants faithfully for a minimum of two weeks. They will need more attention than the established plants around them. Go easy on full-strength fertilizers on new plants in the first season.
So, it's time to go shopping and look at all the wondrous offerings out there at your local nurseries and gardens, because one of the best parts of gardening is getting to make your choice.
Until next time, watch for the hummers and maybe put out their feeder, because there are not a lot of flowers yet. Look for the indigo buntings and the rosy grosbeaks and, if you believe in the wisdom of lore, don't plant those annuals until after the last full moon of the month. And don't forget to honor the fallen by flying your flag for Memorial Day and saying thank-you to every veteran you may encounter.
Happy gardening!

Before you know it, the critters will start appearing in the garden. If you want to know whether it is a good or bad bug and what to do if it's bad, check out this Website, www.gardeners.com. There is a pest and disease finder that works quite easily along with earth-friendly solutions to problems. Just hit the learning tab once you get on the site.
For those of you with ponds in your landscapes, I learned at the Maine Garden Day put on by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension in March that if you add barley straw, it will keep the water clear. The barley straw won't harm people, pets or the flowering plants that grow in ponds. It just needs to be put in some kind of floating container that the water will pass through.

Full text: THOMASTON - Rain or shine, each morning Alvin Dennison drives his customized pickup truck to his turnout off Route 1 in Thomaston and arranges the red, white and blue signs advertising his wares.
Lobster, fresh mussels, clams. Shrimp meat, scallops, haddock.
Selling seafood from a truck on the side of the road is no way to get rich, especially this year, Dennison said, but it's a living.
"If I work every day, I can still scrape out a dollar," the white-bearded Owls Head man said on Friday. "I'm going to do this as long as I can stand here and shoot the breeze. I might have my wife push me around, but I'll be here."
Traffic whooshed by on the rainy road as Dennison, 61, weighed clams and bagged lobsters for his intermittent customers. They pulled over despite the dreary weather and made cheerful small talk as they paid him in cash.
"It's the best and the freshest seafood on the midcoast," said Don Gjertsen of South Thomaston, who has shopped at Dennison's truck for five years.
That truck, officially a licensed mobile vendor with the state of Maine, has been parked at the turnoff on Dragon Cement land for much longer. Dennison first set up shop there in 1993, a few years after the closure of his long-time employer, National Sea Products in Rockland.
The Vietnam veteran is a fixture on the coast, with regular customers and an inimitable sense of style. Weathered American flags dot the turnoff, and there is room in the jumble of patriotic seafood price lists for a hand-painted POW-MIA sign. "You are not forgotten," it reads, in stark white on black.
Dennison was drafted and served as a supply clerk with the Army's 1st Logistical Command.
"I came home from 'Nam in '69," Dennison said. "If I had known then what I know now, I would have been here in '69. You can't get a better job. I get to talk to everybody."
In fact, he enjoys his work so much that he said he's encouraged several other people to get into the business. Dennison is happy to share some trade secrets.
"I'm a good gabber," he said. "Being a veteran helps a lot, too."
Dennison figures most of the area veterans have stopped by his truck. Generating a regular clientele helps keep him in clams - of both the literal and figurative varieties - as does the fact that his business has low overhead.
Most of his products come from Maine Shellfish Co., which delivers right to the truck, and he hardly buys anything straight from the fishermen. Dennison keeps his markup around 25 percent, he said, lower than it is at most stores.
It's not easy money.
"A lot of days you don't gross $100," he said. "I might make $25 or $30, depending on what sold. To make a living like I do, you have to work seven days a week."
There are plenty of slow hours, which he fills in the cab of the red Dodge Ram by listening to talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh. While 99 percent of his clientele know his politics, he doesn't put up signs in election years.
"Nope. I don't want to kill my business," Dennison said.
When asked about his best day at the truck, he remembered a New Year's Eve several years ago when customers lined up for hours in the rain, chatting together as they waited for their orders.
But then Dennison smiled behind his beard.
"I figure every day is the best day," he said. "I'm up, I'm alive, I've got my health."

Abstract: Hepatitis is liver-cell inflammation with death of some of the cells. It can come from poisons like carbon tetrachloride, from alcohol, from fat invasion of the liver, from some bacteria and from viruses, among which are the hepatitis A, B and C viruses. In the acute stages of hepatitis, all these causes produce a similar illness - yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), great fatigue, loss of appetite, fever and profound mental fogginess. Sometimes the initial attack is so mild that the symptoms aren't appreciated. What happens after the initial illness is quite different for the different causes. Hepatitis C is spread from unclean needles, from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery, from sex with many partners or from blood transfusions given before 1992. Not all cases have an easily identified infection source. Eighty percent of the infected stay infected for life, but signs of infection don't become apparent until 20 or more years after being infected. Around 20 percent of the persistently infected develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. The booklet on hepatitis A, B and C provides more details on these infections. Readers can order a copy by writing: Dr. [DONOHUE] - No. 503, Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Enclose a check or money order (no cash) for $4.75 U.S./$6 Can. with the recipient's printed name and address. Please allow four weeks for delivery.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Will you please write about hepatitis A, B and C? When I was young, I had yellow jaundice and was very sick. I don't understand hepatitis A, B and C. It is related to yellow jaundice, I think. - R.M.
ANSWER: A discussion of hepatitis A, B and C requires 20 pages. The best I can do is a brief summary.
Hepatitis is liver-cell inflammation with death of some of the cells. It can come from poisons like carbon tetrachloride, from alcohol, from fat invasion of the liver, from some bacteria and from viruses, among which are the hepatitis A, B and C viruses. In the acute stages of hepatitis, all these causes produce a similar illness - yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), great fatigue, loss of appetite, fever and profound mental fogginess. Sometimes the initial attack is so mild that the symptoms aren't appreciated. What happens after the initial illness is quite different for the different causes.
Hepatitis A most often comes from contamination of food, water, milk, shellfish or even vegetables. The illness usually gets better on its own, although in rare cases it can be fatal. It does not cause a chronic infection. This is probably the kind you had.
Hepatitis B is transmitted through the sharing of injection needles, from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery and from sexual relations. In some, the reason for transmission isn't found. From 1 percent to 5 percent of those infected will have a persisting infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or death.
Hepatitis C is spread from unclean needles, from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery, from sex with many partners or from blood transfusions given before 1992. Not all cases have an easily identified infection source. Eighty percent of the infected stay infected for life, but signs of infection don't become apparent until 20 or more years after being infected. Around 20 percent of the persistently infected develop cirrhosis or liver cancer.
The booklet on hepatitis A, B and C provides more details on these infections. Readers can order a copy by writing: Dr. Donohue - No. 503, Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Enclose a check or money order (no cash) for $4.75 U.S./$6 Can. with the recipient's printed name and address. Please allow four weeks for delivery.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I have a sister who has narcolepsy. She thinks a head injury as a teen brought it on. It has been a source of embarrassment for her all her life. Is it hereditary? I heard of a family in Italy in which four sisters had it. I have no symptoms, but I do have sleep apnea. Is that considered to have any relation with it? - M.S.
ANSWER: Sleep apnea has nothing in common with narcolepsy except the symptom of daytime sleepiness.
Narcolepsy is the irresistible urge to fall asleep during the day in inappropriate times and places, like while driving a car. It has been reported to result from a head injury, but that's true only in a minority. It does have a genetic basis too, but that does not mean all family members have it.
Cataplexy is another feature. It's the loss of muscle tone due to intense emotion, like anger or convulsive laughter. The result can be imperceptible, like the dropping of the jaw, or quite dramatic, as in falling to the ground. Hallucinations at the onset of sleep or upon wakening are another aspect of narcolepsy. So is sleep paralysis, a transient inability to move upon wakening. Not all these symptoms are present in all narcolepsy patients.
Provigil, Ritalin and Concerta are examples of medicines used for narcolepsy control.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I am 85 and in good health, I think. Does the male body stop manufacturing semen at an advanced age? - W.S.
ANSWER: The production of sperm and seminal fluid lessens with age, but usually doesn't come to a complete stop.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I am a woman with breast cancer that has spread to bone. Can you direct me to a source of information on this? - C.W.
ANSWER: The Bone and Cancer Foundation is a new source of information about cancer that has spread to bone. Cancers that are prone to do so include breast, prostate and lung cancers. The foundation has six recently published booklets concerning bone spread of cancer, available on the foundation's Web site, www.boneandcancerfoundation.org, or by phone at 888-862-0999. There is no charge involved. The Bone and Cancer Foundation is a program of the Paget Foundation, which has been providing excellent information on bone disorders to patients for 30 years.
Dr. Donohue regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but he will incorporate them in his column whenever possible. Readers may write him or request an order form of available health newsletters at P.O. Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Readers may also order health newsletters from www.rbmamall.com.

Proof of gout is finding uric acid crystals

Author: Anonymous

Abstract: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I'm just an old country woman who needs to know more about gout. I have it at least twice a year, and it's so painful I can't put my foot to the floor. Please list the things not to eat so that I can kind of keep it under control. - E.W. ANSWER: Uric acid crystals that bore their way into joints are the cause of gout. Uric acid is a byproduct of the daily turnover of body cells. As long as blood uric acid stays within a normal range, all is well. When its blood level rises, the uric acid infiltrates joints and causes intense joint pain, swelling, redness and heat. The gout diet is not very restrictive. In the days before medicines effectively controlled gout, diet was the only remedy. It's in second place these days. The consumption of red meat and especially organ meat (kidneys, heart, liver, brain and sweetbreads) should be minimized. It's best to avoid gravies. Seafood, especially anchovies, sardines and shellfish, should be eaten in moderation. Alcohol - beer in particular - can provoke an attack. All vegetables and fruits are permitted, and low-fat dairy products appear to prevent attacks.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I'm just an old country woman who needs to know more about gout. I have it at least twice a year, and it's so painful I can't put my foot to the floor. Please list the things not to eat so that I can kind of keep it under control. - E.W.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I woke up with severe pain in my large toe. The pain got to be unbearable, and I then went to the emergency room. The doctor informed me I had gout. Please help me understand it. - W.B.
ANSWER: Uric acid crystals that bore their way into joints are the cause of gout. Uric acid is a byproduct of the daily turnover of body cells. As long as blood uric acid stays within a normal range, all is well. When its blood level rises, the uric acid infiltrates joints and causes intense joint pain, swelling, redness and heat.
Gout mostly happens to middle-aged to older men and to women who have gone through menopause. The base of the big toe is often the first joint to suffer an attack. Further attacks can target the heels, ankles, knees, elbows, wrists and fingers.
The definitive proof of gout is finding uric acid crystals in joint fluid. A rise in blood uric acid level is another tip.
The gout diet is not very restrictive. In the days before medicines effectively controlled gout, diet was the only remedy. It's in second place these days. The consumption of red meat and especially organ meat (kidneys, heart, liver, brain and sweetbreads) should be minimized. It's best to avoid gravies. Seafood, especially anchovies, sardines and shellfish, should be eaten in moderation. Alcohol - beer in particular - can provoke an attack. All vegetables and fruits are permitted, and low-fat dairy products appear to prevent attacks.
Gout medicines are of two varieties: ones for an acute attack and ones for prevention. Indomethacin is an example of medicine for an acute attack, as is colchicine. Zyloprim (allopurinol) and Benemid (probenecid) prevent attacks. Zyloprim decreases uric acid production, and Benemid enhances its excretion by the kidneys.
The pamphlet on gout discusses this common ailment in greater detail. To order a copy, write: Dr. Donohue - No. 302, Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Enclose a check or money order (no cash) for $4.75 U.S./$6 Can. with the recipient's printed name and address. Please allow four weeks for delivery.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: For four years I have been dealing with lichen planus. Is there any new treatment? - J.P.
ANSWER: Lichen planus is most often found on the skin of the wrists, ankles and legs. It can also find its way into the mouth. The genital skin, including the area around and inside the vagina, is another target. It starts as flat-topped, many-sided, small red patches that can merge into a larger patch. The color turns purple. White lines crisscross the surface of the patch. The outbreak is intensely itchy. A cause hasn't been identified, but it might result from an immune system gone berserk. Sometimes it's seen in conjunction with another illness, like hepatitis C.
The strongest varieties of cortisone creams and ointments are the usual treatment. Many patients are free of the condition in a year or so. To prevent relapses, some have to keep applying the ointments on a less-frequent basis once the skin has cleared.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I read your article on dry eyes. My wife has this problem. She was examined by an eye doctor, who advised GenTeal gel, an eye ointment. She has been using it regularly since 2002, and it has worked wonders for her. It is relatively inexpensive. - P.K.
ANSWER: Many thanks for letting people with dry eyes know how well your wife has done with the product. It also comes as a solution of artificial tears.
People with dry eyes must first find out what's causing the problem. One of the big causes is Sjogren's syndrome, which also can produce dry mouth.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: My wife, 76, has degenerative arthritis of the spine. Can you tell me if this condition will progress to total disability? - J.D.
ANSWER: Degenerative arthritis is another name for osteoarthritis, the most common kind of arthritis. Almost every 70-year-old has a touch of it. It can be in the back, knee, hip, hand, fingers and ankle, or any of these locations. The rate of progression is unpredictable. A good many can continue to do most of the activities of life with minimum disruption.
Dr. Donohue regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but he will incorporate them in his column whenever possible. Readers may write him or request an order form of available health newsletters at P.O. Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Readers may also order health newsletters from www.rbmamall.com.

Abstract: It was a Saturday night and we were fishing for smelt in one of Jim Worthing's camps on the Kennebec River in Randolph. Worthing's is one of those places where you just show up. They give you a bag of bait and you fork over $35 for a three-man shack, $45 for a four-man shack or $65 for spacious six-man accommodations. There were three of us inside our shack. There is just enough room in there to cut bait and tend to the lines. Don't plan on doing jumping Jacks. You'll want to stow your beer outside in the snow because otherwise, you'll trip over the 12-pack and go headlong into the trough. The culture of smelting is a boisterous one and its rituals include beer and howling that increases in volume as the six-hour tide progresses. Smelting is the rock-n'-roll show of the sport of fishing. The shacks are separated by just three feet of snow and ice. You will hear your neighbor's every thought and his every belch. You will hear him lie over and over about the number of smelts he has hooked.

Full text: Wintertime, and the smelting is easy. Real easy ... once you get past the bait from Hades.
RANDOLPH - You know, Ernest Hemingway roamed the African jungles, going toe-to-toe with killer lions and tigers in search of his own machismo. Jack London labored as an oyster pirate and ran with wolves in the great white north.
Me, I have a problem with bloodworms.
Horrific creatures, the bloodworm has a billion legs and a mouth that unfolds into a terrifying set of fangs and antennae. Hack one up into 20 pieces and each piece will continue to thrash and lunge at your fingers.
I don't know about you, but I like my severed body parts to stay dead.
The bloodworm is horror-movie ugly. You know the creature that menaced Sigourney Weaver in "Alien?" The bloodworm would kick its derriere.
"Do they bite?" I asked David Saucier, my father-in-law and a veteran of smelting.
"Only the head," he said.
So you cut the head off first and fling it away. Then you have only to contend with the army of dancing legs as you bait your hook.
It was a Saturday night and we were fishing for smelt in one of Jim Worthing's camps on the Kennebec River in Randolph. Worthing's is one of those places where you just show up. They give you a bag of bait and you fork over $35 for a three-man shack, $45 for a four-man shack or $65 for spacious six-man accommodations.
There are 50 of these shacks clustered together near the shore of the Kennebec. From a distance, it looks like a weird refugee camp, where instead of quietly musing their new freedom, the refugees drink beer and holler loudly every time a new fish is plucked from the water.
The shacks are basic. Wooden stools for each person who will fish, a wood stove to keep them warm and a long trough cut into the ice on one side.
Each person drops six lines into the roughly eight-foot-by-one-foot trough and then sits down to watch the rows of bobbers that look like oversized Lifesavers.
A note to the aspiring smelter fisherman: Though Worthing's provides most of what you'll need to pull tiny fish and your own manhood from the icy water, you will want to bring a bucket, or even two.
This is not the kind of fishing where you nap on a wharf and rouse only once an hour to check your line. Smelt are a very accommodating species. They somewhat fling themselves onto your lines, and your arms will go numb hauling them up fist-over-fist. They never swallow the hook. The fish are roughly six inches long and there are no painful barbs to spear your hands on when you remove them from the line.
Smelt are fish that want to be caught.
There were three of us inside our shack. There is just enough room in there to cut bait and tend to the lines. Don't plan on doing jumping Jacks. You'll want to stow your beer outside in the snow because otherwise, you'll trip over the 12-pack and go headlong into the trough.
"We're going to need a bigger shack," I said at one point. Nobody got it.
Theoretically, you can cook on top of the wood stove, although unless you have one of the bigger shacks, don't bother trying. The attention required for cooking is attention you will need to give to your lines in the water.
Here's what happens. One of the oversized Lifesavers will begin to move with obvious agitation from below. This almost always means there is a fish on you line way down there in the cold and dark. How you bring it up depends on your individual technique. Mine involves grabbing the line and yanking upwards.
I'm self-taught, you know.
For the first half-hour, we kept a count of our fish. We got to 10. Then two, three or even four of the bobbers would begin to move at once and smelts started coming into the shack as though they had been standing in line just to take a place in our inventory.
There is very little difficulty to smelting, which is good for a hack fisherman like me who routinely gets lines caught in trees, power lines and other anglers when I'm fishing the traditional way.
The lines rarely tangle. You don't lose hooks or bobbers and there is no casting to complicate things. Unwind your line according to desired depth and wait for the action.
A word to the smelt virgin. This is not the kind of quiet fishing you remember from long summer days with your favorite grandpappy. You will not lose yourself in quiet solitude while angling this way.
The culture of smelting is a boisterous one and its rituals include beer and howling that increases in volume as the six-hour tide progresses. Smelting is the rock-n'-roll show of the sport of fishing. The shacks are separated by just three feet of snow and ice. You will hear your neighbor's every thought and his every belch. You will hear him lie over and over about the number of smelts he has hooked.
There was no need for prevarication in our shack. After five-and-a-half hours, our plastic bag runneth over with smelts. The final count: 78 of the coveted fish.
The last time I landed 78 fish in one outing was approximately never.
There is a tradition in the smelting community wherein a rookie is expected to bite off the head of his first fish. I was not asked to do it and I'm thankful for that. Although given the choice, I would happily chew a dozen of the fish raw than spend an up-close moment with the "Fear Factor" bloodworm. Those babies are best left in their natural domain: the nightmare.Go and do

Abstract: Mrs. Mark Merrow of Auburn thinks that if people don't believe that chickens pay they better talk with her. From thirty hens in the month of December she got two hundred and twenty seven eggs and in the month of January three hundred and forty eight. Almost forty-eight dozen, and with prices ranging from forty-five to fifty cents a dozen, this seems to mean a good margin of profit. Mrs Merrow attributes her success to a liberal ration of chopped beets together with cooked meat, oyster shells and charcoal in addition to the usual corn and oats.50 years ago, 1959

In preparation for the observance of Crime Prevention Week Feb. 8-14, Auburn police Chief Alton E. Savage spoke yesterday at the weekly meeting of the Lewiston Exchange Club at the DeWitt Hotel. Stating that the police force should be looked upon as a friend of the public rather than a stern disciplinarian, Chief Savage illustrated the point by the force's work in the Police Athletic League and other organizations.25 years ago, 1984
For almost three weeks there was no word from solo sailor Bill Dunlop, now crossing the Pacific on his around-the-world voyage. But word was received in his hometown of Mechanic Falls Thursday that Dunlop is northeast of the Galapagos Islands on the leg of his trip which will take him to French Polynesia.
His wife, Pamela, received word late Thursday afternoon that Dunlop and his tiny craft Wind's Will were spotted by the tanker Stolt Boel, approximately 450 miles northeast of the main island of the Galapagos group.
The master of the tanker said in his telex transmission that Dunlop's message home was, "Going OK, but slow." It was the first word Mrs. Dunlop had received from her husband since he sailed out of Panama at 10:30 a.m. Jan. 14.

Blue jays may peck paint for calcium

Abstract: Another strategy is to supply the birds with what may be lacking in their diet. Offer them eggshells crumbled into small pieces and placed near feeders. These are often consumed by the jays in winter probably because the eggshells contain reserves of calcium. Try putting them out in a flat dish on a platform feeder where there are sunflower seeds that will also attract the jays. You may want to start by putting the eggshells near the area where the birds are pecking your paint, then gradually moving them away so the jays will no longer be attracted to your house.

Full text: Dear Sun Spots: I have a unique problem; perhaps your readers can help. There is a flock of blue jays in my area which visit my house frequently to peck the paint off the lower clapboards and other places they can reach. How can I discourage them? Shooting them is not a practical option. - DWC, No Town.
Answer: The New Hampshire Audubon says that the reason the birds peck and consume the paint is not clear, but they think since paint has calcium in it, the jays are seeking the calcium from the paint. Paint pecking is most often reported during the winter, when snow covers the ground and the birds do not have access to dirt, earth and sand, which may provide their usual supply of minerals. So, they may be attempting to supplement their diet.
They offer two possible solutions. The first is to make the area inaccessible to the birds. They suggest observing the exact locations the birds are most interested in and try covering the area with heavy plastic, chicken wire or small-mesh plastic garden netting.
Another strategy is to supply the birds with what may be lacking in their diet. Offer them eggshells crumbled into small pieces and placed near feeders. These are often consumed by the jays in winter probably because the eggshells contain reserves of calcium. Try putting them out in a flat dish on a platform feeder where there are sunflower seeds that will also attract the jays. You may want to start by putting the eggshells near the area where the birds are pecking your paint, then gradually moving them away so the jays will no longer be attracted to your house.
Note that you will need to replace the shells if they are covered by snowfall, as the birds will not search for them, but more likely will return to the paint on your house. Also, egg shells may contain salmonella bacteria and it is best to boil the shells for 10 minutes or heat them in the oven for 20 minutes at 250 degrees, let them cool and crush them.
The Stanton Bird Club also notes that an alternative to egg shells is oyster shells, which are available at Paris Farmers Union, for 45 cents per pound or $12.49 for 50 pounds.
Dear Sun Spots: Does anyone have any old-fashioned iron radiators they want out of the way? I am looking for a couple for reasonable cost or for pickup. Please call 897-4954. Thanks. - No Name, Livermore Falls.

Full text: Sparks the Rescue signed, sealed and ready to deliver. Band released latest album, now comes the tour.
Upstream. Autumn.
Within the first few minutes of the Sparks the Rescue interview, the two words were mentioned. My first thoughts were flyfishing and foliage. But after talking with the guys, I realize we're talking about one heavily airplayed single - "Autumn" - from a local band with a brand-new, national recording contract.
More like hot summer whitewater.
After showcasing for several record companies in California, the band - Ben Briggs (bass), Alex Roy (vocals), Patrick O'Connell (guitar and vocals), Toby McAllister (guitar and vocals) and Nate Spencer (drums) - has secured a contract.
Photo Finish/Atlantic Records offered the Portland-based band an "upstream" contract after weeks of negotiating. That basically means they sign and work with Photo Finish, a smaller division of the label, and then, once they have their feet wet, Atlantic will take over the contract, moving them from the pond to the ocean. They will officially be signing in two weeks.
"We showcased for all the major labels and we didn't know which one was going to take us on; which one we were going to work with," Briggs said.You must be joking
These guys have had their share of frustration, and despite all being in their early 20s, have certainly paid their dues. Booking their own shows and promoting the band - formerly known as Pozer - since they began in 1999 has been a full-time job, as well as the occasional headache.
There's been a lot of learning along the way. Some of the shows they booked ended up being in undesirable locations or without the necessary audio equipment. One show, it turned out, was in the middle of a field for only a handful of people - and an overwhelming number of lovebugs, which breed in large numbers during May and September.
"It (the show) was during their peak mating season and we got attacked," Roy said.
Another booking surprise: Some of the venues wanted the band to pay to play.
"One place was like If 75 people don't show up, you have to pay for the venue,'" Spencer said.
Over the past 10 years, they've played more than 200 shows throughout New England and shared the stage with bands like Saosin, Glory of This, The Static Age and Hawthorne Height.
But that, we now know, was just their warm-up. Practicing three days a week in a garage at Briggs Equipment Sales in Gray, owned by Briggs father, Sparks the Rescue members said recently they couldn't wait for their first legitimate tour to begin. And it did, two days ago on Jan. 16.
"We're psyched to go on tour, a real tour with real guarantees every night. Real rooms. It's going to be great," McAllister said last week.
Their new booking agent is out of Beverly Hills, Calif. - a sign the band has definitely taken a big step in the right direction.
Roy said that what happens with many new bands who sign with major labels is the label pushes singles to radio stations across the U.S. and there's not much to support it. If the band doesn't gain an audience, the label typically moves onto other bands.
The band has been receiving airplay in Maine and parts of New England - off both their EP "The Secrets We Keep" and their newly released LP "Eyes to the Sun" - long enough to see there is a market for their sound. The sound on the EP was heavier and its reach was limited to a specific audience. The LP brings a new, more commercially appealing mix of melody and youthful rock. Starting with a subsidiary like Photo Finish will give them the opportunity to maximize that, as well as generate a wider audience.
"We get to tour, sell some records and get that stuff under our belt, and then the major label can take us at any point," Briggs said.
A month after this brief tour, the band will head to both California and New Jersey to play Bamboozle, a 4-year old, two- to three-day music festival featuring national and smaller acts on each coast.
"It's cool to look at our tour slip and see 50,000 tickets, because it's expected to sell out," Spencer said.Aw shucks, it's just us
Their first single - "Autumn," off "Eyes to the Sun" - has been on heavy rotation on WCYY. The guys say that no matter how many times they hear the song, it's still amazing to them to hear it on the radio.
"The other day I was going somewhere sort of public, and I always feel weird if I'm listening to us, you know, cause like it's us, and I put on the radio real quick and 'Autumn' was on. I can't get away from it," Briggs laughed.
The five-man band is down to earth; members don't seem in danger of forgetting their roots anytime soon. I'm betting they can strike up a conversation with nearly anyone and immediately impress them with how genuine they are.
"When I was a kid, I remember Jeremiah Freed being played on the radio, and other bands like Even All Out and Rustic Overtones, and just looking up to them thinking and being like Wow, I hope someday that will happen,'" Roy said. "It's just crazy to be there and think that maybe kids are doing the same thing to us."Sparks the Rescue fact sheet
Interests:
Range from disc golf and hacky sack to photography and men's league hockey. Van karaoke is a band favorite and a must when they are on the road - particularly, they say, "Banana phone" by Raffi.
"I like romance novels," McAllister admitted. "I really like 'Twilight.' I read three of the books and I want more."
"I like school on the road. I'm enrolled at the University of Phoenix online; if I'm in school I get to keep my health insurance. No, I'm going to school for business, but I do get to keep my health insurance," Spencer said.
Favorite Web sites:
absolutepunk.net (McAllister)
Twitter (Briggs)
stumbleupon.com (Spencer)
Music:
The band listens to anything from folk and soft rock to '90s and classic bands like Pink Floyd and Boston.
Food:
Spencer and Roy go for deep-fried mac and cheese; Briggs is into broccoli and rice at the moment; buffalo chicken is McAllister's choice; O'Connell's favorite foods are Japanese, like shabu and tempura. They all like lobster, except for McAllister, who is allergic to shellfish and nuts.

Abstract: On the private chef job (in Bar Harbor), the first dinner was what one would consider a full Thanksgiving dinner; as the client expressed, "We thought the house would smell great, we could give proper thanks for being there and for your help." The menu was roast turkey with wild rice, sausage and apple stuffing, horseradish and sour cream mashed potatoes, herb and lemon green beans and balsamic cranberry relish. First meal you made as a gourmet chef? As a personal chef, the first dinner was an anniversary dinner for my best friend. The menu was cucumber-avocado soup, marinated flank steak served with a black bean and vegetable salad, garlic mashed potatoes and French bread. Desert was a cool raspberry soup.

As The Tailgate Gourmet, Wyman's going into homes in Androscoggin, Cumberland and Sagadahoc counties planning menus and meals, everything from a Wednesday night dinner to a Saturday night dinner party.
Wyman launched the business in August after a monthlong job in Bar Harbor as the private chef for a Florida attorney and his family. At the last minute, the chef that the man had planned to use in Maine got another offer - to chef on a yacht in Hawaii.
"Lucky for me," Wyman said.
Read on with caution. There's a very high risk of salivating.

The menu was roast turkey with wild rice, sausage and apple stuffing, horseradish and sour cream mashed potatoes, herb and lemon green beans and balsamic cranberry relish.
Favorite vegetable to work with? Personally, it has to be fresh chile pepper because it is so versatile and has so many varieties and heat levels available; the heat and flavor can change dramatically depending upon how the pepper is prepared. For clients it would be an entirely different choice - after all, my job is to please their palate not mine.
Favorite protein? I would have to say scallops. I love the sweetness. They also bring back memories of childhood and the very simple but delicious, elegant, pan-seared scallop dinners my mother would fix when scallops were in season.
Wearing a tall, pleated white cap while you cook: Yeah or nay? Nay, but I do wear a cap or visor.
Sure I'll make it, but there's no way I'll eat: Wow, there are a few that would fit into this category and I must say that I have tried these on at least one occasion: squid, octopus, liver and onions, mountain oysters.
Something a lot of us do wrong in the kitchen that we could easily do right: Again, there are a number of easily corrected "mistakes" made in the kitchen. Probably the easiest one to correct is seasoning and tasting. You should always taste and season as you cook with a final adjustment just before the dish is finished. This tasting should include the ingredients that go into the dish as they can have an effect on the overall seasoning that is used.
Would you rather: Chef on a yacht in Hawaii, on a catamaran in the Mediterranean, or on a schooner in New England? I would choose the catamaran in the Mediterranean. There a so many possible ports of call and great, simple cuisines available in that area: Spanish, North African, and Italian to mention a few; add in the regional and ethnic cuisines and it may be a long voyage.

Abstract: Has struggled with an eating disorder: For an anorexic, large amounts of food can be horrifying; for an overeater it's an invitation to binge, said Cynthia Bulik, director of the eating disorders program at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Instead, offer small portion sizes and small plates. Try not to push food, comment on how much someone is eating or say, "You look so good!" The person with anorexia hears, "Thank goodness you put weight on." Is newly divorced or separated: Have someone close to the recently single person talk to them in private before the gathering.

Full text: Holiday gatherings are fraught with delicate situations. Should you offer the recovering alcoholic a drink? What if your niece with an eating disorder isn't eating? How do you wish "happy" anything to a recent divorcee?
It's almost enough to drive a prospective host under the bed until January. But don't despair. With a little planning - and sensitivity training - you can ease the tension that inevitably builds around annual festivities that focus on excessive food, drink and togetherness.
"The things you say can ignite bombs or defuse them," said Jill Brooke, a certified stepfamily coach and editor of FirstWivesWorld.com, a virtual community for women transitioning through divorce. "If you want to be the architect of your own happiness, take a leadership role. Be prepared."
Always start by having someone close to your guest ask about any special needs ahead of time.
"Involve them in the discussion so they're not blindsided," said alcoholism recovery pioneer Karen Casey, who has written more than a dozen books on the topic.If your guest...
Has struggled with an eating disorder: For an anorexic, large amounts of food can be horrifying; for an overeater it's an invitation to binge, said Cynthia Bulik, director of the eating disorders program at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Instead, offer small portion sizes and small plates. Try not to push food, comment on how much someone is eating or say, "You look so good!" The person with anorexia hears, "Thank goodness you put weight on."
Say this: "It's great to have you here with us."
Is a recovering alcoholic: Try not to make someone who isn't drinking feel like a party pooper. People who have undergone treatment might be struggling with a variety of triggers, including people, places, times and smells, said Dr. Morteza Khaleghi, a psychoanalyst and addiction specialist who wrote "Free From Addiction" (Palgrave MacMillan, $14.95). Find out whether your guest is comfortable around alcohol or whether you should serve drinks in a discreet place or throw an alcohol-free party.
Say this: "What would you like to drink?"
Has food allergies: If several guests have different food allergies - or you've got a vegan, meat lover and raw foodist coming - organize a potluck meal. If you're unsure about allergies, consider eliminating dishes that contain the most common and dangerous food allergens: peanuts, tree nuts and shellfish. Or provide a basic dish with sauces - often a source of hidden allergens - on the side, according to the Food Allergy Initiative (faiusa.org.)
Say this: "If you'd like to double-check the ingredient label, I saved it for you."
Is newly divorced or separated: Have someone close to the recently single person talk to them in private before the gathering. "Ask whether it's a taboo subject or whether they care if we ask how it's going," said Cheryl Dellasega, author of "Forced to Be Family" (Wiley, $24.95) and a professor of humanities and women's studies at Pennsylvania State University. Don't ask "Who are you dating?" or be nosy under the guise of love.

Has lost a loved one: Most people do want to talk about the death of a loved one immediately after the loss, according to John James and Russell Friedman, Founders of The Grief Recovery Institute. They suggest bringing up the topic in a sensitive way. Then let the person decide whether to talk about it. Try to avoid saying, "It just takes time," or "Don't feel bad, he led such a full life." None of those remarks helps, the healing process.
Say this: "I heard about the death in your family. I can't imagine what this has been like for you."
Has lost their health: "Grief comes in waves," said Elizabeth Cohen, LCSW, coordinator of counseling services for Midwest Palliative & Hospice CareCenter. When someone has a chronic illness, be a presence and let the person know you are thinking of him. Gentle questions are fine; just take your cues from your guest.
Say this: "I'm free next Saturday afternoon. Is that a good time for me to come over to help you cook/shop/decorate?"

Full text: Funny how things always seem to have a way of working out, if you're patient enough. Earlier this fall, Diane and I made the long, costly drive to western Colorado to hunt elk with our boys. Not our first elk hunt. Although we planned this adventure down to the nth degree, nothing went according to the plan or the vision. Five of us hunted hard during the five-day elk season, but we came home meatless, with coolers stuffed with sleeping bags instead of backstraps.I know. I know. You don't measure hunts by the meat. Colorado is spectacular in early October and we never tire of its grandeur. Still, when you work hard and invest a lot of money and sweat, you like to have something tangible to show for it besides good memories. Or at least we do.
As the elk trip's head packer and planner, who was forced to make some tough, last-minute decisions about hunt areas and camping locations, I came home second guessing myself and, frankly, feeling a tad melancholy. Maybe I could have done better?
Like Maine, Colorado experienced a brutal winter with record-depth snow packs that may have taken its toll of elk, though state wildlife biologists have yet to concede this.
My lament was short-lived though. Son Josh, who wasn't on the elk trip, invited me to share the opening day of the Maine deer season with him in his neck of the woods. He had a plan. It sounded like a good one. We were to paddle our way up this long, boggy dead water at first light and spend the morning still hunting a hardwood ridge that skirted the bog.
What I liked about the plan was the idea that we might be able to get in a good position quickly with minimal noise and scent. The hope was that other hunters coming toward us from the roads might move some deer. We made it to the "take out," stashed our canoe and headed out in opposite directions. Josh was right. It was prime deer country with giant oaks, lots of acorns, and bedding areas nearby.
About 8 a.m., I took a break, boiled some tea, and sat for a time in some hardwoods. Above my head, protruding from the old dead ash I was resting against, was the biggest gaggle of fresh oyster mushrooms I'd ever seen. I picked them all, placed them in a Ziplok bag, and buried them in my day pack. "Wiggie Robinson would go bananas over this find," I thought to myself. My late friend, a true hunter-gatherer and a lover of wild mushrooms, taught me just enough about wild fungi to be dangerous. But I share my late friend's passion for oyster mushrooms butter-fried in a skillet with some venison backstraps.
About an hour later, as I worked my way into the freshening wind toward Josh's likely position, the thick hardwoods opened up some next to a small brook. On the other side of the brook there was a long plateau that was studded with some of the largest, old-growth oaks I have seen in years.
"Nice funnel for deer," I told myself. "Good place to linger for a while."
At this moment, unknown to me, Josh was a couple hundred yards below me watching the flickerings of two deer at a good distance through his glasses. Before he could get them in his scope, the doe split off toward the bog and the buck, on cue, trotted in the opposite direction downwind and up the higher ground in my direction.
Josh later told me that about 10 seconds after he saw the deer he heard the one Kapoom! of what he thought might be my .270.
"Would that be you, dad?" he queried on the hand-held radio.
"Yes, that would be me, Josh," I came back with a smile in my tone. "A plump 6 pointer."
"Alright! Way to go, Dad," Josh exclaimed over the radio. "I'll be right there."
Checking out my kill, Josh seemed happier than I was. Not only had his dad performed a make-good on the elkless elk hunt, the bog hunt was one of those plans that actually did come together! We high-fived and he kissed me on the cheek.
"What the heck are those white things in the plastic bag in your pack?" Josh asked, as I honed the blade on my knife.
"Mushrooms, my boy. Hand-picked wild oyster mushrooms." I said matter of factly." I always try to pick a few before I shoot my deer."

Making mix discs for your creeptastic party? Pick from our Halloween 50

Abstract: Please allow him to introduce himself. Frankly, you could put together an entire box set of songs devoted to Beelzebub. Suggestions: Van Halen's "Runnin' with the Devil," INXS' "Devil Inside," the Charlie Daniels Band's "The Devil Went Down to Georgia," the B-52's "Devil in My Car" and Mitch Ryder's "Devil in a Blue Dress." We'd also toss in Robert Johnson's "Hellhounds on My Trail" as a corollary, but you can't really dance to it. For thematic thrust plus dark delight, however, nothing beats the Stones' woo-hoo-ing classic. (From "Beggars Banquet," 1968)'Burn the Witch,' Queens of the Stone Age The wall-bending, witching-hour delirium of "The Gloaming" is a close second, and probably works better as background noise. But this one arrived before it, and its sense of obsession is still harrowing. "If you get too far inside you'll only see my reflection," Thom Yorke tells us. "So lock the kids up safe tonight / Shut the eyes in the cupboard/I've got the smell of a local man/Who's got the loneliest fear." Watch out! Other fine Radiohead picks, depending on your mood: "Pyramid Song," "The National Anthem," "Exit Music (For a Film)," "Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box," "Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors," "I Might Be Wrong," "Sit Down. Stand Up" (especially how Yorke sings "the raindrops! the raindrops!") and "We Suck Young Blood." (From "OK Computer," 1997)"Ghouls," HorrorPops There are so many selections from the spooky Queen of Goth, it's almost insulting to limit her and the Banshees to just one. For something harsher, seek out either "Night Shift" or "Voodoo Dolly" in their scorched live incarnations on "Nocturne" (1983). For something more playful, dig out the loopy loonies of "Happy House" or the party groove "Peek-a-Boo." For more atmosphere, try "Slowdive" or "Face to Face" (from "Showgirls," of all things) or, natch, "Halloween." But for something that combines all of those moods then adds galloping forcefulness, stay entranced by the "rag doll dance" of this rush of blood to the head. A true thriller. (From "Juju," 1981)"I Am Stretched on Your Grave," Sinead O'Connor

Full text: The first thing you'll realize is that we're liars: There are way more than 50 songs contained on our three lists - one of perennial classics, one filled with rock staples and a final 20 comprised of offbeat and lesser-known gems. Plenty of other selections have been drizzled like blood from an unhealed wound into these blurbs. You could easily patch together a wide enough web of fiendish delights to last your Halloween bash all night.
Some overplayed hits, like "Thriller" and "Dead Man's Party," we simply couldn't refuse. Others, like "Monster Mash" and "Ghostbusters," we've relegated to the kids' party to make room for the likes of Rob Zombie and Rihanna. Download 'em all (we've indicated what albums you can find them on, but iTunes has the overwhelming majority for individual sale), load up your MP3 player of choice, hit shuffle ... and let the spooking begin.'Bela Lugosi's Dead,' Bauhaus
If there's a quintessential spooky song for All Hallow's Eve, it has to be this nearly 10-minute, grimly fiendish epic about the most famous portrayer of Transylvania's blood-lusting count. The first half, all dubbed-out click-clack confusion complemented by Daniel Ash's squalls of noise, can still creep newcomers out. The second half, filled with Peter Murphy's cries of "undead, undead, undead!," is like giving yourself over to a vampire's kiss. A must, to be played VERY loudly. (From the compilation "Crackle," 1998)'Disturbia, Rihanna
A newbie to the list, this dark 'n' bumpin' track has fast become a party essential. The music video, featuring zombie-like dancers jerking and jiving, is reminiscent of Jacko's "Thriller." Who knows if the song will spawn its own specially choreographed dance, but it's definitely a track scantily costumed ladies will groove to on Halloween night. (From "Good Girl Gone Bad," 2007)'Dead Man's Party,' Oingo Boingo
Come on, you know the lyrics: "It's a dead man's party, who could ask for more? Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door." Danny Elfman's middle name should be "Halloween." Up until the band retired in 1995 its annual Halloween shows were insanely popular, but the spirit of Boingo lives on year after year as radio stations and record stores across the country play the heck out of this. (From "Dead Man's Party," 1985)'(Don't Fear) The Reaper, Blue Oyster Cult
All right, so it might have lost a little of its spookiness when Christopher Walken demanded "more cowbell" as Will Ferrell jiggled his belly fat in a "Saturday Night Live" sketch about this. But the song is still perfectly chilling. Beware, though: Horror flicks often use it to set the mood while two unsuspecting teenagers are getting it on. Then they get killed. (From "Agents of Fortune," 1976)'I Put a Spell on You,' Screamin' Jay Hawkins
Creedence Clearwater Revival's cover is perfectly acceptable as well, but Hawkins' signature song is best heard from the crazed, skull-cane-toting voodoo huckster himself. CCR's is for grooving; Hawkins' version is for giving you the willies while cracking you up. (From the compilation "Cow Fingers & Mosquito Pie," 1991)'Dragula,' Rob Zombie
All hail the new king of horror cinema. Zombie's "Dragula" is a high-energy, bloodthirsty track with a hard-driving chorus: "DIG through the ditches and BURN through the witches/I SLAM in the back of my ... DRAGULA!" Of course, you could do an entire disc of Zombie's solo stuff as well as White Zombie songs, from "Living Dead Girl" to "I'm Your Boogieman" - all Halloween-appropriate. As a bonus, throw on one of his films as background ("The Devil's Rejects" is the best by far) or the soundtracks to both that flick or "House of 1,000 Corpses." Easy choices for extra eerie sounds. (From "Hellbilly Deluxe," 1998)'The Killing Moon, Echo and the Bunnymen
A less obvious (and arguably more sensual) choice would be "Nocturnal Me," from the same album as this track. But "Moon," which a whole new generation seemed to discover (alongside Tears for Fears' "Mad World") thanks to its use in "Donnie Darko," is a gorgeous gothic-romantic masterpiece that only sounds richer as the years go by. (From "Ocean Rain," 1984)'People Are Strange,' the Doors
Even more appropriate for Halloween '08 is the title track of the album it comes from, but how can you refuse it? You also could substitute Echo and the Bunnymen's version from "The Lost Boys," but why? Jim Morrison's vocal on the original is much richer, and Ray Manzarek's much-mimicked tacked-piano feel (Danny Elfman, say thank you) is as playfully ghostly as ever. To add sheer terror, place Morrison's howl of poetry reading "Horse Latitudes" just before it. (From "Strange Days," 1968)'Thriller, Michael Jackson
Well, short of "Monster Mash" it is just about the most recognizable Halloween song the world over. Expertly crafted hokum it may be, but slip it on in the thick of your bash and watch - half the room if not more will spontaneously break into the video's dance sequence. If you've got serious cash, hire a local choreographer to teach it to your guests. (From "Thriller," 1982)'Psycho Killer, Talking Heads
Qu'est-ce que c'est? David Byrne's vivid portrayal of the sort of title character that became a national phenomenon at the time the song first appeared (when the Son of Sam was terrorizing NYC) still retains stark power and an ability to unnerve. Because of that, the original version is probably preferable - but for parties, try the slightly more beat-driven rendition on 1984's "Stop Making Sense." Also fun: "Stay Up Late." Even weirder: "Drugs (Electricity)." (From "Talking Heads 77," 1977)'Superstition, Stevie Wonder
As funky as hell is hot. But the best part of it is how Stevie weaves in so many superstitions into such a short space of words: "Thirteen-month-old baby broke the looking glass/Seven years of bad luck/Good things in your past." Stevie Ray Vaughan's smokin' remake is also acceptable. (From "Talking Book," 1972)'Halloween Theme,' John Carpenter
Bernard Herrmann's strings-slashing theme from "Psycho" is probably more recognizable, Mike Oldfield's "Tubular Bells" (aka the theme from "The Exorcist") possibly more creepy. You should have 'em all on your mix discs, and maybe leave room for "Jaws," too. But if you can only fit one, go with Michael Myers' ominous instrumental motif. (From "Halloween: Original Soundtrack," 1978)'The Time Warp,' from 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'
You remember. It's just a jump to the left, and then a step to the ri-i-i-eee-i-i-ight. With your hands on your hip, you bring your knees in tight. But, you know, it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insaa-eee-aaaa-eee-aaane. Add lyric-parodying gags as you see fit. (Best found on "The Rocky Horror Picture Show: 25 Years of Absolute Pleasure," 2000)'Werewolves of London, Warren Zevon
In which the title characters go hunting for beef chow mein, drink pina coladas at Trader Vic's and run amok in Kent - ahhh-wooooo indeed. Picturesque nuttiness from the late, great singer-songwriter that never gets old at Halloween. (From "Excitable Boy," 1978)'Welcome to My Nightmare, Alice Cooper
On second thought, "Dead Babies" or "Billion Dollar Babies" or "Is It My Body" or "Cold Ethyl" or "Sick Things" or even the positively silly "Feed My Frankenstein" would be cooler than Coop's most obvious fright-night staple, which is now a fairly moldy piece of cheese. Still, you can't avoid it. (From "Welcome to My Nightmare," 1975)Heavy Halloween
Fifteen favorites to help you bang your head while frightening trick-or-treaters:'Bad Moon Rising,' Creedence Clearwater Revival
Stephen King used it for foreshadowing in "The Shining," then ended "Silver Bullet" with it. Bands from Social Distortion and Rancid to Type O Negative and Rasputina have covered it. It's not terribly scary, of course. But despite its seemingly chipper exterior, it's sense of foreboding runs deep. (From "Green River," 1969)'Bark at the Moon, Ozzy Osbourne
There's at least a disc's worth of Black Sabbath songs you could include, and more than a few other Ozzy solo cuts. Yet everything about this charging rocker screams Halloween, from its silence-shattering opening to its grave-digging lyrics to its howling finish. (From "Bark at the Moon," 1983)'Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen, Santana
True, as with "Evil Ways," this one seems to be on the radio every half-hour. But how can it be denied? (From "Abraxas," 1970)'Helter Skelter, the Beatles
"I've got blisters on me fingers!" The opening guitar salvo still sends chills, McCartney has never seemed so possessed, and the droning stomp toward the fadeout is still so hypnotizing, it's not hard to see why Charles Manson thought he heard secret messages. For further hair-raising chills, add in Siouxsie and the Banshees' version. (From "The Beatles," 1968)'Hells Bells,' AC/DC
"Highway to Hell" fits, too, but the tolling title sound of this heavy-metal staple will, as the song says, "give you black sensations up and down your spine." Were it not for the Stones selection below, this would be Satan's anthem. (From "Back in Black," 1980)'Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me, U2
OK, so it's not really very scary sounding, more hyper-dramatic. Still, it's mood that matters, and Bono has rarely sounded so over-the-top - and the near-operatic music matches. (From "The Best of 1990-2000," 2002)'Lucifer Sam, Pink Floyd
"That cat's something I can't explain." A bit of Syd Barrett's surrealism always goes down unsettlingly this time of year, and this ode to the familiar that follows witch Jennifer Gentle around is one of the late drug-damaged madman's finest. The ghoulish, descending-into-darkness riff, like "Batman" on acid, will prick up ears that haven't heard it for sure. (From "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn," 1967)'Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), David Bowie
The title kinda says it all. There are plenty of other Bowie selections to fill up your soundtrack, from spooky ("Warszawa") to rockin' ("The Jean Genie") to downright loopy ("TVC15"). But with party tunes, sometimes it's better to be obvious. (From "Scary Monsters," 1980)'Frankenstein,' the Edgar Winter Group
Duh-duh dunn-dunn da-dunn-dunn-dahhh. Need we say more? (From "They Only Come Out at Night," 1972)'Strange Brew, Cream
"Kill what's inside of you." Another haunted rocker centered on another witchy woman. Play it before or after the Eagles track below. (From "Disraeli Gears," 1967)'Sympathy for the Devil, Rolling Stones
Please allow him to introduce himself. Frankly, you could put together an entire box set of songs devoted to Beelzebub. Suggestions: Van Halen's "Runnin' with the Devil," INXS' "Devil Inside," the Charlie Daniels Band's "The Devil Went Down to Georgia," the B-52's "Devil in My Car" and Mitch Ryder's "Devil in a Blue Dress." We'd also toss in Robert Johnson's "Hellhounds on My Trail" as a corollary, but you can't really dance to it. For thematic thrust plus dark delight, however, nothing beats the Stones' woo-hoo-ing classic. (From "Beggars Banquet," 1968)'Burn the Witch,' Queens of the Stone Age
Josh Homme & Co.'s "Hangin' Tree" and "Into the Hollow" are also worth considering, but we'll take this fiery stomper about mob rule. "The first to speak is the first to lie/The children cross their hearts and hope to die." Dread-filled ... yet sexy! (From "Lullabies to Paralyze," 2005)'Witch Hunt,' Rush
Part of the Canadian trio's "Fear Trilogy," this menacing third piece actually came first, followed by second part "The Weapon" (on 1982's "Signals") and first installment "The Enemy Within" (on 1984's "Grace Under Pressure"). In 2002, Rush added a fourth part, "Freeze," but stick to the darker original. Eerie fact: the mob noise in the opening moments was recorded the night John Lennon was killed. (From "Moving Pictures," 1979)'Witchy Woman, Eagles
"See how high she flies," and then take note of her other freakish characteristics: "Sparks fly from her fingertips," "she got the moon in her eye," "she can rock you in the nighttime till your skin turns red." Well, OK, that last one doesn't sound so bad. Still ... watch out. (From "Eagles," 1972)'Zombie, Cranberries
It's actually about the killing of two boys in an IRA bombing in Northwest England. But when Dolores O'Riordan cries out "zombie! zombie! zombie-yuh-ah-yuh-ah!" for the umpteenth time, your party guests probably won't be thinking about that. (From "No Need to Argue," 1994)The darker side of Halloween
Not all spooky songs need be so obvious. Here are 20 offbeat, lesser-known and darker-edged drops of musical blood to savor.'Candlelight Song, Violent Femmes
Creeeeeepy. Amid freaky, burbling sound effects Gordon Gano tones down the nasality, coos like a little boy and sounds as if he's going slightly mad ... until he tells you that his doll is dead ... then you KNOW he's bound for a padded cell. For a different sort of murderous madness, also include the Femmes harrowing "Country Death Song," in which a possessed father pushes his daughter down a well. Good choice to play after "Candlelight"? XTC's "Scarecrow People," who inhabit a far-off land with sociopolitical troubles eerily similar to our own. (From "The Blind Leading the Naked," 1986)"Die, Die My Darling," Misfits
Would it be Halloween without at least one Misfits song? Just look at these dudes - they were destined to play Halloween parties and drink blood on stage. And what hopeless romantics they are, considering lyrics like, "Don't cry to me, oh baby/Your future's in an oblong box." This serial killer classic just begs to be moshed to by over-testosteroned bros. Also consider: "Astro Zombies," "Devil's Whorehouse," "Dig up Her Bones" or, for the nostalgic, their version of "Monster Mash." (From "Misfits," 1991)"Cemetery Polka," Tom Waits
There are so many choices from the frog-voiced cult hero. His rendition of "Heigh-Ho (The Dwarfs Marching Song)" from the Disney tribute "Stay Awake" is as dark as a mine ride to hell with the lights out. "Underground" packs both stalker menace and sinister invitation, and "Earth Died Screaming" is self-explanatory. But this off-kilter track, a litany of dead relatives in just under two minutes, will surprise and unsettle your guests. (From "Rain Dogs," 1985)"Climbing up the Walls," Radiohead
The wall-bending, witching-hour delirium of "The Gloaming" is a close second, and probably works better as background noise. But this one arrived before it, and its sense of obsession is still harrowing. "If you get too far inside you'll only see my reflection," Thom Yorke tells us. "So lock the kids up safe tonight / Shut the eyes in the cupboard/I've got the smell of a local man/Who's got the loneliest fear." Watch out! Other fine Radiohead picks, depending on your mood: "Pyramid Song," "The National Anthem," "Exit Music (For a Film)," "Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box," "Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors," "I Might Be Wrong," "Sit Down. Stand Up" (especially how Yorke sings "the raindrops! the raindrops!") and "We Suck Young Blood." (From "OK Computer," 1997)"Ghouls," HorrorPops
A prime example of the psychobilly trio's devil-may-care attitude, this cut is straightforward rock 'n' roll with a swingin' beat and fun lyrics: "It's like I'm the wife of Halloween / Hey! It's a horror movie theme." For more instrumental good times, the group's "HorrorBeach," parts one and two, is pretty spectacular. (From "Hell Yeah," 2004)"Dirty Creature," Split Enz
Our choice for filthy beasts from the ocean deep goes to the quirky, long-defunct Finn-brothers band out of New Zealand, if only because it's got a good beat and you can dance to it. Other suitable selections: "Swamp Thing" by the Chameleons and "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" by Dave Edmunds. (From "Time and Tide," 1982)"Down by the Water," PJ Harvey
"Working for the Man," from the same album, is another wicked pick; in it, an apocalypse-possessed serial killer prowls streets aiming to rid them of sin. But this tale of a woman drowning her daughter - why is anyone's guess - chills as much with its skeletal riff as its horrifying lyrical details or Leadbelly-revival coda ("Little fish big fish swimming in the water/Come back here, man, gimme my daughter"). Never fails to prick up ears. (From "To Bring You My Love," 1995)"Spellbound," Siouxsie and the Banshees
There are so many selections from the spooky Queen of Goth, it's almost insulting to limit her and the Banshees to just one. For something harsher, seek out either "Night Shift" or "Voodoo Dolly" in their scorched live incarnations on "Nocturne" (1983). For something more playful, dig out the loopy loonies of "Happy House" or the party groove "Peek-a-Boo." For more atmosphere, try "Slowdive" or "Face to Face" (from "Showgirls," of all things) or, natch, "Halloween." But for something that combines all of those moods then adds galloping forcefulness, stay entranced by the "rag doll dance" of this rush of blood to the head. A true thriller. (From "Juju," 1981)"I Am Stretched on Your Grave," Sinead O'Connor
"... and I'll lie there forever." Over a jittery hip-hop loop laced toward the end with jig-worthy fiddle, the Irishwoman with the angelic voice declares her undying love by waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting ... until "I smell of the earth and am worn by the weather ... with you in your cold grave, I cannot sleep warm." Poe would approve. (From "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got," 1990)"Rose of the Devil's Garden," Tiger Army
For those tortured zombies holding their hearts in their hands this Halloween, this sweet-yet-deadly track is just for you. Vocalist Nick 13 toys with his heart dangerously and refers to his love as the "black rose" (aw, how romantic). "Death is pure - life is not. So ask yourself, what do you want? As for me, well, I want you. So pick the black rose and let its thorns cut you." If you weren't already dead inside, your heart would pitter-patter. See also: "Annabel Lee" (from "Tiger Army II: Power of Moonlite"), a song ripped straight from the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe, and another haunting moment from this dark, emotionally charged trio. (From "Tiger Army III: Ghost Tigers Rise," 2004)"Goo Goo Muck," the Cramps
Others may prefer "I Was a Teenage Werewolf," for obvious reasons, and there's certainly no reason to fear (just duck) the goo goo muck. But Halloween isn't complete without a bout of the Cramps. Most anything off "Gravest Hits" will suffice. In a similar, albeit less campy, vein: the Damned's fanciful "Grimly Fiendish." (From "Psychedelic Jungle," 1981)"We Only Come Out at Night," the Smashing Pumpkins
Not explicitly about vampires, at least not as much as, say, Sting's "Moon Over Bourbon Street," inspired by Anne Rice's "Interview with the Vampire," or something vaguer (and creepier) like Radiohead's "We Suck Young Blood." But this bouncy ballad works better as a change of pace for a mix. Plus, the chorus is an easy sing-along. (From "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness," 1995)"Halloween," AFI
A rockin fun punk song from an EP cut way before the Bay Area band became a radio fixture with "Girl's Gone Grey." So what if it's a Misfits cover? Davey and Jade do it better. (From "All Hallows Eve," 1999)"Haunted When the Minutes Drag," Love and Rockets
Everything seems to remind them of the love they lost, or whatever foul spirit three-fourths of Bauhaus can't seem to boot from their abode. "Haunted by your soul, by your hair, by your clothes, by your eyes, by your voice, by your smile, by your mouth." Yeah, that about covers it. (From "Seventh Dream of a Teenage Heaven," 1985)"Life Is a Grave & I Dig It," Nekromantix
Pretty much any song by this rockabilly trio could be used in a stellar Halloween mix, but this catchy track will surely inspire some dancing. With lyrics about monsters, vampires, graveyards and death in general, the band aims for darkness. To spice up a party, also throw on the Nekro's "Horny in a Hearse" - not for kids, obviously. (From "Life Is a Grave & I Dig It," 2007)"Pet Sematary," Ramones
Essential to any Halloween punk mix. Recorded for the 1989 adaptation of Stephen King's creepy novel of the same title, it became one of the band's better-known radio hits - a little cheesy, sure, but still a staple to sing along to. (From "Brain Drain," 1989)"Red Right Hand," Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds
You probably know this atmospheric nightmare of sinister strangers and creeping doom even if you think you don't. It's been used in "The X-Files," all three "Scream" films - and is said to have inspired "Hellboy." Of course, it's only one of dozens of Cave songs that could spook up your holiday. For starters, try most anything off "Murder Ballads." (From "Let Love In," 1994)"This Could Be Love," Alkaline Trio
These three princes of darkness are known for their insatiable appetite for death and destruction, and there's no better example of that than this sweet tune with sing-song lyrics that read like a serial killer's guide to a night of fun: "Step one, slit my throat. Step two, play in my blood. Step three, cover me in dirty sheets and run laughing.""This Is Halloween," Marilyn Manson
Everything Manson touches is creepy - look what he did to Eurythmics "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)." When he got his hands on this song, from Tim Burton's cult classic "The Nightmare before Christmas," he managed to make it pretty creeptastic as well. The theatrical track, with lots of vocal inflection and character impressions (Manson does em all), is spooky yet magically appropriate. Now imagine Manson's black teeth and white-out eyes and try to get a good night's sleep. (From "Nightmare Revisited," 2008)"Walking with a Ghost," Tegan and Sara
Indie rockers rejoice, you're represented on this list! Although originally by the White Stripes (R.I.P.?), T&S version is far more enjoyable; super manic, it plays out very much like being trapped in a maze - which way to go? The repetitious "out of my mind" begins to make you think just that. Despite the obvious "ghost" reference, it's a haunting little tune and far from boring - you don't want party guests passing out before midnight, do you? (From "So Jealous," 2004)

Abstract: Oyster shells came out with every shovelful of earth dug from the excavation for the sewer across Court street, Auburn, for the Shoe and Leather block, Tuesday. Where did they come from? The matter will be left to Gus Dunn, archaeologist and historian of Court House Square.

The matter will be left to Gus Dunn, archaeologist and historian of Court House Square.

The Auburn-Lewiston Lions Club will initiate a drive for additional members during the remainder of October, it was announced during yesterday's dinner meeting at the clubrooms at Young's Corner, Auburn.
Bert Demers of Lewiston, chairman of the membership drive committee, outlined plans for the campaign. Speaker at the meeting was Ellwood Neal, Gorham funeral director, who spoke and showed color slides on his recent trip to Florida.
Wives of members arranged the supper under Chairman Gladys Dillingham of Auburn. Twenty-five persons attended the gathering.25 years ago, 1983
Failure to get a permit gummed up the Lewiston Knights of Columbus annual Tootsie Roll Drive in Auburn on Saturday, and solicitors were asked to pack their sweets until a permit could be obtained from City Hall.
Because the candy drive was scheduled to last only through the weekend, the police action melts this year's Tootsie Roll fund-raising effort by the group.
Auburn police asked members of the Lewiston Council 106 Knights of Columbus to stop soliciting shoppers at Cottle's and Foodtown at about 11 a.m. because they were violating city ordinances.
"It was just an oversight on our part." said Grand Knight Gerald Berube, who was overseeing the annual drive. He said his group didn't have a permit last year either and was not aware they needed one until informed by police Saturday.
Berube, saying he was in support of the law requiring a permit, said next year they will be sure to get permits.

What to buy at end-of-season sales to stay in style next summer

Full text: A penny saved while shopping now can be a penny earned toward a great wardrobe next year.
While fashion forecasters don't yet know all the trends for next spring and summer, shopping wisely at the end-of-summer sales at many department, mass-retail and boutique stores is a smart, easy (and fun) way to save money on clothes, shoes and accessories.
Susan Huston, wardrobe consultant and owner of Arlington, Texas-based Susan Huston Fashion Concepts, said she loves to buy something in late August, put it away and "forget" about it until next spring.
"When you pull it out next year, it's like you've been shopping for a lot less money," she said.
But how do you know what to buy that won't scream "SUMMER 2008!" a year from now?
We asked three fashion experts - Huston, Nordstrom fashion director Gregg Andrews and Today show style editor Bobbie Thomas - what to buy on sale now that might be in style again next spring and summer.
Note: Many (but not all) of the clothes, shoes and accessories listed below are actual sale merchandise; prices were as of Aug. 1.The trend: classic dresses
What the experts say: A classic dress is seasonless, Thomas said. Simple sheaths, traditional shifts or figure-flattering wrap dresses can be building blocks of a great personal wardrobe. Invest in a great dress in neutral colors - white, black, navy - she adds, and punch it up with one colorful accessory.
One caveat about dress-shopping from Andrews: "A lot of the dresses we saw this season were those extremely long 'maxi' dresses or 'day gowns,' and I think those have the potential of looking dated," he said. "Stick to dresses at traditional lengths, right at the kneecap, with clean silhouettes."
Our picks: Milly white cotton shift dress with navy trim and pockets, $126 (reg. $360), Neiman Marcus (see "where to shop" for more details); Enzo Angiolini "Serious" red patent slingback pumps, $94.95, Nordstrom; Kate Landry red patent leather billfold, $13.50 (reg. $30), Dillard's.The trend: Tie-dye/ombre
What the experts say: Tie-dye, or dip-dye, patterns popped up as a fun trend in casual wear this season, and it's safe to keep them in the closet for next spring, too, our experts said. You might want to stick with neutral hues, though, as we don't yet know what the popular color combinations will be next spring.
"We'll see dip-dye but in more classic, neutral colors and more earth tones," Thomas said.
Tie-dye's close cousin, ombre (French for "shaded" or "shadow") is that light-dark faded effect sneaking up on shoes, handbags, even evening wear for the fall, which is a good indication we'll see it in spring as well, Andrews said. Again, right now "avoid anything using too many colors ... or rainbows," he said.
Our picks: Nicole by Nicole Miller gold "Gossip Girl" tie-dye banded top (polyester-spandex), $44, J.C. Penney; Mix-It "Rinse" dark denim short, $14.99 (reg. $30), J.C. Penney; Bold Elements metallic earrings, $15 (reg. $20), J.C. Penney; metallic bangles, $1 each, Ruby; metallic chain necklace in gold, silver and pewter tones, $40, Ruby.The trend: color
What the experts say: "Color is a great way to transition seasons. Try adding colorful shoes and accessories to a fall or seasonless outfit," Andrews said.
Don't be afraid to try a color you never thought you might wear, especially if a piece is on sale. But as with any fad, just because one color - yellow, magenta - is on all the store shelves doesn't mean you should run out and buy it if it doesn't look quite right on you. "Avoid anything that has a 'trendy' color combination," Andrews said. "All of that turquoise and brown is going to look dated next summer. If you go into a yellow and gray combination, you run the risk of looking dated."
Remember, white is always a great "foundation" color, he added. You can't go wrong with a crisp white shirt, white denim or a white dress.
Our picks: Nancy Rose chartreuse silk "Klara" blouse with loop details at bottom, $130 (reg. $243), Hot Poppy Couture; Ralph Lauren 380 white jeans, $99 (reg. $398), Neiman Marcus; Shih by Stephanie Lin turquoise patent leather tote with metallic accents, $264.90 (reg. $398), Nordstrom; Patterned, wide bangle, $25, Ruby.The trend: tribal/ethnic prints
What the experts say: It's safe to say the whole safari-tribal-animal-ethnic print trend that was huge in stores this year will transition to next, Andrews said.
"Safari-inspired is very classic," he said. Stick to neutral tones such as khakis, tans and browns, he suggested.
Huston adds that it's hard to predict the future of some of the big "travel prints" in unusual colors that might be on sales racks now.
"When you think about prints, lean more toward classic," she advised.
Our picks: Sunny Leigh pleated brown "Moody Blues" polyester blouse with ruffle trim, $41.30 (reg. $59), Macy's; Sunny Leigh multicolor "Jungle Fever" cotton-silk skirt, $35.55 (reg. $79), Macy's; Franco Sarto brown-metallic slingback wedges, $99.95, Nordstrom; gold chain with brown stones and beads necklace, $40, Ruby; Amber beaded drop earrings, $25, Ruby.The trend: strappy sandals and fun flats
What the experts say: Shoe heights will continue to hit both highs (as in heels) and lows (as in flats). But it's hard to say how long Roman-inspired, gladiator sandals will stay in style, Huston said. Sticking with a traditional sandal with skinny to moderate-width straps might be a better investment.
"With anything too heavy or gladiator-looking, you do run the risk of looking a little dated next summer," Andrews said.
Our picks: Jeffrey Campbell brown leather sandals with fringe and metallic detailing, $79.97, Nordstrom; Cynthia Vincent "Laurie" chartreuse flat, $117.50 (reg. $235), April Lane; BCBG Max Azria "Ceren" white patent-straw ballet flat with metallic buckle, $99 (regularly $198), April Lane; Frye "Dolly" jeweled T-strap sandal, $99 (reg. $198), April Lane; Attilio Giusti Leombruni black patent wedge gladiator $139 (reg. $278), April Lane.The trend: metallic handbags
What the experts say: "You can't go wrong with metallic," Andrews said. "They're always going to look chic."
Purses now feature fewer trendy details and more functional features. Look for a whole new crop of bags with working buckles, oversize clasps, pockets and hinges, he said.
Our picks: Botkier silver hobo bag, $49.99, Target; Black leather tote with metallic "chain" braiding, $85, Ruby; Giani Bernini pearlized oyster leather satchel with front-pocket organizer, $45 (reg. $75), Macy's; Kate Landry black metallic wristlet with gold accents, $22.05 (reg. $49), Dillard's; Jessica McClintock bronze ombre clutch with rhinestone button detail, $36, Macy's.The trends: statement necklaces and bangle bracelets
What the experts say: "A statement necklace is great any year, any season," Thomas said, because there's no easier way to add a pop of color to an outfit than an eye-catching necklace. Slide on some arm candy, too, with a bright, colorful bangle. "Any of the bangle bracelets that we saw this season - in wood, bone, shell, acrylic, leather ... are always a way to add interest," Andrews said.
Our picks: Mix-It red shell necklace, $16.80 (reg. $24), J.C. Penney; Roxanne Assulin blue acrylic-rhinestone beads, $75 (reg. $215), Neiman Marcus; red and turquoise "cinnabar" etched bangles, $20 each and turquoise and black cloisonne bangle with flowers, $40, Ruby; silver necklace with acrylic rose and butterfly and turquoise stones, $40, Ruby.Where to shop

Abstract: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I have a special friend who has angioedema. What is it? It comes on all of a sudden, out of nowhere, with no warning. Her tongue swells, and her throat swells and closes up. She can't talk or swallow. People have to call 911 for her. Help. - B.B. ANSWER: Angioedema is the sudden onset of swelling around the eyes, in the lips or tongue, in the throat, in the larynx (voice box), in the digestive tract or in all these places. "Angio" refers to blood vessels, and "edema" to swelling. A sudden release of cell chemicals like histamine makes blood vessels leak fluid in the tissues beneath the skin. Throat and tongue swelling can cut off airflow into the lungs and threaten life. Allergies can be food allergies, and shellfish, milk, nuts, eggs, wheat and soy are the most common offenders. Your friend has to carefully go over everything she did or ate prior to a reaction. ACE-inhibitors - popular blood pressure medicines - bring an attack of angioedema to some people. Lotensin, captopril, Vasotec, Lisinopril, Prinivil, Monopril, Zestril, Accupril, Altace and Mavik are examples. Other medicines involved in angioedema are aspirin, NSAIDs - nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Aleve, Advil, Motrin - and birth-control pills.

ANSWER: Angioedema is the sudden onset of swelling around the eyes, in the lips or tongue, in the throat, in the larynx (voice box), in the digestive tract or in all these places. "Angio" refers to blood vessels, and "edema" to swelling. A sudden release of cell chemicals like histamine makes blood vessels leak fluid in the tissues beneath the skin. Throat and tongue swelling can cut off airflow into the lungs and threaten life.
For about 40 percent of those with angioedema, a triggering cause can't be found.
For the other 60 percent, the causes include allergies, medicines, hidden illnesses and even such things as cold or hot weather or sunlight.
Allergies can be food allergies, and shellfish, milk, nuts, eggs, wheat and soy are the most common offenders. Your friend has to carefully go over everything she did or ate prior to a reaction. ACE-inhibitors - popular blood pressure medicines - bring an attack of angioedema to some people. Lotensin, captopril, Vasotec, Lisinopril, Prinivil, Monopril, Zestril, Accupril, Altace and Mavik are examples. Other medicines involved in angioedema are aspirin, NSAIDs - nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Aleve, Advil, Motrin - and birth-control pills.
Hidden illnesses can be responsible for attacks. Lymphoma - lymph node cancer - is an example. Sometimes inherited conditions are the reason for these episodes.
If no cause is found for your friend's angioedema, then she might have to take daily antihistamines to prevent recurrences, or carry a syringe prefilled with medicine that can put a quick end to an attack.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I have had chronic lymphocytic leukemia for at least 13 years. When the white blood cell count is high, my doctor puts me on prednisone. When I am on a prednisone cycle, I feel as if 10 years have been removed from my body. I feel so good that I even think longingly about women. (I am 81-plus.) What would be wrong with a steady, small dose of prednisone if it has such a positive effect on my well-being? - L.S.
ANSWER: Prednisone is one of the cortisone drugs. It often induces euphoria and a sense of rejuvenation. Long-term use, even of small doses, of cortisone drugs can weaken bones and muscles, raise blood sugar, thin skin, encourage infections and suppress the adrenal gland. The dangers of long-term use far outweigh the benefits.
Some illnesses, however, do call for lengthy use, and in those cases the dangers of cortisone complications are worth the benefit of keeping an illness controlled.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I finally made it to 90 years last month and I am proud to say that at this age, I don't have to take any prescription medicines or any over-the-counter stuff. So, having no medical problems plaguing me, why am I writing you?
I have a different kind of medical question. When your doctor comes into the examining room carrying your folder with your medical history, how much does he remember about you at that time, and how much can he learn about you by scanning through the folder in the few minutes he spends with you? - F.V.
ANSWER: A 90-year-old in such good shape and on no medicines leaves a lasting impression, and a brief glimpse at his chart would be all it takes to remember everything about that person.
You do make a good point. The doctor should familiarize himself or herself with the chart before entering the room. Most patients have complicated medical histories, and no one can remember the details without spending some undisturbed time refreshing memories.
Doctors, take note. F.V. is watching you.
Dr. Donohue regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but he will incorporate them in his column whenever possible. Readers may write him or request an order form of available health newsletters at P.O. Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Readers may also order health newsletters from www.rbmamall.com

Abstract: Decades earlier, the Lewiston-Auburn area had abundant opportunities for its residents to relax and enjoy some well-earned time off. There were several developments known in the late 1800s and early 1900s as trolley car theaters and pleasure spots. They were sort of the theme park of the time. While the rich and famous of the Victorian era were arriving at Lewiston's Grand Truck Railway terminal to take the stagecoaches to the luxurious Poland Spring Hotel, local folks were flocking to Lake Grove in Auburn and Island Park in Lewiston. The Lewiston-Auburn Horse Railroad Company was organized more than a century ago with $100,000 put up by two men from New York and two from Massachusetts. The first tracks went from the head of Lisbon Street to the fairgrounds, and across the river to the Perryville neighborhood of Auburn where the railroad overpass crosses Turner Street and a bit beyond.

Full text: Today's gas prices have a lot of people talking about a "staycation." Years ago, members of most families never thought they had to get away. They found their amusement much closer to home.The idea of an annual vacation in the summer is a fairly recent custom.
Probably the end of World War II marks the time when ordinary people were finding that five-day work weeks, cars in every family, and the increasing availability of air travel were making vacations possible for the average family.
Decades earlier, the Lewiston-Auburn area had abundant opportunities for its residents to relax and enjoy some well-earned time off. There were several developments known in the late 1800s and early 1900s as trolley car theaters and pleasure spots. They were sort of the theme park of the time.
The following are accounts I found in the research notes of my aunt, Edith Labbie, who wrote extensively for the Lewiston Evening Journal's weekly magazine.
While the rich and famous of the Victorian era were arriving at Lewiston's Grand Truck Railway terminal to take the stagecoaches to the luxurious Poland Spring Hotel, local folks were flocking to Lake Grove in Auburn and Island Park in Lewiston.
It was the development of the local "horse cars" and later the electric trolleys that led to these early amusement parks. To enhance business, the trolley companies needed to have a popular destination - build it and they will come.
The Lewiston-Auburn Horse Railroad Company was organized more than a century ago with $100,000 put up by two men from New York and two from Massachusetts. The first tracks went from the head of Lisbon Street to the fairgrounds, and across the river to the Perryville neighborhood of Auburn where the railroad overpass crosses Turner Street and a bit beyond.
Eventually, the horse cars and then electrics went all the way to Lake Auburn where the trolley company had built the Lake Grove amusement area.
It was filled on summer nights with residents of the Twin Cities out for a picnic or to see a show in the pavilion.
That area is now the site of a public boat launch.
The Lake Grove development was such a success that the trolley company built Island Garden on an island at the Lewiston side of the falls. A lease was signed with Union Water Power Company in 1890 and a steel suspension bridge was constructed with new electrical lighting as a special attraction.
They built a 200-seat theater on the island. There was another building for hawkers who sold novelty items and food, and a building where small wild animals were shown.
Programs at Island Garden changed weekly. There were plays as well as many oddities that included a visit by a remarkable horse with a mane 14 feet long, a forelock 10 feet long and a tail of 12 feet.
One year when rains had swollen the flow of the Androscoggin, a play was scheduled but the bridge was swaying wildly above the water. The actors decided to go ahead with the play, and patrons were loyal enough to cross the bridge without incident.
It was the speed, economy and ease of new electric trolleys to Lake Grove at East Auburn that spelled the end for Island Garden. In 1903, Casco Castle was built at South Freeport and the bridge was sold and moved there.
A fire destroyed Casco Castle soon after it opened and the bridge was lost in the blaze.
With trolley travel available, more amusement areas appeared. There was Frost Park at the homestead of George D. Frost atop a hill in Lisbon Falls. It had a dining room for 40 and a large dancing pavilion. Each had huge stone fireplaces. A full-course dinner was 50 cents and lobsters were 25 cents each in the earliest days.
There also was an amphitheater for plays, benches with river and mountain views, and swings with three seats suspended from 100-foot trees.
It was a great place for political speeches and annual picnics of local companies and organizations. One 1924 outing by United Commercial Travelers of L-A included a Cundys Harbor clam bake and return to Frost Park for games, songs and dancing. There were stocking-foot races, a fat man's contest, nail-driving contest, tug-of-war and three-legged race.
Also described was a tub race across the dance floor. Three people with brooms for oars propelled the tubs across the pavilion.
There was a baked bean supper, and the day ended with an oyster stew.
All this came to an end when Frost Park's pavilion caved in during the winter of 1926.
While the wealthy may have spent their entire summers at Poland Spring and Bar Harbor, there was no shortage of ways for the ordinary families of L-A to find plenty of fun not far from home.

Abstract: "Right now, oil companies are sitting on 68 million acres, an area approximately three times the size of Maine," Congressman Tom Allen said through a spokesman. "They need to drill on land they already control. Oil and gas development in the Gulf of Maine would threaten Maine's thriving coastal economy and rich fishing heritage." [Lew Incze]'s census doesn't take a stand on drilling: "It's really quite dangerous to mix science and advocacy," he said. From a geological point of view, Georges Bank off Maine's coast is similar to the Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia, where quite a bit of natural gas has been discovered. "It's certainly the most diverse area on the U.S. East Coast. It has a lot of attraction from that standpoint, whether it's people living here or people traveling here," he said. "If that's a big key to our economic future, you better protect it."

Full text: More than anyone thought. Considered one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, experts urge caution when it comes to oil drilling and other threats.
Not so long ago, no one knew exactly what lived in the Gulf of Maine.
So Lew Incze, a Lewiston native, helped find out.
Chief scientist and local head of the international Census of Marine Life, his group counted 3,317 species living in the Gulf of Maine. He suspects there are hundreds if not thousands left to discover.
It's a major undertaking, the ongoing census of marine life in the Gulf, and far from the only project dedicated to the thousands of miles of ocean between Nova Scotia and Massachusetts. As a natural resource, a recreational resource and an economic driving force, the Gulf of Maine is getting a lot of attention of late.
President Bush recently lifted the ban to drill for oil in the Gulf of Maine. A Maine company is floating a proposal to stick 1,000 windmills up to 20 miles offshore and draw power from its sea breeze. The Gulf of Maine Research Institute has 30 ongoing projects. One that's already wrapped up looked at how cod swim when they're tired. (It's different than tired haddock.)
It's a hub of activity, a spot some people say to keep an eye on. The Gulf of Maine could weigh heavily in Maine's future.
The chief technology officer behind the windmill project estimates the creation of 5,000 to 10,000 jobs if that project takes off. And with the rise of the middle class in India and China, GMRI President Don Perkins can see fish turning into a luxury protein that commands four to five times the price it does now.
"What do we have (that will allow us) to compete with the rest of the world?" Perkins asked. He'd answer, the Gulf.
"It's not something that's going to migrate to South Carolina because the cost of labor is cheaper down there."Gulf health: a snapshot
Sea life in the Gulf ranges in size from the endangered 100-plus-ton right whale to the teeny copepods that the right whale eats by the billions each day.
As deep as 1,500 feet in spots, according to the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System, the Gulf is home to 52 species of commercially harvested fish and shellfish. Lobster is by far the biggest crop with a catch valued at $270 million last year, more than half of the estimated half-billion-dollar fishing economy in Maine.
"The resource is really, really healthy," said Dane Somers, executive director of the Maine Lobster Promotion Council.
And that's despite decade-long predictions of an impending crash, Perkins said.
When scientists looked to see why lobster stocks had fared so well, preliminary data found 30 to 45 percent of a Gulf lobster's meat is a derivative of herring - a free lunch that's snatched from the bait bags set in lobster traps. (Lobsters don't try to catch live herring; it's too much work.) Turns out nearly all lobsters that end up in a trap find a way out, he said. That is, after a nourishing meal.
"We're basically running a lobster ranch at the bottom of the ocean," said Perkins.
He characterized the Gulf's lobster stock as great, herring as robust and mackerel as very abundant.
"Haddock have recovered in a very dramatic way, where cod haven't," Perkins said. And tuna is "struggling." He remains optimistic about chances for recovery, and the Gulf's fisheries in general.
"The ecosystem here is one of the 12 most productive ecosystems in the world," he said.
Incze, who started the marine census here in 2003 as one of the pilot sites for the international count, said there's a lot left to understand. For instance, why aren't some stocks rebounding. It's possible the genetic or species mix has been tipped too far to come back.
Dredging on the bottom during fishing is also a problem, he said. Some compare it to tilling a garden. Incze's not sure of the repercussions.
"All in all, the Gulf of Maine is doing pretty well. ... At this point in our history, we are doing things in virtually every spot in the ocean in the Gulf of Maine. Someone is fishing, someone is traveling, someone is trying to lay a cable or a pipeline or is transporting oil or is discharging ballast from a ship or wants to mine gravel or wants to grow salmon or mussels," Incze said.
"The question is, what's the right amount, and where, and how."To drill or not to drill
The specter of drilling for oil in the Gulf was raised anew July 14 when President Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling originally signed by his father in 1990. To happen, Congress has to also agree, so far an unlikely prospect. Members of Maine's congressional delegation all oppose drilling off the Gulf.
"Right now, oil companies are sitting on 68 million acres, an area approximately three times the size of Maine," Congressman Tom Allen said through a spokesman. "They need to drill on land they already control. Oil and gas development in the Gulf of Maine would threaten Maine's thriving coastal economy and rich fishing heritage."
Through a spokeswoman, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said she supports expanded exploration on federal lands in the Rocky Mountains, Gulf of Mexico and parts of Alaska already open to drilling - but not an expansion to the Gulf, citing fishing and tourism.
"We need to produce more, use less, and pursue alternatives," she added.
A push two years ago to let states decide for themselves whether or not to explore for oil and natural gas supplies 50 miles offshore died in Congress.
"What was a poor choice in 2006 is still a poor choice in 2008. We still can't drill our way out of this (energy) situation, which, we admit, is serious," said Dylan Voorhees, clean energy director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. "I feel relatively optimistic that good sense will prevail again. The economics are really not there. This will not make oil cheaper."
GMRI's Perkins said he has questions about the impact of oil drilling on critical fisheries habitat and the potential for seepage.
Incze's census doesn't take a stand on drilling: "It's really quite dangerous to mix science and advocacy," he said. From a geological point of view, Georges Bank off Maine's coast is similar to the Scotian Shelf off Nova Scotia, where quite a bit of natural gas has been discovered.
"It's still always a bit of a hit or miss as far as what types of reserves you hit. You can have the right geology (but) history just didn't deposit the right materials that would store a lot. So it's still quite an unknown," Incze said.
"Short of accidents, I suspect that you would find that it (drilling) doesn't have a major impact on marine life. It does have an impact. The whole idea behind ecosystem approaches to management is to try to figure out what impacts can you live with, and what can't you."Going where the wind blows
George Hart is pairing with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute to study the impact of 1,000 windmills on marine life and fishing.
The Ocean Energy Institute's plan: Five 200-turbine fields, each turbine one kilometer apart from the other, 16 to 20 miles out to sea. Each would produce, on average, 54,000 kilowatt-hours a day, sit on the top of a tethered 300-foot pedestal and have a generator and gear box two-thirds the size of a railroad box car, according to Hart, chief technology officer for the company.
The wind in the Gulf blows twice as fast in the winter, which he sees as having the potential to alleviate some of Maine's heating woes. Testing three turbine prototypes would take about $100 million, Hart said. Jobs would be created by keeping production and assembly in-state. He's talking to the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood Composite Center about the use of composites in the turbines.
To be determined: how well boats can navigate around them.
Perkins future plans for GMRI include building a marine technology wing at its Portland headquarters in the next three to five years, heavy with private industry researchers and with an aim of bringing products to market. He sees opportunity in the ocean for future pharmaceuticals.
The Gulf of Maine "is on a trajectory that I think is encouraging, except for the (big question) of climate change," Perkins said. Over the long run, the next hundred years or more, the ocean appears to be moving from slightly basic to slightly acidic. "It's a horrible specter."A gulf of unknowns
The Gulf, which stretches south to the tip of Cape Cod and east to Nova Scotia, takes up about as much space in the water as the state of Maine does on land. Incze said he was at a meeting with other scientists six or seven years ago when someone raised the question about the number of species living in it. The best guess around the room was 1,700.
The census found almost double that. "Most of those species were already known, it's just no one had pulled the information together," said Incze, who is also director of the Aquatic Systems Group at the University of Southern Maine.
So far, it's also found fewer than a dozen new species in the Gulf, both brand new and new to the area. As well-explored as the Gulf is, there's a whole lot more to learn, Incze said. The Census of Maine Life wraps in 2010.
"It's certainly the most diverse area on the U.S. East Coast. It has a lot of attraction from that standpoint, whether it's people living here or people traveling here," he said. "If that's a big key to our economic future, you better protect it."

Full text: More than 3,300 known species live in the Gulf of Maine, but some can't help but stand out.
Andy Pershing, a Gulf of Maine Research Institute scientist, ecosystem modeler and University of Maine assistant professor, helped narrow the pack and supplied information, along with other scientists.Biggest
Fin whale, second largest whale species at 50 to 70 tons
Numbers: Approximately 20,000 to 40,000 in the North Atlantic
Eat: Krill, herring, sand lance
Eaten by: Occasionally, killer whales in the Gulf (not common here, but have been seen)
Did you know? Nicknamed the Greyhound of the Sea, it can travel up to 23 mph (real greyhounds can run twice that).Smallest (seen with the naked eye)
Copepods, size of a piece of rice, at best
Numbers: Trillions and trillions
Eat: Phytoplankton, little paramecium
Eaten by: Larval cod and haddock, right whales (they consume a jaw-dropping, and jaw-filling, 700-plus-billion Calanus finmarchicus copepods a day)
DYK? The genus Calanus may be the most abundant multi-cellular organism on the planet.Most rare
Right whale
Numbers: Fewer than 400 in the North Atlantic
Eats: Copepods, krill
Eaten by: Rarely, large sharks and killer whales; more common is death by ship strike or entanglement
DYK? Named because they were the "right whale" to hunt; unlike lots of other whales, their dead float.Biggest shark
Basking shark, 20 to 30 feet, rarely up to 50
Numbers: Difficult to estimate; varies by year and amount of food
Eats: Zooplankton, copepods, filter food through their gills
Eaten by: Nada (as adults, very low mortality rate)
DYK? These big guys don't have teeth and like to laze around swimming on their sides, so you might not spot the fin.Biggest cash crop
Lobsters, $270 million catch last year
Numbers: Approximately 350-plus million
Eats: Anything, everything
Eaten by: People, cod, crab, other lobsters
DYK? The Maine Lobster Promotion Council has the largest database of lobster recipes (650) in the world. Five hundred are online.Most valuable groundfish crop (and ugliest Gulf dweller)
Monkfish, at $25 million a year
Numbers: Approximately 118,700 metric tons, over the target amount, meaning healthy stock
Eats: Anything, everything (waves a lure that's part of its dorsal fin to attract prey, then snaps its mouth shut on its unsuspecting meal)
Eaten by: Other monkfish, people, seals, sharks
DYK? They're amazing eaters. A 2.4-foot monkfish was once caught with a 2.2-foot cod intact inside its belly.Most dangerous
Red tide dinoflagellate, causes paralytic shellfish poisoning in humans who eat contaminated seafood
Numbers: Fluctuates. These single-cell algae have annual bloom cycles in March-April and August-September
Eats: Uses photosynthesis
Eaten by: Copepods, muscles, clams, scallops, sponges
DYK? Red tide occurs naturally, normally blooms offshore and in Georges Bank and doesn't become a problem until wind blows the surface water close. Also a bit of a misnomer; it very rarely turns the Gulf of Maine red.One you least want to meet
White shark, lots of teeth, not so friendly
Numbers: Difficult to estimate; varies by year and amount of food
Eats: Seals, large fish
Eaten by: Nada (as adults, very low mortality rate); like basking shark, federally protected from fishing
DYK? The first seal pup befriended by the man behind "Andre the Seal" was eaten by a white shark. A later pup became the famous one.Fastest
Bluefin tuna, can reach up to 50 mph
Numbers: Shrinking; it's critically endangered
Eats: herring, sand lance, mackerel, squid, eels
Eaten by: People (used for high-grade sushi), killer whales, sharks
DYK? It's warm-blooded. The Maine State Saltwater Angler Record: 1,155 pounds, caught in 1981 with a harpoon.

Abstract: They seem to think we all reside in white clapboard cottages, perched atop misty cliffs under tall pines facing the sea, and have peeling wooden rocking chairs on our porches, subsisting on a mixture of fresh-picked corn, wild berries and fish. That we take cherry red '52 Ford pick-ups to work every day, shop at farmers markets and pick up our fish at the seashore, bare-footed, dungarees rolled up to just below the knee, from our lobsterman friend Clyde, who wears bright yellow foul-weather gear and enters, stage right, to the intro of Billy Joel's "Downeaster Alexa." Sometimes, if the light's just right and the air's smelling faintly of manure (reminding them that they're deep in the country and in close proximity to at least one field), they'll still have that glint in their eye when it comes time for dinner. That's always when things go wrong. They are expecting a lobster shack, a clambake, a jaunt down to the beach to tear mussels from the rocks. You give them a good meal - better than decent - at one of the many nice spots in town. But they tend to leave with a confused, somewhat mournful look on their faces. No lobster bib. No fishy-smelling hands. No wet wipes. And when we get home, to an apartment that manages to lack an attached blueberry field, a maple sugar shack and a cow from which to obtain fresh cream, you can almost see the Maine mirage disappear before their eyes.

Full text: Every time out-of-state friends hear you live in "Maine," an almost imperceptible sigh is exhaled, as if from nowhere.
Then comes the expression of childlike wonder. The faraway glint in the eye. The friend will generally mutter something about having always loved Maine: its simplicity, its certainty, its rocky shores and drawn-out vowels, its blueberries and its delicate, exotic lobster.
They seem to think we all reside in white clapboard cottages, perched atop misty cliffs under tall pines facing the sea, and have peeling wooden rocking chairs on our porches, subsisting on a mixture of fresh-picked corn, wild berries and fish. That we take cherry red '52 Ford pick-ups to work every day, shop at farmers markets and pick up our fish at the seashore, bare-footed, dungarees rolled up to just below the knee, from our lobsterman friend Clyde, who wears bright yellow foul-weather gear and enters, stage right, to the intro of Billy Joel's "Downeaster Alexa."
It takes an almost-superhuman act of patience to disabuse them of this notion. So usually, you just wait for them to arrive, and find out for themselves.
They come to town and discover that it's a pretty place, but one that looks, much to their chagrin, a lot like any other town.
Sure, Lewiston's architecture tends toward the ancient and the picturesque (especially when viewed from one of the bridges, at night), the amusements toward the charmingly rustic: homemade ice cream, a walk or drive down by the misty lake, $8 movies and perhaps some mini golf, a tour of the newsroom or a visit to Kennedy Park.
Sometimes, if the light's just right and the air's smelling faintly of manure (reminding them that they're deep in the country and in close proximity to at least one field), they'll still have that glint in their eye when it comes time for dinner.
That's always when things go wrong. They are expecting a lobster shack, a clambake, a jaunt down to the beach to tear mussels from the rocks. You give them a good meal - better than decent - at one of the many nice spots in town. But they tend to leave with a confused, somewhat mournful look on their faces. No lobster bib. No fishy-smelling hands. No wet wipes. And when we get home, to an apartment that manages to lack an attached blueberry field, a maple sugar shack and a cow from which to obtain fresh cream, you can almost see the Maine mirage disappear before their eyes.
This was the sad story of my life - and yours, perhaps, as well. But something happened the other day that, in a way, solved my problem.
No, the Atlantic did not suddenly appear in my back yard. Nor was I gifted with a cow - or even a goat, although that would have been almost good enough.
It was actually my boss boss who told me about it: a lobster shack, deep in the wilds of Turner, with outdoor eating and fresh crustaceans. The effect, she said, was so close to that of a seaside shack that you could almost believe you were seated on some tropical beach, if you kept your back to the road.
Might I want to try it?
I brought an out-of-town friend there last weekend. The place is called the Village Farm and, just as Judy said, it very much resembled a Jamaican beach bar, minus the location.
I must say we went on a rather unfortunate day. It was extremely misty outside on the evening we made the trek, and the damp brought out the aroma of freshly applied manure in the air. I've been out that way many times before, and never smelled it. It was a fluke - a bad joke, but there was nothing I could do.
We also ordered wrong. We both got lobster rolls. There was a choice on the menu: lobster salad or clear meat which, we thought, would be more traditional.
We were surprised by what arrived at the table: perfectly delicious lobster, but plain, no mayonnaise or butter to hold it together. We ate it, enjoying the texture and taste of the shellfish, but were dismayed nevertheless. For some reason, we didn't ask our waitress about it. We were hungry, and preferred eating to questioning and waiting for another try.
The lobster itself was wonderful: a paragon of freshness.
The families seated all around us had made better choices: here a teenage boy, with red hair and lots of freckles, dug into a huge whole lobster with a maniacal grin on his face, there a woman ate a forkful of what looked to be golden-fried shrimp.
I looked up "clear meat" when I got home and found that, at least according to www.chow.com, the term tends to mean "no mayo." So, really, we got what we ordered: perfectly good, plain lobster.
I'll definitely go back, both for the atmosphere and the chance to order with a bit more information. Next time, I think I'll get an actual boiled lobster. Or maybe some fried shrimp. Or perhaps the lobster salad roll. Or...Tasty tidbits

Full text: Lewiston - Betty J. Giroux, 81, of 14 Shank St., in Lewiston, died unexpectedly Saturday afternoon, July 19, at Central Maine Medical Center with family at her side.
She was born in Columbia, Pa., Aug. 4, 1926, the daughter of Elmer and Ethel (Fox) Garber and was educated at Columbia High School in her hometown. On Nov. 23, 1946, she married Robert Giroux at Oyster Point in Lancaster, Pa. and they later settled in Lewiston to raise their family. She worked at Knapp Shoe for 23 years until her retirement. She was a member of East Auburn Baptist Church and for the last 20 years she volunteered countless hours at Central Maine Medical Center. She was also a member of Horizon 55, and in her free time enjoyed knitting many different items, but especially scarves. But what she enjoyed most of all was following, spending times with her friends, watching and enjoying the many various extracurricular activities that her children and grandchildren were involved in and special family times and get-togethers. She was a proud and heroic three-year survivor of breast cancer and will be greatly missed, but will always be remembered as a loving and devoted wife, mother and grandmother.
She leaves her husband of 61 years, Robert Giroux of Lewiston; two daughters, Donna Giroux of Lewiston and Brenda Pelletier and Tim Clough of Auburn; three sons, Michel Giroux, Ronald Giroux and Pam Guerin, Marcel Giroux and wife, Jeannie, all of Lewiston; six grandchildren, Jared, Keith, Colby, Mason Giroux and Audrey and Tyler Pelletier; sister-in-law, Rita Noonan of San Diego, Calif.: and former son-in-law, Richard (Jr.) Pelletier of Sabattus; two brothers, Richard Garber of Lancaster, Pa., and Robert Garber of Lebanon, Pa., and several nieces and nephews.
She was predeceased by a brother, James Garber of Spring City, Pa., who died in 1981.

Abstract: "We never had a team, and there were four or five right around us," [Bob Parlin] recalled. "We got all the families together. There was a lady who had nothing to do with it that wanted to know if we needed a place to play ball. We said, 'Sure,' and she said, 'Help yourself.' I knew a fellow in New Sharon. He had a grader, and he came up and graded out the field."Baseball in the blood "He would come home from work, grab a light lunch, and he would do that night after night," Parlin said. "Of course, back then you'd have probably one car go by. Traffic was no big thing." "I'd knock a board off the side of a partition and start down the road, batting those rocks into the woods," Lancaster said. "I'd never get back home with the board. It was always splintered. I believe that's how my wrists got so strong, batting rocks. There was nobody to play with out in the country. All I had were sisters."

Full text: FARMINGTON - Steve Lancaster's baseball journey granted him the opportunity to field fastballs from one Hall of Famer and chalk up a base hit against another.
Bob Parlin rarely left the diamonds of Franklin County, faithfully giving the youth in his village of Fairbanks the opportunity to dream about making it to Fenway Park or Cooperstown.
Those roads converge next month in Portland, when Parlin, 83, and Lancaster, 65, become the latest locals inducted into the Maine Baseball Hall of Fame.
"I got the call Christmas morning," said Lancaster, who grew up in Pittston and Fayette, graduating from Livermore Falls High School. "What a gift."
"It's something I don't have the words for. What a great honor." echoed Parlin.
The ceremony is scheduled for Sunday, Aug. 17 at Holiday Inn By the Bay.Power and glory
Lancaster, a brawny catcher and first baseman, became a town team legend in Maine and New Jersey for his tape-measure home runs.
That power and flair for the dramatic drew the attention of a scout from the Philadelphia Phillies. They signed Lancaster to a Class-A minor league contract in 1964.
"He was scouting a catcher of ours whose name was Dillon," said Lancaster, who played for the Burlington (N.J.) Giants in a semipro league while working in the Pennsylvania steel mills. "The first game, I got two homers, a double and a single in five at-bats, and I guess I got his attention."
One season and a possible promotion later, Lancaster was drafted into the Army. He was released by the Phillies after failing to arrive at spring training.
A World War II Navy veteran, the more compactly built Parlin cast an unlikely shadow at first base for the Temple Townies and legendary local skipper Larry Boyce.
Known to his teammates as "Lefty," Parlin found his true baseball calling in 1960, when he collaborated with Red Luce, Charlie Adams and Keith Alexander to launch a Little League team.
After an 0-14 season played in hand-me-down uniforms, Parlin guided more than a full generation of Fairbanks Red Sox to a record of 270-34 and 19 championships before his retirement in 1982.
"We never had a team, and there were four or five right around us," Parlin recalled. "We got all the families together. There was a lady who had nothing to do with it that wanted to know if we needed a place to play ball. We said, 'Sure,' and she said, 'Help yourself.' I knew a fellow in New Sharon. He had a grader, and he came up and graded out the field."Baseball in the blood
Although they grew up many miles apart and in different eras, Parlin and Lancaster each harbor fond memories of their formative years in the sport.
Parlin, a native of neighboring New Vineyard, would wear out a spot where the lawn met the road, shagging fly balls hit by his father, Millard.
"He would come home from work, grab a light lunch, and he would do that night after night," Parlin said. "Of course, back then you'd have probably one car go by. Traffic was no big thing."
There were fewer opportunities for neighborhood pickup games along the dead-end, dirt road where Lancaster first lived, in a farmhouse roughly five miles from Gardiner.
Solitude led Lancaster to dismantle brooms and any other implements he could unearth in the family's woodshed.
"I'd knock a board off the side of a partition and start down the road, batting those rocks into the woods," Lancaster said. "I'd never get back home with the board. It was always splintered. I believe that's how my wrists got so strong, batting rocks. There was nobody to play with out in the country. All I had were sisters."
No matter where the Lancaster family rested its heads at night, Lancaster was slugging home runs between dreams.
Twice, he shared in a Babe Ruth state championship with Augusta. His Winthrop American Legion squad also captured a state title. At 15, with nobody checking his birth certificate, Lancaster landed a spot in the heart of the lineup for Chisholm-Livermore's entry in the Pine Tree League.
Lancaster's ticket to a college scholarship, surprisingly, was football. He starred on the gridiron for St. Mary's University in Nova Scotia before leaving school to move in with his sister in New Jersey. That change of plans resurrected his baseball career.
By that time, Parlin remained within a short drive of his boyhood home, transfusing his love of the game into local youth.
"The people were tremendous to us," Parlin said. They would get everything together. People that had no kids involved. And you never heard any bickering from the parents. Everybody was happy."
Parlin's wife of 61 years, Alice, was among the volunteers who patched up the first uniforms and organized fundraising oyster stew suppers.
With the surplus over the years, Parlin planned two memorable bus trips to Fenway.
"Some of those kids had never left Farmington," he said. "They kept their eyes on everything that was going on. To me, that was the greatest thing. I'll never forget that."Memory lane
To this day, the coach keeps a team picture from every season in an album. Among the youthful faces who eventually took the torch from their teacher: Parlin's son Gary, a longtime baseball and football coach at Mt. Blue High School; and Jay Kemble, who pitched at the University of Maine.
Kemble later was pitching coach to Lancaster's son, Steve, in Orono.
While Parlin's brush with fame unfolded as a spectator in Boston, Lancaster had the timing of Forrest Gump in his short affiliation with the Phillies.
His home run at a game in Greenville, S.C., measured at 512 feet, was documented in The Sporting News.
In one spring training assignment, Lancaster was battery mate to Ferguson Jenkins. Another day, he reached base at the expense of Steve Carlton.
"I was lucky enough to get a Texas League blooper to left field off Carlton," he said. "I can say it looked like a line drive on the scorecard. But I got struck out by Jerry Koosman on three pitches."
Stationed in Germany during the Vietnam conflict, Lancaster was one of two Americans afforded a spot on the German national team.
His manager also was an overseas scout for the Baltimore Orioles, leading to a second minor-league offer when Lancaster's service ended at 26.
"I was so heartbroken from being released by the Phillies in 1964 that I decided I didn't want to play again," Lancaster said, adding that he waited five years before picking up a bat again in the Pine Tree League.
Once the pastime was in their system, though, neither man could stay away.
"Baseball was always on my mind," Parlin said.
And now the game is their identity, forever.

White blood cell drop not always bad

Abstract: You have two choices: Ignore the count, or see the hematologist (blood specialist). What's the worst that can happen if you choose either? If you ignore the count, there is a remote possibility that you might be ignoring a process that will have an impact on your health. If you see the hematologist and nothing is wrong, you are out a consultation fee. To play it safe, I'd choose the latter. ANSWER: You can't compare heart valves to leaky pipes. They're quite different, and they behave quite differently. Many people at older ages have slightly leaky heart valves that don't interfere with heart action in the least. If the leaks were compromising your heart's pumping, the doctor would have jumped right in with a suggestion for immediate repair. A recent study assessed the value of glucosamine and chondroitin by themselves and in combination. When evaluated in all participants, neither glucosamine nor chondroitin nor the combination of both fared any better than a sugar pill. However, in the group of patients with moderate to severe arthritis, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin appeared to be useful. The message is that if a person has taken these supplements for three months and has not seen any results, he or she should stop taking them. If people are getting good results, they should continue. They're safe. Glucosamine might raise blood sugar, so diabetics should be aware of that. Since it comes from shellfish, people with an allergy to shellfish might be allergic to it too.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Every year when I get my blood checked, the lab report shows that my white blood cell count is below normal. It has been 2,300, 2,500 and 2,400, respectively, in the past three years. The lab says that normal is 3,500 to 9,600.
This has been going on for at least 10 years. My doctor wants me to see a hematologist. I am a 61-year-old woman who never gets sick. I'd like your opinion. My insurance will not cover this investigation, but I will pay for it if it seems appropriate. - M.M.
ANSWER: You have had a low white blood cell count for 10 years. You haven't been sick in all that time. Your count has had no impact on your health.
White blood cells are our chief defense against infections. You have had no serious infections.
Low white blood cell counts can signal trouble with the bone marrow where these cells are made. They can be a sign of cancer that has invaded the marrow. Some medicines lower the white blood cell count. There's a list of other causes. You have no symptoms to suggest those other causes.
You have two choices: Ignore the count, or see the hematologist (blood specialist). What's the worst that can happen if you choose either? If you ignore the count, there is a remote possibility that you might be ignoring a process that will have an impact on your health. If you see the hematologist and nothing is wrong, you are out a consultation fee. To play it safe, I'd choose the latter.
Are you sure your insurance won't pay for the consultation? You do have a legitimate medical condition - leukopenia (low white blood cell count). On what grounds are you being denied coverage? I'd appeal that decision.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Six years ago, I had a heart attack that resulted in triple bypass surgery, and I had to have my mitral valve replaced. Last year, my cardiologist informed me that my new mitral valve and my original aortic valve were leaking a little. He told me not to worry about it. I do worry. If you have a leak in your pipe in your home, you have it fixed immediately. I would think that applies to the body too. What do you think? - M.G.
ANSWER: You can't compare heart valves to leaky pipes. They're quite different, and they behave quite differently. Many people at older ages have slightly leaky heart valves that don't interfere with heart action in the least. If the leaks were compromising your heart's pumping, the doctor would have jumped right in with a suggestion for immediate repair.
Furthermore, unlike a pipe, valve leaks can but don't always get worse.
Your doctor will check your heart regularly, and if the leaks are increasing, he will tell you then. For now, don't dwell on them.
The booklet on heart-valve problems discusses these common medical conditions in depth. Readers can obtain a copy by writing: Dr. Donohue - No. 105, Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Enclose a check or money order (no cash) for $4.75 U.S./$6 Can. with the recipient's printed name and address. Please allow four weeks for delivery.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: My husband has chronic blepharitis and frequently develops hard buildups in both eyes that cause great discomfort. The doctor must remove them two times a month. What can be done to prevent them? - S.R.
ANSWER: Blepharitis (BLEF-uh-RYE-tiss) is inflammation of the eyelid margins, which become red and crusty. The crust can build up into hard deposits. A twice-a-day program of lid cleansing might eliminate the crusts. Have your husband apply warm compresses (a wet washcloth) to closed lids for five to 10 minutes and then massage the lids. After the massage, he cleanses the lid margins with a cotton-tipped applicator dipped in a solution of one part baby shampoo and one part water. The doctor might have to prescribe an antibiotic ointment.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: In a recent article on arthritis, you didn't mention glucosamine and chondroitin. I thought that in the past you had recommended these supplements to maintain healthy joints. As a result, I have taken the combination daily and have no joint problems. Perhaps the reason is good genes. Is this so? In any case, I feel your readers deserve a clarification. - H.F.
ANSWER: I have, in the past, endorsed glucosamine and chondroitin as possibly being useful for osteoarthritis, the kind of arthritis that just about everyone over 55 has a touch of. I don't think I ever recommended it as providing protection against arthritis. Your good genes are most likely the reason why you are arthritis-free.
Glucosamine is a protein-sugar substance that comes from the shells of crabs, lobsters and shrimp. It's believed to have a role in repairing and preserving joint cartilage. Chondroitin, a natural component of cartilage, is obtained from cows. It keeps cartilage elastic and prevents its breakdown. At least, that's how the claim goes.
A recent study assessed the value of glucosamine and chondroitin by themselves and in combination. When evaluated in all participants, neither glucosamine nor chondroitin nor the combination of both fared any better than a sugar pill. However, in the group of patients with moderate to severe arthritis, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin appeared to be useful. The message is that if a person has taken these supplements for three months and has not seen any results, he or she should stop taking them. If people are getting good results, they should continue. They're safe. Glucosamine might raise blood sugar, so diabetics should be aware of that. Since it comes from shellfish, people with an allergy to shellfish might be allergic to it too.
More studies are in store to assess these products once again.
Dr. Donohue regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but he will incorporate them in his column whenever possible. Readers may write him or request an order form of available health newsletters at P.O. Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Readers may also order health newsletters from www.rbmamall.com

Taking Baby Bennett home for Father's Day

Author: Washuk, Bonnie

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]15 June 2008: C.1.

Abstract: Father's Day will be extra special this year for Matt Wood of Gorham.

Full text: Father's Day will be extra special this year for Matt Wood of Gorham. On Friday his wife, Kate, gave birth to their son, Bennett.Wood was all smiles Saturday as he cradled the newborn at St. Mary's Regional Medical Center. Minutes later, his 2-year-old daughter, Avery, held and kissed her baby brother. "Isn't he good?" Avery said.
"We've got to keep Baby Bennett warm," Wood coached as he fixed the baby's blanket. "She loves babies," Wood said, admiring his daughter's gentleness.
Like many, Wood is a hands-on dad. "I do the cooking," he said. "I usually do the baths."
Three days a week he does the bulk of the parenting.
He works for the state of New Hampshire as a shellfish specialist, testing for bacteria and red tide. His wife, Kate, is a maternity nurse at St. Mary's. "This is my floor. They would not forgive me for going anywhere else," she said with a laugh.
Kate works three 12-hour days, which means on those days her husband gets Avery up, dressed and fed, and out the door to day care before work. At the end of the day he picks her up and feeds her dinner.
"She's good," he said. "She loves to help feed the dogs."
When his wife finishes her maternity leave, he'll have to adjust that routine to include the baby. It may not go smoothly at first, he said. "I'll probably go into work a little late the first day."
Reflecting on his childhood, Wood said he hoped Avery and Bennett have similar experiences growing up. "My father was pretty hands-on. He'd always bring us fishing, hunting. We had boats growing up."
His father was the one who, when mom said no, backed her up. "He was the last word. He was the tougher guy, but he was loving." So far Wood said he isn't the last-word dad. "I'm easygoing. I kind of give in to her."
Both sets of grandparents are still together. That's rare today, Wood said. He and Kate want the same for their children, "to have that whole-family support."
Being an active father is critical for the family's well-being, Wood said. "I can't imagine doing it (by) myself, so I can't imagine all the single mothers out there."
They have big plans for Father's Day: "We're taking him home."

Full text: CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - The Red Tide is sweeping through New Hampshire's coastal waters again.
State officials have banned taking mussels, clams and oysters from New Hampshire's coastal waters and Hampton/Seabrook Harbor. The ban is in response to high levels of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning, known as the Red Tide, found in blue mussels collected from the Isles of Shoals and the harbor.
State shellfish manager Chris Nash says it's too soon to know how long the ban will last.
People who eat contaminated shellfish can get sick or die.

Abstract: I'm sure it's nice in the summertime, too, but there's something about Mac's crowded, warmly lit interior and the meaty smells emanating from the kitchen that make it seem like a slice of heaven on a cold night. When it came time for dessert, we had to haggle for a moment before ordering. T.'s a fruit kind of guy - pies and shortcakes for him, if any dessert at all. Me? I like caramel and chocolate, or creme brulee, or occasionally a pie - but only if it's Key lime. So when we're together, we tend to settle on apple-caramel-y concoctions, because then we're both happy. All in all? Don't be afraid to go with seafood at Mac's. But don't worry too much if you feel like a steak - understatement! Take [Russ Dillingham]'s word for it.

Full text: I'm sure it's nice in the summertime, too, but there's something about Mac's crowded, warmly lit interior and the meaty smells emanating from the kitchen that make it seem like a slice of heaven on a cold night.
In fact, T. and I were so enamored of the atmosphere indoors we elected to wait for a table on a recent crowded Saturday night (we hadn't made reservations) rather than go elsewhere. It was warm, loud (in a fun sort of way) and action-packed. We talked Fed reform happily until a table opened up, and then sat down to choose meals.
Now, everyone we know (practically) has told us Mac's has amazing steaks. Photographer-extraordinaire Russ Dillingham, who always orders the regular Mini Mac (a house specialty, a 10-ounce Black Angus top sirloin, filet cut) says "you just can't get a better piece of meat anywhere."
More on that in a minute, but on that particular Saturday night, well, pardon me, but the seafood - yes, Mac's seafood - was calling my name.
Several tasty-sounding fish dishes jumped out at me. After a few minutes, I settled on the Shrimp and Scallop Casserole, which came with a salad, vegetables and my choice of starch. I picked mashed potatoes (big surprise there).
T. didn't feel like a regular steak - which is bizarre, given his history. He ordered the Angus Sirloin Tips, and got rice instead of potatoes.
Very shortly thereafter our salads arrived. His - he'd asked for Caesar dressing - came with two very delicious, long, crostini-like croutons, herbed and toasted. The vegetables were fresh and cut up into appropriately sized pieces, and we were very pleased.
We didn't have to wait long for the main courses, either.
My shrimp and scallops were presented in a very-hot casserole plate, duly buttered and bread-crumbed and smelling of delicate white-wine sauce. It smelled like the fillet of sole my mom used to make when I was a kid, in several fruitless attempts at getting me to like non-shellfish ocean-dwellers by dressing them up in delicious disguises.
It was good. The sauce was, as advertised, a buttery, lemony, wine-y mixture that complimented the shrimp and scallops and the bread crumbs. The fish itself was good, but a tiny bit overcooked. Now, not overcooking shrimp and scallops when you're serving them in a terrine of steaming broth and crumbs is a true feat, so I didn't hold it against them, and the fish was still tasty and delicious. The sides were nice, if less memorable than the salads.
I only tasted T.'s tips briefly. He was happy with them: He ate a ton, complimenting the sauce and the vegetables as well as the meat.
But if you thought we were pleased with the entrees...
When it came time for dessert, we had to haggle for a moment before ordering. T.'s a fruit kind of guy - pies and shortcakes for him, if any dessert at all. Me? I like caramel and chocolate, or creme brulee, or occasionally a pie - but only if it's Key lime. So when we're together, we tend to settle on apple-caramel-y concoctions, because then we're both happy.
Mac's had an apple-caramel tortilla dessert (with ice cream, of course) that sounded divine to us both. And let me tell you - it was. The crispy tortilla crust, sweet apple filling, gooey caramel and cool ice cream made for a perfect end to our meal.
All in all? Don't be afraid to go with seafood at Mac's. But don't worry too much if you feel like a steak - understatement! Take Dillingham's word for it.
They're "plump, juicy, tender and oh so melt-in-your-mouth delicious. My mouth is watering now. The texture of the meat is the best I have ever had."Tasty tidbits

Felon food groups Nuts, shellfish among the biggest suspects in big increase in dietary allergies

Author: Thompson, Sharon

Abstract: "All types of allergies are increasing," said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and CEO of the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network. "We're better at diagnosing food allergies." Years ago, doctors didn't recognize food allergies as such and simply labeled children as "sickly" or said they had a weak stomach. Some health professionals think that food allergies are increasing because we're all exposed to more of the "big eight" allergens through processed foods. "The best defense is education," Munoz-Furlong said. "Learn what the symptoms are, and talk to your doctor and get a diagnosis. Make sure you read the ingredient label, and talk to anyone who is giving you food. Ask about the ingredients that are in that food. Accidents are never planned. Be ready when one occurs."

Full text: As a population, Americans are becoming more allergic, and scientists don't know why.
The incidence of food allergies has skyrocketed, doubling in the last 10 years. One in 25 Americans has a food allergy, and for children younger than 3, the ratio is 1 in 17.
"All types of allergies are increasing," said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and CEO of the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network. "We're better at diagnosing food allergies."
A food allergy occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the proteins in a particular food, releasing chemicals (histamines) that cause symptoms that can include hives or gastrointestinal or respiratory distress. Symptoms, whether mild or severe, occur quickly, within a few minutes to two hours of eating. In the most severe cases, they progress to anaphylaxis, a potentially fatal condition in which the allergic reaction overtakes the entire body, according to the Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network.
"We've done such a good job eliminating childhood diseases that we grew up with that our immune systems are looking for something to do. We don't understand why our immune system selects one food over another," Munoz-Furlong said.
Allergists say any food can cause an allergic reaction, but 90 percent of the time it's one of the "big eight" foods: milk, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts (almonds, cashews, pecans, pistachios, walnuts), shellfish (shrimp, crab, lobster) and fish (tuna, salmon, catfish).
Years ago, doctors didn't recognize food allergies as such and simply labeled children as "sickly" or said they had a weak stomach. Some health professionals think that food allergies are increasing because we're all exposed to more of the "big eight" allergens through processed foods.
"As soon as you stray into the aisles of prepared and processed foods, life becomes much more complicated," said Alice Sherwood, whose son is allergic to eggs and nuts.
Sherwood wrote "Allergy-Free Cookbook" (DK Publishing, $25) because allergy-free food was something she couldn't find when she needed it. Although there are 12 million Americans affected by food allergies, there aren't many allergy-friendly products on the market, she said.
For the cook, four of these food groups (gluten, eggs, nuts, dairy) are particularly difficult to avoid because they are used in so many dishes. Research shows that most people are allergic to only one or two foods. In her book, Sherwood chose to develop alternative versions of each recipe to cater to each of those four food allergens. Each recipe has versions that are free of gluten, dairy (milk), eggs or nuts.
Children with food allergies, and their parents, always have to be on guard to prevent a reaction.
"The best defense is education," Munoz-Furlong said. "Learn what the symptoms are, and talk to your doctor and get a diagnosis. Make sure you read the ingredient label, and talk to anyone who is giving you food. Ask about the ingredients that are in that food. Accidents are never planned. Be ready when one occurs."
The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, which went into effect in January 2006, requires food manufacturers to declare food allergens in plain language on their ingredient lists. For example, before the law was passed, milk could be listed on a label as "ammonium caseinate."
The only way to prevent an allergic reaction, Munoz-Furlong said, is by strictly avoiding the food.

Full text: Although I agree that people should not subject their children to their second-hand smoke, I do not agree with the new smoking law.
State government, just like the federal government, is becoming too intrusive in our personal lives, our personal decisions, and even our personal thoughts.
If the state really wanted to protect kids, there should be laws banning all that is "potentially" unhealthy: fast food, violent cartoons, video games, candy, bacon, walking down the street, playing baseball, skiing, bike riding, visiting Los Angeles (smog), living in areas subject to tornados, shellfish, anything requiring repetitive motion, mowing the lawn, running, walking, going to school ... my God, this is a dangerous world.
Someone should do something.
Save us from ourselves.Eric Yoder, Auburn

Bag Lady So very seedy
Standing before hundreds of neat packets at the Paris Farmers Union, each completely out of my growing grasp, there was almost too much to consider.
Did I want to be thought of as nutritional (carrots,) whimsical (red sun flowers) or wholesome but gross (salsify, a.k.a. the oyster plant)?
Definitely not that last one. In its most perfect state, salsify looks like water-logged zombie fingers.
Next.
The challenge that had me mulling my leafy green likeness: A good friend's birthday. Forget heels and baubles, she wanted seeds for her big garden. Simple, sweet and fraught with possibilities.
And pressure. What if my pack were among the thousands of gifted seeds that didn't grow? What if I was a botanical dud, a plantastic disaster?
Bag Lady can bring to this gift table no personal experience. My hostas survive out of their own sheer will and despite my repeated nicks with the lawnmower.
The decision was ultimately based on looks alone. Pretty but inedible counts for something. (In both real and plant worlds.) Hope she likes them.
Unexpectedly, the trip to the Paris Farmers Union also netted my favorite overheard conversation in months, ending with this bit of wisdom from a clerk:
"What you need is bobcat urine."
There's no topping that.
French horticulture beans, Plant Hart's Seeds, $1.29
Pale yellow with a really striking red rash. The royal purple beans, same price, were lookers too.
Lumina pumpkins, Burpee, $2.49
White pumpkins that grow up to 20 pounds offer a little variety come October.
Birdhouse gourds, Plant Hart's Seeds, $1.59
For bird friends. Not to be planted near -
Cat grass, Burpee, $1.79
Bag Lady used to have a cat who jittered and rolled around in ecstasy after a few nibbles ... then peed. Yeah, we didn't give her a whole lot.
Love-Lies-Bleeding, Botanical Interests, $1.59
What a name. I need to see this movie, read this book! That these "crimson tassels cascade" is beside the point.
Coreopsis tetra-giants, Burpee, $1.79
Flowers whose petals look like glued-together butterfly wings. Coreopsis sounds so much more elegant than its nickname, tickseed.
Lemon cucumber, Burpee, $1.79
Looks like a grapefruit, tastes like a cucumber. To juice or salad spin?
Garlic chives, Plant Hart's Seeds, $1.59
The packet that had Bag Lady thinking, hmm, maybe I should start a garden. But no. More fruitful to poke a stick in the eye.
Accessories:
Neptune's Harvest organic fertilizer, 36 oz., $14.99
Made from fresh North Atlantic fish and seaweed. Liquid sushi for your plants.
Fiskars hard-shell kneepads, $20.29
You're out weeding. Ninjas attack. It happens. Now, you're totally prepared.
Fungus Pharm, 33.8 oz., $13.99
Keeps plant mildew and fungus at bay. Also an excellent title for a book with a mad gardener and a stack of bodies in his tool shed.
Best find: Watermelon Moons & Stars, Botanical Interests, $2.69
According to the packet, a genetic defect gives the green watermelon pretty yellow celestial blotches, but doesn't affect taste. Despite that, "Now with tasty genetic defect!" is not flaunted on the package.
Think twice: About forgetting to water, weed, expose to sun or sing to your seedlings. Likely what Bag Lady's been doing wrong all these years. I mean, in addition to not using enough bobcat urine.

The hydrological truth behind bottled water

Abstract: In a world where making environmentally friendly decisions is an increasingly confusing task, seeing the big picture and being well-informed are paramount. Because of this, it is distressing to read misleading information disseminated by conglomerates such as Nestle Waters, the corporate parent of Poland Spring.There is no doubt about it: Nestle Waters strives to promulgate that it is a responsible, eco-friendly corporation. In letters to the editor, it has outlined the "positive effects" another Poland Spring facility would have for the Maine economy and environment. Its Web site details the importance of "responsible management" of our most precious resource. And Poland Spring now markets a new "Eco-Shape" bottle, which uses 30 percent less plastic than comparable leading beverage brands. Increased carbon emissions. Trucks and barges transport billions of gallons of bottled water (up 1,300 percent from 1978 to 5.4 billion gallons in 2001) across the globe. This system is massively inefficient as Italians drink Poland Spring and Mainers drink San Pellegrino, and fossil fuels burned in transportation to achieve this odd exchange of the same commodity contribute to overall carbon levels in the atmosphere.

Full text: Pumping massive quantities of water from below-ground aquifers depletes surface water
In a world where making environmentally friendly decisions is an increasingly confusing task, seeing the big picture and being well-informed are paramount. Because of this, it is distressing to read misleading information disseminated by conglomerates such as Nestle Waters, the corporate parent of Poland Spring.There is no doubt about it: Nestle Waters strives to promulgate that it is a responsible, eco-friendly corporation. In letters to the editor, it has outlined the "positive effects" another Poland Spring facility would have for the Maine economy and environment.
Its Web site details the importance of "responsible management" of our most precious resource. And Poland Spring now markets a new "Eco-Shape" bottle, which uses 30 percent less plastic than comparable leading beverage brands.
Nestle Waters also backs its eco-image with donations to The Nature Conservancy and similar institutions, and explains all construction for new facilities must meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building standards. They are even switching their trucking fleet to biodiesel!
With all of these fantastic efforts toward environment conservation, what tree-hugger couldn't fall in love with Nestle Waters?
One who sees the big picture. These efforts are a desperate and costly marketing strategy designed to distract the consumer from the truth: bottling water is fundamentally environmentally irresponsible.
On its Web site, Nestle does a great job summarizing the first part of the problem: freshwater is scarce. Ninety-seven percent of the planet's water is salt, unfit for consumption, leaving about 3 percent freshwater. Of that, 2 percent is frozen in glaciers and icebergs. This remaining 1 percent comes in three forms: precipitation, surface water and underground aquifers. Agriculture uses between 65 and 70 percent of this total.
Earth's population is using that small remaining amount of freshwater faster than the hydrological cycle can replenish it; the legitimacy of the water crisis does not rest upon some busybody environmentalist cuckoo theory, but upon hydrological realities.
How does bottled water fit into this picture? The problem with bottled water, and hence the entire premise upon which Nestle Waters existence is based, is as follows:
Plastic into landfills. Bottling water pumps huge quantities of freshwater from our limited supply, adds a plastic bottle - of which approximately 13 percent is recycled, and the remaining 87 percent goes to landfill - and then sells, at a profit, a product that directly competes with local municipal water supply.
Degradation of municipal water supplies. As people come to rely less on tap water and begin to consider it inferior or distasteful, a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs: less policy and financial resources are devoted to maintaining water quality in municipal systems, and they degrade. People who cannot afford bottled water are then victimized.
Destruction of ecosystems. During pumping, aquifers are depleted and surface water levels are affected significantly, harming ecosystems that depend on them. Spawning salmon are trapped and cannot reproduce.
Recreational sanctuaries used for canoeing, swimming, and bird-watching dry up.
Essential freshwater flow to saltwater oyster and other seafood resource estuaries slows to a trickle.
Homeowners wells cease to provide adequate supply.
Environmental havoc is wrought due to the little-known, but scientific fact that an inexorable connection exists between ground and surface water: pump enough groundwater, the water table drops, surface water drains in to fill the underground voids, and lakes and steams disappear.
Increased carbon emissions. Trucks and barges transport billions of gallons of bottled water (up 1,300 percent from 1978 to 5.4 billion gallons in 2001) across the globe. This system is massively inefficient as Italians drink Poland Spring and Mainers drink San Pellegrino, and fossil fuels burned in transportation to achieve this odd exchange of the same commodity contribute to overall carbon levels in the atmosphere.
Bottling water flies in the face of environmentalism. Nestle Waters struggles to put on a good face with its list of out-of-context defenses. But in this world of increasingly limited resources, balance and moderation are key to maintaining an adequate water supply for future generations.
Bottling water is incongruous with a responsible, long-term vision.
Perhaps a few astute citizens will instead choose to tote around that unfathomably cumbersome bottle of warm tap water, and leave the Poland Spring to those a little less informed.Karen Hebold is a first-year graduate student at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, pursuing a degree in urban and regional planning.

Abstract: Atmosphere: There's a bar area that's reminiscent of Boston's Oak Room and a modern-industrial-themed dining area with a poetic-looking view of the kitchen. It's quiet, without being uncomfortably so, and the servers are attentive but don't hover. I was a little leery of dropping big bucks to find out if I agreed with them, but here at b we know there comes a time in everyone's life - cue the declaration up there - when it's necessary to go out for a fancy meal (on the company, or course). I duly made a reservation. Hubby and I got semi-decked out (just how decked can you get, I ask, when your footwear has to survive 6-inch-high piles of slush and your attire needs to be warm enough to keep you alive for three days if you get stuck in a blizzard on the soon-to-be-named "Bernard Lown Peace Bridge"?!). T. was in heaven. He kept closing his eyes and murmuring things under his breath. The flavors "melded perfectly," he raved. The tuna was so fresh that it didn't "taste fishy at all." The deep reddish Chinese brown rice, veggies, ginger and wasabe were amazingly divine. He begged me to try it.

Where: 70 Lincoln St., Lewiston
When: Tuesday-Thursday 4-9 p.m.; Friday-Saturday 4-10 p.m.
Call: 333-3663 or go to www.fishbonesag.com
Atmosphere: There's a bar area that's reminiscent of Boston's Oak Room and a modern-industrial-themed dining area with a poetic-looking view of the kitchen. It's quiet, without being uncomfortably so, and the servers are attentive but don't hover.
Prices: On the higher side for Lewiston. Appetizers for between $7 and $11, main courses starting at $18 to $19 with most over $20. Eats Fish Bones
Special occasion or otherwise, what a catch!
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one couple to affirm the bonds that have connected them with each other ... Sorry guys. I've been watching PBS Black History Month and President's Day programming all week (where, oh where, has the Piemaker gone?).
But this week's Eats is all about Valentine's Day - and the love of good food. Sure, there are probably scores of Lewistonians and Auburnites who can afford a delicious $24 main course on a semi-regular basis. I, however, am not one of those people. Fancy restaurants, for me, are usually relegated to special occasions. Occasions I have to save up for, and for which I happily look forward to donning my favorite outfit and some extra mascara. And based on my experience with you, my dear readers, many of you are in the same boat.
So until this week, I'd never set foot in Fish Bones.
The restaurant is well known in these parts (by these parts, I mean the newsroom). A dear co-worker of mine proposed to his (now) wife there, and speaks with reverence of the meal they shared there. Another went for an anniversary and says it was "very, very good." In fact, everyone I've spoken with who's actually eaten there has nothing but glowing praise for the place.
I was a little leery of dropping big bucks to find out if I agreed with them, but here at b we know there comes a time in everyone's life - cue the declaration up there - when it's necessary to go out for a fancy meal (on the company, or course). I duly made a reservation. Hubby and I got semi-decked out (just how decked can you get, I ask, when your footwear has to survive 6-inch-high piles of slush and your attire needs to be warm enough to keep you alive for three days if you get stuck in a blizzard on the soon-to-be-named "Bernard Lown Peace Bridge"?!).
When we stepped inside, we were immediately struck by the coziness of the bar area. With comfy seating and low lights, it looked like the type of place where you could sink in and sit all evening.
We were seated in the main dining room, near the kitchen. It's a large, industrial-looking space that capitalizes on its location in a former mill. There was a deep brown concrete floor (with a glorious patina), exposed brick on the walls and an open kitchen to catch your eye. Hubster and I both thought the lack of much real art (there was one older piece - print or painting, I couldn't tell - on one wall) a little incongruous. Otherwise, though, the decor was nice.
Our waitress, however, was really what made the atmosphere special. I can't really quantify what she did that stood out, but maybe that's it. She was very, very nice, but never hovered. She gave us a few menu tips when asked, refilled our water glasses with astonishing regularity and was very friendly, but she left us alone the rest of the time, absorbed in our Super Tuesday debate.
We were on the fence about ordering an appetizer, but wound up getting fish cakes. I was expecting something like crab cakes, which is what they looked like, complete with a light-colored dipping sauce and baby greens on the side. But where crab cakes are soft and gooshy inside, these were firm, full of bigger chunks of shellfish. They were fantastic.
We both ordered fish for dinner - seared sea scallops on a bed of risotto for me, sesame-crusted tuna sashimi for hubby. The meals came with a choice of soup or salad, and we both got Caesar. The salad, just like the fish cakes, was delish - real Caesar dressing with body, delicious thinly sliced bread crisps flavored with what tasted like pesto-infused oil. My only criticism there was that some of the lettuce was a little old and brown.
Shortly after we'd eaten what we wanted of our salads (trying not to eat too much, knowing what was coming), the main courses came out. They were both presented beautifully. Mine was superb. The scallops weren't overcooked - a major rarity these days - and the flavors of the leeks and tomatoes, risotto, scallops and sauce went perfectly together.
T. was in heaven. He kept closing his eyes and murmuring things under his breath. The flavors "melded perfectly," he raved. The tuna was so fresh that it didn't "taste fishy at all." The deep reddish Chinese brown rice, veggies, ginger and wasabe were amazingly divine. He begged me to try it.
Never having been a fan of tuna, of ginger, of Chinese brown rice, of wasabe or of anything even remotely sushi-esque, I demurred a few times. "You have to," he begged. "For the Sun Journal." I rolled my eyes and took a little bite. And I have to say, it was remarkably good.
After dinner - some of which I had boxed up to go - we ordered some vanilla creme brulee for dessert. As good as everything else had been, the brulee was easily the best part of the meal. I broke out in a grin and actually started laughing after the first bite. We dragged out the consumption of the little dish for almost as long as we'd spent on our main courses.
We discussed coming back again the next day for more dessert, but when we stood up - full as full can be - we decided to wait. At least for a day or two...

Unnatural merger

Abstract: What would you expect? New Hampshire's marine resources are under its fish and game division because New Hampshire's 13-mile boutique coastline is not much bigger than a Disneyland attraction. What's to manage? Maine's coastline covers about 3,500 miles, with island coastlines adding another 5,000 miles. Along it, lobster, shrimp, flounder, bloodworms, sandworms, scallops, clams, codfish, dogfish, sea cucumbers, mackerel, mussels, urchins, crabs, halibut, hake, haddock, herring, periwinkles and oysters are harvested.

Full text: I appreciated the editorial analysis of the Brookings report (Feb. 4). I take exception to the assertion that "Maine's natural resources merger has serious merit." As evidence for that, New Hampshire and Rhode Island were cited as states with combined management of their natural resources.
What would you expect? New Hampshire's marine resources are under its fish and game division because New Hampshire's 13-mile boutique coastline is not much bigger than a Disneyland attraction. What's to manage? Maine's coastline covers about 3,500 miles, with island coastlines adding another 5,000 miles. Along it, lobster, shrimp, flounder, bloodworms, sandworms, scallops, clams, codfish, dogfish, sea cucumbers, mackerel, mussels, urchins, crabs, halibut, hake, haddock, herring, periwinkles and oysters are harvested. Almost every one has its own management plan.
Rhode Island may well be able to have "one agency for all" since the entire state is just about the size of Hancock County and would fit into any one of seven other Maine counties (Aroostook, Franklin, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscatiquis, Somerset and Washington). Maine is almost 23 times bigger than Rhode Island, making the management comparison absurd.
Merging natural resources management might achieve a slight reduction in the size of state government, but at what cost? Maine's farmers, fishermen and sportsmen are having enough trouble keeping up with changes in their industries as it is.
To model Maine's natural resource management after two states that together equal less than a third the size of Maine is an exercise in futility.Jill Goldthwait, Bar Harbor

Abstract: NASHVILLE, Tenn. - A bewhiskered, beret-topped disc jockey was carted to the police station last night after a publicity stunt of burning of 600 rock 'n' roll records, mostly Elvis Presley. Leslie R. (Great) Scott! - who says the exclamation point is part of his name - is an announcer at radio station WMAK. He said he was tired of rock 'n' roll in general and Presley in particular.25 years ago, 1983

Full text: Residents of Smutty Lane Road in Saco are agitating the matter of changing the name of the road. The story of the origin of the name is that about the time this piece of road was built an extensive forest fire raged in the vicinity, leaving many acres of ground looking very black and smutty. Someone referred to the new piece of road as Smutty Lane, which name has clung to the road ever since. The road is certainly deserving of a prettier name.50 years ago, 1958
ORONO - University of Maine officials said today between 75 and 90 students were made ill over the weekend after a meal at one of the dormitory dining halls. Dr. Percy A. Leddy, campus physician, said the students became illl after Friday night's meal at the Commons Dining Hall, which serves about 400. The menu consisted of oyster stew, fruit salad, and milk.

The nation is beset by a "farm depression," but Maine farmers are faring better than their counterparts in most states, a state official said Tuesday as the Agricultural Trades Fair opened. Still, a continuing flow of imported potatoes, wobbly federal milk-price supports and possible elimination of federal credit programs are sowing hard times for Maine farmers, Agriculture Commissioner Stewart Smith said.
While a spokeswoman for the city of Portland expects no problems enforcing a recently enacted anti-obscenity ordinance, a Lewiston committee will be studying a proposed similar law to see what its ramifications could be.

Abstract: "I can remember the old man had a spoonful of mashed potatoes ... I said, 'Oh, god.' He says, 'Oh, we're fine, you're fine.' I actually remember picking up the door and putting it back and I said, 'I apologize,' and that was the end of it. People never called the station. I don't know how they fixed their door. I didn't make any arrests, but I didn't kick in any more doors without knocking first."Carrabassett Valley Chief Ron Moody "I figure I'll give the guy a hand. I'm not wearing a uniform or anything. I get out and I'm wrestling around trying to help the trooper. [Dennis Pike], who was a Farmington officer, comes running up, rips his Mace out and Maces me! Of course it hurts like hell. I probably called him a few names. 'Dennis, what the hell are you doing?' 'Oh, I didn't know it was you.'" "(Chief) Dicky Caton said, 'God damn you, you won't do that again, ever!' I just laughed. I've known him since he was a kid. They didn't think it was quite as funny. I thought it was a great trick. Take him to Farmington, dump him off. It cost me 20 bucks, but it was worth it."

Full text: Farmington Chief Richard Caton III
Age: 50
In law enforcement: 32 years
Started: Summer 1975, Franklin County Sheriff's Office; Farmington chief since 1998.
Cruising: When he started, officers patrolled in their own cars and got paid mileage. He drove a green Oldsmobile Delta with lights on the dash.
Once: "I happened to apprehend a person who had stolen a car, was under the influence and didn't have a license. By the time I pieced things together in the middle of the night, I'd recovered two stolen cars before the victims had realized their cars were stolen."
Family affair: His father retired from Franklin County. Twin sons work for the Wilton and Livermore Falls police departments. His wife is a county dispatch supervisor.
Before Tasers: "I think 25-30 years ago, people were more apt, if they had a disagreement, they'd just end up fighting with you physically. Now, just because of the unpredictability, knives and guns are more the answer where fists used to be."
Has: Seen the Rolling Stones six times. "The greatest rock and roll band. Of course, I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle ..."Franklin County Sheriff Dennis Pike
Age: 69
In law enforcement: 41 years
Started: November 1966, Farmington Police Department; sheriff since 2000. When his term is up in 2008, he'll run again, "barring some change in plans from above."
Before radios: "I would try to drive past the Sheriff's Office every half-hour or so. If they needed me they'd shut the outside light off. So if I came by and the light wasn't on by the door, I'd know either the bulb burned out or they were looking for me."
Quirky case? Driving by the Cumberland Farms on Route 4 one night in the late '70s, Pike spotted figures prowling around inside. The front entrance only opened by key, even from the inside. The freight entrance in back had been muscled open five inches.
"I spun around, drove in, pushed my bumper of my vehicle against the door, closed it, shut the (engine) off and then the pressure was off, they couldn't get out."
The two would-be thieves were trapped. The cruiser? Not a scratch.
Once: Rode in the Kingfield parade waving two hurt, bandaged hands.
In the early '80s, Pike went to an elderly couple's home at 8 a.m. to find a large, ugly dog on the porch, keeping them pinned inside. As he crept close, the dog lunged and severely bit both hands before he could shoot it. (Tests showed the dog wasn't rabid but had a dozen abscesses on its brain.)
Pike went to the hospital. By 1 p.m., he was waving to the crowds. "I couldn't let them down on that short of notice."Lewiston Chief William Welch
Age: 55
In law enforcement: 31 years
Started: September 1976, Lewiston Police Department; chief since 1998. He headed the state's first mountain bike program in 1990.
Has: Been cut in the stomach with a butcher knife by a woman upset that other people had teased her for being overweight and shot at by a homeless man camping in the woods.
We wanna rock! In the '70s, the Central Maine Civic Center oversold a Blue Oyster Cult show by 3,000 tickets, leading to a riot in the parking lot. Ugly concert-goers got a side door open and trampled an officer. He helped grab the man, thinking, "'I'm going to get killed here. People were just crazy."
Most embarrassing: Also in the '70s, Welch and a seasoned officer responded to a complaint of people smoking pot in a vacant downtown building. The doors were locked.
"He was an older guy. He says, 'Kick in the door.' I said, 'Oh my god, this is like Adam-12.' I kicked in the door, I kicked in half a dozen doors."
They didn't find anyone. A few nights later, he and another young officer got called back for a similar complaint. "We go up, I kick in a few doors. I let him kick in a few doors so he can get used to it."
Finally, Welch spotted a light, ran up, kicked down the door and found a family eating dinner. Turned out, only the rear of the building was vacant.
"I can remember the old man had a spoonful of mashed potatoes ... I said, 'Oh, god.' He says, 'Oh, we're fine, you're fine.' I actually remember picking up the door and putting it back and I said, 'I apologize,' and that was the end of it. People never called the station. I don't know how they fixed their door. I didn't make any arrests, but I didn't kick in any more doors without knocking first."Carrabassett Valley Chief Ron Moody
Age: 62
In law enforcement: 42 years
Started: June 1965, Ogunquit Police Department; Carrabassett Valley chief since 1988, when he founded the department. He's retiring in March.
No cool for you! When he started with the State Police, officers wore wool uniforms and cruisers had no air conditioning. If a car came with it, the AC was disconnected, out of fairness and to save gas.
Close call: He had his neck broken in Phillips in 1980. It was 1 a.m., after a drunk-driving stop. The driver's door was open. While he talked to passengers, another drunk driver hit the door and slammed it in on him. Amazingly, Moody ran to his cruiser and drove after the guy. He was arrested on the spot. The broken neck was diagnosed the next day.
Once: Working undercover, he left his German shepherd in the back of an Audi 5000 with several pounds of marijuana. The dog ate the pot and the whole back of the driver's seat. Boss wasn't happy.
Ouch: In the mid-'80s, driving back from a long day of undercover, he passed an accident scene with an officer trying to subdue a man that had been in a high-speed chase.
"I figure I'll give the guy a hand. I'm not wearing a uniform or anything. I get out and I'm wrestling around trying to help the trooper. Dennis Pike, who was a Farmington officer, comes running up, rips his Mace out and Maces me! Of course it hurts like hell. I probably called him a few names. 'Dennis, what the hell are you doing?' 'Oh, I didn't know it was you.'"
Bonus prank: Tired of taking a local mentally ill man on what seemed like an annual - and always lengthy - trip to be committed, often at St. Mary's, Moody made a detour to the Farmington McDonald's. He gave the man money, asked him to buy a burger and drove off. It wasn't long before he heard radio traffic about a mentally disturbed person at McDonald's. Farmington police had to make the trip to commit him.
"(Chief) Dicky Caton said, 'God damn you, you won't do that again, ever!' I just laughed. I've known him since he was a kid. They didn't think it was quite as funny. I thought it was a great trick. Take him to Farmington, dump him off. It cost me 20 bucks, but it was worth it."

Abstract: Tissue dies. It looks like the flesh-eating infection, but it's not exactly the same. (The flesh-eating bacterium is a strep bacterium.) Immediate treatment with antibiotics can halt its course, but it still carries a death rate of 25 percent. When both bladder and uterus drop, a donut-shaped pessary fits onto the neck of the uterus to keep both organs where they should be. If only the bladder drops, a pessary with a slightly different shape can support it. DEAR DR. [DONOHUE]: A friend of mine told me about her son being on dialysis. His grandmother had the same problem and passed it to her grandson through his mother. The mother called the condition Alport's syndrome. I have never heard of it. I can't find it in the medical dictionary.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: In my state on the Gulf of Mexico, a distinguished citizen was infected with a bacterium called Vibrio vulnificus after swimming during a fishing trip.
The infection quickly developed into a flesh-eating one. He had had an almost-healed ulcer on his lower leg when he went swimming.
Eventually the germ entered his bloodstream. He was quite ill. What about our mouths? If we have a sore inside our mouth, should we be rinsing with mouthwash so no germs can enter the blood? Or if we burn a finger and later mess with plants, will bacteria enter? - O.N.
ANSWER: Even the ocean's salty water is home to bacteria.
Vibrio vulnificus is one such bacterium. It thrives on salt and causes two different illnesses.
One is the kind you describe. The bacterium enters the skin through a break in it, even a trivial one. It spreads rapidly, causing the skin to redden, swell and become discolored.
Tissue dies. It looks like the flesh-eating infection, but it's not exactly the same. (The flesh-eating bacterium is a strep bacterium.) Immediate treatment with antibiotics can halt its course, but it still carries a death rate of 25 percent.
The second Vibrio vulnificus is a digestive-tract infection most often brought on by eating raw oysters contaminated with it. The germ gains access to the blood and leads to fever, chills and a drop in blood pressure. From the blood, it reaches the skin, where it causes blisters that eventually form ulcers. This infection has a fatality of 50 percent.
We live in a world of germs. That shouldn't upset you. These germs have lived among humans forever and ever. Humans manage to survive quite well in spite of them.
Only a few organisms are great troublemakers, and sensible precautions can protect us from most of those invaders. A person does not have to always swish germicidal washes in the mouth or do more than keep an open wound clean and bandaged to survive deadly but rare infections.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I am 90 years old. My bladder is falling. Can a stitch be put in down there to hold it up?
How far out can it come? I don't want surgery, at my age. - M.B.
ANSWER: Several stitches can be put in down there to close the vagina. That stops the bladder (and the uterus, which often drops with it) from protruding outside the vagina.
You also can be fitted with a special pessary to prop up the bladder. A pessary is a device inserted into the vagina to hold falling organs in place.
When both bladder and uterus drop, a donut-shaped pessary fits onto the neck of the uterus to keep both organs where they should be. If only the bladder drops, a pessary with a slightly different shape can support it.
Bladders and uteruses drop because their supporting ligaments weaken with age. A fallen bladder - a cystocele (SIS-toe-seal) - can make women lose control of urine. The bladder can fall right through the vagina and be exposed to the outside.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: A friend of mine told me about her son being on dialysis. His grandmother had the same problem and passed it to her grandson through his mother. The mother called the condition Alport's syndrome. I have never heard of it. I can't find it in the medical dictionary.
Tell me something about this condition, please. - G.H.
ANSWER: Alport's syndrome is inherited. Its early signs are blood (often visible only with a microscope) in the urine, along with protein.
In 85 percent of Alport's patients, the defective gene is on the X chromosome.
Women have two X chromosomes, so their good X chromosome can negate the effects of the bad one, and they don't usually have severe symptoms.
Men, with only one X chromosome, frequently end up with severe kidney problems and have to undergo kidney dialysis or a kidney transplant.

Pinworm: Most common worm infection

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]03 Dec 2007: C11.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/378903810?accountid=10457

Abstract: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I hope you don't find pinworms as repulsive as I do. My second-grader has them. He is constantly scratching. How do I know for sure if it's pinworms, and how are they treated? We have a dog. Is he involved in this? This subject makes me ill. - S.S. ANSWER: Pinworms don't repulse me. I'm sure they have a purpose in the grand scheme of things, but I don't know what that purpose is. They're the most common worm infection in the United States and Canada, and many, many mothers face the same challenge you do: getting rid of them. DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Is molluscum the same as a wart? My daughter has a few, and the doctor doesn't seem a bit concerned about it - but I am. He hasn't prescribed anything for her. She's in kindergarten. How long does this last? - C.K.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I hope you don't find pinworms as repulsive as I do. My second-grader has them. He is constantly scratching. How do I know for sure if it's pinworms, and how are they treated? We have a dog. Is he involved in this? This subject makes me ill. - S.S.
ANSWER: Pinworms don't repulse me. I'm sure they have a purpose in the grand scheme of things, but I don't know what that purpose is. They're the most common worm infection in the United States and Canada, and many, many mothers face the same challenge you do: getting rid of them.
They have nothing to do with personal cleanliness or poor housekeeping.
Pinworms live in the terminal portion of the small intestine. At night, pregnant worms sashay down the colon to the skin surrounding the anus, where they lay their eggs.
The eggs initiate a profound itch, to which the infected person responds with an equally profound scratch. Most itching occurs at night, and the child (or adult) reflexively scratches while still asleep. Scratching glues eggs to the fingers and under the fingernails, and the scratcher can pass them to others.
Aside from the itch, pinworms are almost never associated with any serious illness.
You can identify the worms by looking for them with a magnifying glass. They're white, about 0.4 inches long and as thick as a strand of thread. If this proves too much for you, let your doctor do the job of identification.
Vermox and Albenza are two medicines that usually can end a pinworm invasion.
Pets do not get human pinworms. Your dog is off the hook.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Is molluscum the same as a wart? My daughter has a few, and the doctor doesn't seem a bit concerned about it - but I am. He hasn't prescribed anything for her. She's in kindergarten. How long does this last? - C.K.
ANSWER: Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection, as are warts, but the similarity ends there. The molluscum virus produces a tiny, dome-shaped, pearly skin bump whose center becomes depressed. It looks like a small version of a volcano, somewhat similar to a goose bump.
The face, eyelids, neck and thighs are places where these bumps are most often found. Most children (or adults) have a small number of the bumps, two to 20. If the immune system is on the fritz or if the infected person also has eczema, the outbreak can be widespread and the bumps are numerous.
For most, molluscum contagiosum regresses in anywhere from two months to two years. The doctor can scrape them off with a special instrument or can prescribe creams or ointments that hasten their departure. It's sometimes wiser to leave them be, since overly aggressive treatment can cause scarring.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Please discuss TMJ. I think I might have it. My jaw hurts all the time. My cousin has it. She and I have similar bone structure, so I believe I could have it too. - L.M.
ANSWER: TMJ is the temporomandibular joint, the joint where the jawbone joins the skull. If you put a finger slightly low in front of your ear and open your mouth, you can feel the TMJ joint.
The TMJ syndrome is pain in that joint, sometimes with clicking or popping sounds when the mouth opens and closes, at times with the jaw locking in place, and often with limited joint motion.
Causes of the syndrome are many. Spasms of the jaw muscles can produce it. They also cause teeth grinding - especially at night. Arthritis of the joint is another cause. Misalignment of the jaw with the skull is a possible cause.
Your dentist is an expert on TMJ syndrome, and you should consult him or her for confirmation of your suspicion.
If you do have it, simple measures like hot compresses to the joint many times a day can be most helpful. Anti-inflammatory drugs, ones used for arthritis - ibuprofen, naproxen, etc. - often eliminate the pain. Your dentist will tell you if you need a mouth guard during sleep to relax the jaw muscles and the jaw joint.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: What can you tell me about polycythemia? My doctor thinks I have it. I feel great, but I had some lab work done in preparation for a physical exam, and the doctor called to tell me about my blood count. I'm afraid to keep the follow-up appointment. Is this cancer? - R.R.
ANSWER: Polycythemia isn't cancer. It's too many red blood cells (and white blood cells and platelets). The bone marrow shifts into high gear in its production of these cells. Headache, dizziness, fatigue and bleeding are some of its symptoms. If you do have polycythemia, treatment is quite straightforward: remove the excessive number of blood cells by removing blood. If need be, there are medicines for treatment too. Hydroxyurea is one.

Full text: Dear Sun Spots: I have three "Jesse Stone" movies featuring Tom Selleck. I believe there are five in this series. Can you please find the titles of the last two and where they may be purchased?
Also, I am unable to find Cincinnati Chili Mix. I have searched the Hannaford stores but have not been able to locate this product. Thank you for any assistance. - No Name, Wilton.
Answer: Regarding your first question, Sun Spots has learned the five are: "Stone Cold" AKA "Jesse Stone: Stone Cold" or "Robert B. Parker's Stone Cold," released Feb. 20, 2005; "Jesse Stone: Night Passage," released Jan. 15, 2006; "Jesse Stone: Death In Paradise," released April 30, 2006; "Jesse Stone: Sea Change," released May 22, 2007. The last, "Jesse Stone: Thin Ice" is currently in production and scheduled to be released in 2008. The Jesse Stone Film Collection (Stone Cold/Death in Paradise/Night Passage) is featured on www.amazon.com and you might also check out the site for Sea Change.
In addition, try purchasing your chili item by calling 1-800-TO-CINCY or check out www.cincinnati-to-you.com, which features lots of Cincinnati favorites.
Also, according to www.answers.com, Cincinnati chili sauce contains finely ground beef, seasoned with a mixture of spices. Vegetarians have the option of substituting beans and rice for meat. Some aficionados report a distinct hint of cinnamon and sometimes even chocolate. However, the precise identity of other spices is hard to determine. The flavor of Cincinnati chili is distinct from that of the more widely recognized Texas-style chili, and differs from that variety too in its thinness, which makes it more suitable as a sauce for other dishes than as a dish by itself. This distinctiveness makes the chili a greatly missed delicacy among many former Cincinnati-area residents.
You and your family might enjoy the following recipe over the holiday season:
Cincinnati Chili, www.mofflypub.com, Ingredients: 2 pounds ground chuck, 2 onions, finely chopped, 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped, 2 cups beef broth, 2 cups (one 16-ounce can) tomato sauce, 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, 3 Tablespoons chili powder, 1 tablespoon paprika, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate, chopped, 5 whole allspice berries, 5 whole black peppercorns, 4 whole cloves, 1 small cinnamon stick, broken in half, 1 large bay leaf, broken in half.
Optional additions: 1 pound spaghetti, cooked and drained, 2 cups canned kidney beans, drained, 1 cup chopped onion, 11/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, Oyster crackers.
Method: In a heavy five-quart stock pot, cook the meat, onions and garlic over low heat until the meat is no longer pink and vegetables are softened. (Don't allow the meat to brown, but mash it a bit with the back of a spoon to keep it soft and unclumped). Drain off excess fat. Stir in the beef broth, one cup of water, tomato sauce, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, paprika, cumin, oregano, cayenne, salt and chocolate. Tie the allspice berries, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon stick and bay leaf in a cheesecloth bag and add to the pot. Partially cover and simmer very gently to a thick sauce consistency, about two hours. Watch carefully for the last 30 minutes and completely cover the pot if the sauce starts to get too thick to ladle. Discard the spice bag and add additional salt to taste. Serve the chili immediately over spaghetti along with various side bowls of beans, onion, cheese and crackers for guests to garnish as they wish. The chili is even better reheated the next day when the flavors have had a chance to meld.
Dear Sun Spots: I would like to thank everyone who called in regards to the overabundance of books I had to give away, (Sun Spots inquiry Nov. 9): They were all gone very quickly.
I thank all who called and thank you for your service. Please note that I am all set. I don't need any more calls. - No Name, No Town.

Abstract: Florida environmental commissioner Michael Sole said the decision "further jeopardizes the threatened and endangered species" and "starves the overall health of the fragile ecosystem." "They're all neighbors, there all working together," Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said. "We'll get through this." Florida backed away from the agreement last week, saying the reductions could cause a "catastrophic collapse of the oyster industry" and "displace the entire economy" in the Florida Panhandle.

Full text: ATLANTA (AP) - Federal biologists signed off on a plan Friday to reduce the flow of water from Lake Lanier, the main water source for Atlanta and the focal point of a three-state water fight as the Southeast contends with a historic drought.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided that federally protected mussels can live with less water from Lanier, which could allow drought-stricken Georgia to keep more water in the drying lake.
The Army Corps of Engineers immediately reduced the flow of water from Lanier to Florida by 5 percent, and said it could cut it by 17 percent depending on lake levels.
"We feel like we've got the most flexible system to meet the needs, from the headwaters of Lake Lanier down to Apalachicola Bay," Brig. Gen. Joseph Schroedel said.
Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue has criticized the federal government for continuing what he calls excessive water releases from north Georgia reservoirs even as the drought threatens Atlanta's water supplies.
The fast-growing Atlanta region relies on the lake for drinking water. But power plants in Florida and Alabama depend on healthy river flows, as do farms, commercial fisheries, industrial users and municipalities. The corps also is required to release adequate flows to ensure habitats for species protected by the Endangered Species Act, such as the mussels.
Florida and Alabama have balked at Georgia's effort to keep more water, arguing that its demands were unreasonable and that reducing the flows downstream could cripple their economies.
Alabama seemed mollified by the Corps decision, as Gov. Bob Riley said he was "very satisfied and very pleased."
But Florida environmental commissioner Michael Sole said the decision "further jeopardizes the threatened and endangered species" and "starves the overall health of the fragile ecosystem."
Federal officials said the states have promised to collaborate on a long-term water pact.
"They're all neighbors, there all working together," Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said. "We'll get through this."
More than a quarter of the Southeast is covered by an "exceptional" drought - the National Weather Service's worst drought category.
Earlier this month, at a three-state water meeting in Washington, the corps said it wanted to temporarily cut the flow of water to Florida by 16 percent until the drought breaks, but needed the approval of Fish and Wildlife.
It made for a temporary truce in a tug-of-war that has pitted the states against each other for the better part of two decades, but has intensified as record drought descended over much of the region.
However, Florida backed away from the agreement last week, saying the reductions could cause a "catastrophic collapse of the oyster industry" and "displace the entire economy" in the Florida Panhandle.
Meanwhile in Washington, a panel of federal appeals judges questioned whether the corps has the authority to divvy up portions of the lake for drinking water instead of producing power.
In one of seven active lawsuits in the water wars, attorneys for all three states argued before the panel over a 2003 settlement in which the Corps agreed to allow Georgia to use nearly 25 percent of Lanier for drinking water storage.
The long-term agreement, which has not yet been implemented, is a linchpin of Georgia's water plans for the coming decades. Currently, the state gets water from Lanier under smaller, short-term contracts.
Florida and Alabama have fought the agreement, arguing that Lanier was built to produce hydropower and that under federal law only Congress has authority to significantly alter the functions of federal reservoirs.
The three judges presiding over the case appeared to sympathize with Florida and Alabama during oral arguments, sharply questioning attorneys for Georgia and the Corps over claims that the shift is not significant enough to trigger congressional involvement.
At one point, an attorney for the corps acknowledged that the agency has never made such a large change without first getting congressional approval.
The court is expected to issue a decision in the coming months.

Abstract: Many people think so. An online poll conducted by sex therapist Linda De Villers found that strawberries, ice cream, pasta and whipped cream are the four foods most commonly associated with lust. But according to Martha Hopkins, coauthor of "The New InterCourses: An Aphrodisiac Cookbook," there are no real aphrodisiacs. "Still," she laughs, "whatever makes you groan when you eat it counts." In the end, [Sean] was right. Aphrodisiacs are personal. He loves bacon, while my friend James can't think of anything sexier than Nutella, that thick chocolate-hazelnut spread that is "perfect for feeding each other," he says.

Full text: The other day, when I told my boyfriend, Sean, that I was going to be doing a little research on aphrodisiacs, he was surprisingly keen to help out.
"I'll buy the bacon," he said.
"Bacon is not an aphrodisiac," I said.
"Wanna bet?" he challenged.
Sean loves bacon - and, come to think of it, it did seem to put him in the mood for love. (On reflection, I realized that I had unconsciously begun incorporating it into more and more meals, wrapping thin strips around chunks of cod and adding crispy bits to pasta sauces.)
But can food produce sexual desire? Or, to put it another way, do aphrodisiacs actually exist?
Many people think so. An online poll conducted by sex therapist Linda De Villers found that strawberries, ice cream, pasta and whipped cream are the four foods most commonly associated with lust. But according to Martha Hopkins, coauthor of "The New InterCourses: An Aphrodisiac Cookbook," there are no real aphrodisiacs.
"Still," she laughs, "whatever makes you groan when you eat it counts."
If you think about it, a greasy slab of cured pork belly is no odder than many other foods that have historically been considered aphrodisiacs: asparagus, artichokes, avocadoes, bananas, black beans, chili peppers, figs, licorice and pine nuts have all been hailed for their ability to arouse desire.
In renaissance Europe, women were forbidden to eat artichokes, which according to legend had been created when the Greek god Zeus transformed a young maiden into the spiky vegetable. As a result, they were prescribed to men to improve their bedroom performance.
Of history's most famous aphrodisiacs, only chocolate and oysters still hold claim to their sensual reputation.
While the physical suggestion of sex may be enough for some, modern research shows that some classic aphrodisiacs can stimulate desire - and increase performance. Oysters, for example, contain high levels of zinc, which has been associated with increased sexual potency in men.
The smell of food, too, can elicit sexual feelings, according to research by Alan Hirsch, the neurological director of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago. Having noticed that people who lost their sense of smell also had a diminished sexual appetite.
Men responded to all of the aromas. But the top spot went to a blend of pumpkin pie and lavender, which increased blood flow 40 percent of the time. Runners-up were doughnuts with black licorice (31.5 percent) and pumpkin pie with doughnuts (20 percent).
Women, in contrast, responded most to the blend of cucumber and licorice - two traditional aphrodisiacs - and the scent of baby powder. But perhaps more revealing were the three scents that turned women off: cherries, barbecued meat and men's cologne. So much for the thrill of the grill.
In the end, Sean was right. Aphrodisiacs are personal. He loves bacon, while my friend James can't think of anything sexier than Nutella, that thick chocolate-hazelnut spread that is "perfect for feeding each other," he says.
And for "InterCourses" author Hopkins, the sexiest food is grilled asparagus dipped in her French boyfriend's homemade mayonnaise. But, she adds, the greatest turn-on of all is when he cooks, and then does the dishes.
"If you think it's an aphrodisiac, it always works," Hopkins says. So pour the champagne, grill asparagus or feed your true love strawberries.
At my house, we'll be eating heart-shaped waffles and a (hearty) side of bacon.

Full text: The sun is moving opposite your sign, and this means you shouldn't give in to personal melodrama. You might want to lash out in frustration at your sweetheart. But you'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. Be kind and others will be kind to you.Taurus
Saturn is helping you to create a harmonious home with your honey. Or if you're single, you're putting finishing touches on your living space after some recent redecorations or furniture purchases. Domestic vibes are powerful and peaceful for you right now.Gemini
Don't second guess yourself this week. The moon could create some momentary feelings of doubt. You know you're making the right romantic choices, so don't let those fears overwhelm you. Stick with what you're doing and don't look back.Cancer
Uranus continues to kick up the personal melodrama. You could be breaking up with someone, starting out with someone new, and settling up issues with a past love from years ago all in the same week. Take a deep breath. This will soon pass.Leo
If your honey doesn't understand you, maybe it's wrong to expect him or her to be a mind reader all the time. A Venus square is reminding you that any good relationship requires hard work. Be gentler, more communicative, and more supportive.Virgo
There is a full moon opposite your sign this week, creating some intense emotions. You could have flashes of a past relationship. Don't let these memories throw you off track. It's important to focus on the future, not the old days.Libra
With the sun in your sign, the world is your oyster. If you want to seduce someone, you'll find it easy to impress and amaze that cutie. If you're in a relationship, you'll enjoy increased compatibility and amazing levels of passion with your current flame.Scorpio
The moon is turning you into a sentimental fool. You could craft a lusty email or write a gushy love letter. Or you might make a sexy confession to someone over dinner and a cup of red wine. You'll want to reveal your true desires.Sagittarius
Mars is moving opposite your sign for a few weeks, and this means you shouldn't make any big moves. If you need to make a major life decision, take plenty of time before settling on a choice. A relationship could require more finesse and patience.Capricorn
Sometimes when it comes to expressing yourself, you're a little clumsy. You don't mean to offend. You just choose words that are a little brusque or aloof. The moon is reminding you to use language that is more emotionally warm with your sweetheart.Aquarius
A happy sun is giving you lots of physical energy. You'll work out, go for a long jog afterwards, and still have plenty of stamina to go dancing with your honey. Burn off extra energy by getting into shape at the gym.Pisces

Wine drinkers join ABC Club (as in Anything But Chardonnay)

Author: Perry, Claudia

Abstract: "Pinot grigio was huge then and it's still huge," says [Gary Vaynerchuk], who rarely waffles on anything related to wine. "I've been watching pinot gris for 10 or 15 years. I like one pinot gris from Alsace (a wine region in France) and some from Oregon. They're better for the money than some from Italy." For civilians, the nose is how the wine smells and the "finish" is how long the taste lingers after you drink. With some wines, you have the feeling of "Where did it go?" seconds after you swallow. If the taste and texture stick around, that's a long finish. The sugar Vaynerchuk is referring to is not a syrupy taste, but a building block of the wine's structure. Too much residual sugar can flatten out the taste of the wine. "We're seeing more Old World style pinot gris," [Jay Emminger] says. "Instead of the New World fruit-forward style, it's getting back to its origins, especially in Alsace and Oregon."

Full text: If you're a wine drinker, you might be a member in good standing of the ABC Club. In this case, "ABC" stands for Anything But Chardonnay.
After years of drinking oaky, fruit bombs that offered little for the thoughtful wine drinker, more wine lovers are turning to pinot grigio, which is also known as pinot gris if it's not grown in Italy. The white wine offers sharper, citrus-like notes and goes well with some foods. You can also enjoy pinot grigio on the deck with friends and no food at all.
We asked a pair of New Jersey wine experts, Gary Vaynerchuk from the Wine Library in Springfield and Jay Emminger, consulting wine director for Sparrow Wine and Liquors in Hoboken, for some pinot grigio recommendations. These wine vendors offer online ordering and shipping to states where permitted, so you may be able to browse and buy without leaving home.
Vaynerchuk, 31, whose enthusiastic videos on the Wine Library Web site earned him a recent guest spot on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien," says pinot grigio found its niche some years back with the arrival of Santa Margherita on these shores from Italy.
"Pinot grigio was huge then and it's still huge," says Vaynerchuk, who rarely waffles on anything related to wine. "I've been watching pinot gris for 10 or 15 years. I like one pinot gris from Alsace (a wine region in France) and some from Oregon. They're better for the money than some from Italy."
Vaynerchuk likes pairing pinot grigio with oysters, Thai food and seafood dishes. "It has more intricacy than an overoaked Chardonnay."
Ironically, Vaynerchuk's favorite is the 2005 Fantinel Tessis, which is available for $9.99. It's Italian with notes of mango and pineapple on the nose, and surprisingly long finish.
"It has great body," Vaynerchuk says. "It's clean and crisp with not too much sugar."
For civilians, the nose is how the wine smells and the "finish" is how long the taste lingers after you drink. With some wines, you have the feeling of "Where did it go?" seconds after you swallow. If the taste and texture stick around, that's a long finish. The sugar Vaynerchuk is referring to is not a syrupy taste, but a building block of the wine's structure. Too much residual sugar can flatten out the taste of the wine.
Vaynerchuk also recommended the 2006 Chehalem Pinot Gris from Oregon, which sells for $16.99 at the Library.
"This has some guts and could stand up to being served with salmon or other fatty fish," Vaynerchuk says. "It's pretty darn cool."
Emminger recommends that you don't wait more than a couple of years to drink pinot gris. For example, a 2005 wine should be drunk now.
"We're seeing more Old World style pinot gris," Emminger says. "Instead of the New World fruit-forward style, it's getting back to its origins, especially in Alsace and Oregon."
(Another wine fan to civilian translation: The Old World encompasses wine growing regions of Europe, which place more emphasis on wine in relation to food with subtle flavors. The New World is pretty much everywhere else on the planet, where wine is often drunk like a cocktail. So some New World winemakers emphasize alcohol content and very straightforward flavors).
Emminger offered several recommendations that are available at Sparrow. The 2006 Kris, from Italy's Veneto region, is a good value at $11.99. This is an everyday, go-to wine, Emminger says.
For special occasions, Emminger recommends the 2005 Kofererhof from the Alto Adige region of Italy at $22.99. These wines are characterized by their medium to short finishes and citrus and mineral accents on the nose and palate.
Saint Michael Eppan 2004, another wine from the Alto Adige, sells for $14.99 and is, according to Emminger, "nice, clean and great on the palate."
Lastly, Emminger recommends the 2006 Lange, which sells for $16.99 and comes from the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Oregon's pinot noirs are widely renowned, but the pinot gris are coming up strong.

Mr. Bean takes a mean turn

Abstract: The journey begins when [Bean] wins a Cannes vacation and a digital camcorder in a raffle. En route, he loses everything - tickets, luggage and travel documents - but finds a few new friends. He teams up with a mischievous Russian boy (Max Baldry) separated from his father (Karel Roden), who's heading to Cannes to serve on the judging panel. Bean also inexplicably charms a beautiful actress (Emma de Caunes) on the road to the film fest for the premiere of her latest picture, "Playback Time" from an American auteur named Carson Clay (Dafoe). Along the way, the hero captures his vacation on a camcorder and winds up accidentally creating a hit movie at the festival. Although "Mr. Bean's Holiday" takes a few swipes at Euro snobs, ultimately the most ridiculous character is the arrogant American. It's no surprise the comedy is already an international hit.

Full text: Film focus
WHAT:
RATED: G. Contains incredibly crude humor.
RATING: 11/2 stars
RUNNING TIME; 87 minutes Mr. Bean takes a mean turn
For a silly kids movie about an accident-prone man on a trip to the beach, "Mr. Bean's Holiday" is actually quite mean-spirited and pretentious.
There are laughs for kids as the title character (Rowan Atkinson) has a variety of misadventures in transit from Britain to southern France, but the picture also has an off-putting insider vibe, setting its closing scene at the Cannes Film Festival.
The hero crashes the event and plays pranks on an art-house director (Willem Dafoe) who's premiering a ponderous movie to yawns from the crowd. The film within a film seems to be a parody of Vincent Gallo's "The Brown Bunny," a misunderstood road movie that was booed when it screened at Cannes four years ago. The reference is pretty obscure given the preschool demographic.
The film pokes unfair fun at Gallo's work when it has its own questionable segments. During one particularly long, misguided set piece, the protagonist wanders onto a World War II film set where a faux French village is being attacked by German soldiers. Mr. Bean is put into costume as an extra and performs a mock goosestep march. It's always nice to see children's movies with Nazi jokes.
A belated follow-up to 1997's "Bean," the film contains distasteful scenes that make you feel guilty for laughing at the amusing ones. Highlights include a roadside outhouse mishap, a crisis involving a coffee-splashed laptop and an adventurous lunch of cold shellfish at a snooty restaurant. Yes, those are the highlights.
Director Steve Bendelack, who has a lengthy resume of Britcom credits, stages unfortunate incidents on French trains and highways. Occasionally, Mr. Bean is the victim of circumstance. Most of the time, however, he drags innocent bystanders down into his world of disorder. At one point, he unwittingly prompts a suicidal man to jump to his death from a bridge. Good times.
The journey begins when Bean wins a Cannes vacation and a digital camcorder in a raffle. En route, he loses everything - tickets, luggage and travel documents - but finds a few new friends. He teams up with a mischievous Russian boy (Max Baldry) separated from his father (Karel Roden), who's heading to Cannes to serve on the judging panel. Bean also inexplicably charms a beautiful actress (Emma de Caunes) on the road to the film fest for the premiere of her latest picture, "Playback Time" from an American auteur named Carson Clay (Dafoe).
Along the way, the hero captures his vacation on a camcorder and winds up accidentally creating a hit movie at the festival. Although "Mr. Bean's Holiday" takes a few swipes at Euro snobs, ultimately the most ridiculous character is the arrogant American. It's no surprise the comedy is already an international hit.

Abstract: Like you, I'm not sure if your husband had an allergic reaction, but I wouldn't tell him to order shrimp again - at least for the present. I have to leave this to an allergist. Skin tests, the kind where the allergen is put on the skin and then the skin is pricked, can help settle the question. Blood tests for allergies are another way of getting at the answer. There is also a "food challenge" test, where the patient is given the suspicious food. This isn't a test to be done by people on their own. It's something that's occasionally done in the doctor's office with equipment and medicines at hand to terminate a reaction if one occurs. DEAR DR. [DONOHUE]: I am writing about the person whose 87-year-old father has an irregular heartbeat and has to take Coumadin. You said there is not a better medicine for dissolving blood clots. I took myself off Coumadin and started taking nattokinase. I don't think you should publish this letter, because I don't want anyone else to do the same. - C.Z. ANSWER: I don't want anyone else to substitute nattokinase for Coumadin either, and I think you ought to reconsider your stand. Coumadin doesn't dissolve clots. It prevents them. Nattokinase is an enzyme extracted from natto - a Japanese dish made from boiled soybeans. It can dissolve clots. However, it's effectiveness in preventing clots in humans isn't known. Coumadin's effectiveness has been demonstrated. Blood thinning is too serious an issue to fool around with anything but a medicine with proven results.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: My husband is 63 and in good health. He has never had food allergies, but a recent incident has us wondering. He ordered shrimp at a quality restaurant at about 5:30 p.m. He woke up at 1:30 a.m., gasping for breath. When he was finally able to breathe, he said his throat had completely closed up. We always thought food allergies happened immediately. Do you think he is allergic to shellfish? - M.L.
ANSWER: Symptoms typical of an allergic reaction include flushing, itching, sneezing, tearing, nasal dripping and more serious things like choking, wheezing, difficulty breathing and a racing heart. Most food allergies occur from minutes to two hours after eating the provoking food. However, sometimes food allergies occur in two cycles, one hitting early and the second cycle striking several hours later.
Some 2 percent to 3 percent of adults have a seafood allergy, and the allergy can develop later in life. In fact, children have only a 1 percent seafood allergy. That tells you people develop this as adults.
Like you, I'm not sure if your husband had an allergic reaction, but I wouldn't tell him to order shrimp again - at least for the present. I have to leave this to an allergist. Skin tests, the kind where the allergen is put on the skin and then the skin is pricked, can help settle the question. Blood tests for allergies are another way of getting at the answer. There is also a "food challenge" test, where the patient is given the suspicious food. This isn't a test to be done by people on their own. It's something that's occasionally done in the doctor's office with equipment and medicines at hand to terminate a reaction if one occurs.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: A friend has been diagnosed with sarcoidosis. What can you tell me about it? - N.T.
ANSWER: Sarcoidosis is a mysterious illness whose cause has evaded detection even though it has been pursued for decades upon decades. It's an illness that can affect just about every body organ including liver, eye, skin, joints, lymph nodes, kidney, heart and digestive tract. However, the organ that bears the brunt of the sarcoidosis onslaught is the lung.
Lung involvement brings with it breathing troubles, cough, fever and fatigue. Lymph node sarcoidosis causes node enlargement, and the nodes most frequently targeted are the ones in the chest at the root of the lungs and the ones in the neck. Sarcoidosis of the eye can greatly affect vision and can lead to blindness. Painful, red skin bumps are a sarcoidosis sign. They often break out on the skin of the shins.
The picture I've painted sounds awful, and sarcoidosis can be a truly awful illness. However, some people have such mild symptoms they don't know they have the illness.
The overall prognosis for patients is good. More than half get over the illness with no or mild organ disturbance. A significant number have to contend with an illness that stays active for a long time or that recurs time and again. For about 5 percent, it's a lethal disease.
Treatment is with prednisone, one of the cortisone drugs. Since many have a spontaneous recovery, it's often difficult to know when to treat or when to wait for it to leave on its own, as it can do. There are medicines other than prednisone that are used when prednisone doesn't suppress the illness.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I am writing about the person whose 87-year-old father has an irregular heartbeat and has to take Coumadin. You said there is not a better medicine for dissolving blood clots. I took myself off Coumadin and started taking nattokinase. I don't think you should publish this letter, because I don't want anyone else to do the same. - C.Z.
ANSWER: I don't want anyone else to substitute nattokinase for Coumadin either, and I think you ought to reconsider your stand. Coumadin doesn't dissolve clots. It prevents them. Nattokinase is an enzyme extracted from natto - a Japanese dish made from boiled soybeans. It can dissolve clots. However, it's effectiveness in preventing clots in humans isn't known. Coumadin's effectiveness has been demonstrated. Blood thinning is too serious an issue to fool around with anything but a medicine with proven results.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I am a teacher who is head of a children's camp during the summer. Before I took this job, one of the campers had appendicitis, and it went unrecognized. I don't want a repeat of that. How does one tell if someone has appendicitis? - B.M.
ANSWER: Appendicitis is the result of a blockage of the hollow core of the appendix. That structure hangs from the first part of the colon and looks like a slender worm, measuring, on average, 3.5 inches (9 cm) in length. The obstruction of the core can be caused by a hard piece of stool or an enlargement of an adjacent lymph node. Bacteria multiply in the blocked appendix, which then swells, and the swelling cuts off its blood supply. If action is not taken somewhat rapidly, the appendix can burst and spill bacteria into the abdominal cavity - a dangerous situation.
Pain in the area of the navel or in the part of the abdomen between the navel and the breastbone is the first symptom of an inflamed appendix. As the hours go by, the pain travels down to the lower right side of the abdomen. Coughing or sneezing increases the pain. The child or adult might vomit. Body temperature is slightly elevated. A trick that aids in diagnosis is to ask the person to raise his right leg while you apply counterforce to stop the upward motion. That maneuver temporarily magnifies the pain.
You shouldn't try or be forced to try to make the diagnosis. Surgeons who have spent a lifetime examining possible appendicitis patients are often mistaken in their diagnosis. Appendicitis can present in a myriad of bewildering ways. Lab tests help a doctor reach the diagnosis and, if doubt remains, a CT scan can usually resolve the doubt.
It's not good for a hospital or a doctor to be correct 100 percent of the time in making this diagnosis. If an institution is right every time, that's an indication that some appendicitis cases are being missed. It's much better to remove a few normal appendixes than to miss a few inflamed ones. If you suspect that one of your campers has appendicitis, get the child to a hospital as quickly as possible.
Dr. Donohue regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but he will incorporate them in his column whenever possible.

Abstract: A. That's not my deal. But oysters are loaded with zinc that increases testosterone, and chocolate has phenylethylamine, which is the same thing that flows through our veins when we're in love. You're going to find that the ingredients in "InterCourses" are fresh fruits and fresh vegetables and the seafoods, the things that are loaded with vitamins and minerals that are going to help you perform better, have more stamina and energy. You're feeding your body with good fuels. A. I couldn't say one way or the other. There are cat people and dog people. There's savory and there's sweet. I'm a savory, and my boyfriend's a sweet, but it's never been a problem. It's what makes the world go round. Opposites attract, even in the kitchen. A. One of the recipes in the book is the grapefruit and ginger-mint syrup. I love the beautiful color of the ruby red grapefruit. I'm a color girl. I'm doing some TV segments so I'm saying, "Let's do the grapefruit. It'll just look pink and pretty and beautiful," so I do think that's important.

Full text: In 1997 Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge published "InterCourses: An Aphrodisiac Cookbook" and raised eyebrows around the country. Now, 10 years later, they've updated that book with more recipes and more of the art that raised most of those eyebrows.
Hopkins agreed to spend a few minutes visiting about the subject of cooking and romance and all that those can entail.
Q. Do you believe there are aphrodisiacs?
A. When I first started out - we did the book on a whim - I didn't. But now, after 10 years and doing the recipes and having so many people have so many fun, fabulous experiences with the recipes, I think they do (exist). My definition of aphrodisiacs is twofold.
The innate sensuality of the food itself. The artichoke that you spread the leaves apart and you see greens and yellows and purples and whites. It's just really beautiful and you pluck it leaf by leaf. It's kind of playing hard to get with the prickly choke and the little thorns on the petals.
It's also the act of cooking for somebody else or with somebody else. You take the time to slow down. To turn off the television. You turn off the cell phones, and you share a meal. There's an intimacy. You're nourishing your body, but you're also nourishing each other through conversation and attention.
Q. That's anecdotal evidence. Have you found any science to support the effectiveness of aphrodisiacs?
A. That's not my deal. But oysters are loaded with zinc that increases testosterone, and chocolate has phenylethylamine, which is the same thing that flows through our veins when we're in love. You're going to find that the ingredients in "InterCourses" are fresh fruits and fresh vegetables and the seafoods, the things that are loaded with vitamins and minerals that are going to help you perform better, have more stamina and energy. You're feeding your body with good fuels.
Q. Is there a reason the book is more heavily weighted toward vegetables over meats?
A. It's just that those particular foods are just naturally beautiful on the plate. Asparagus is a phallic symbol. Historically people thought if something looked like something else, it would aid that something else. But one reason I have them in the book is because you don't have to do anything to them to make them taste wonderful. Throw asparagus in a hot pan with a little olive oil and salt and pepper, and it gets just a little browned on the outside and still a little crispy on the inside, yet tender. I love that. You let the food do the work for you. Let it shine.
Q. Do you find some foods convey sex while others convey love or romance?
A. Honey would convey to me sex. But it is an anti-lubricant. All the words you think about to describe honey are some of the same words you would use to describe sex, so there's something about it. As far as romance, I love the scent of things. Like rosemary. A little goes a long way. You put one sprig of it in your braising liquid, and it flavors the entire dish. It's got that kind of warm and comforting kind of thing, where chile peppers you think of as hot and spicy and gets you going.
Q. Since you brought up spicy food, would you say spicy food has a more profound effect than a sweet dish?
A. I couldn't say one way or the other. There are cat people and dog people. There's savory and there's sweet. I'm a savory, and my boyfriend's a sweet, but it's never been a problem. It's what makes the world go round. Opposites attract, even in the kitchen.
Q. Would cooking naked provide inspiration?
A. It would either inspire or ... who knows what would happen? One of the things I think is fun about the images in "InterCourses" is that those are regular people off the streets of Memphis. You can reproduce a lot of those things at home. Like the alcohol (photo). Imagine if you come home and your partner is there on the bed with a flute of champagne between her toes. If that doesn't faze you, it's going to take more than food to get things going for you. I think (cooking naked) could be an invitation for fun, but be careful of the hot grease. The splattering can be a problem.
Q. What about eating with our fingers?
A. That's super important. There's an asparagus (recipe) where you just blanch the asparagus and have a little prosciutto, put some goat cheese on it and wrap it up. Drizzle it with a little bit of vinaigrette.
It's a great way to combine eating with the intimacy and sensuality of your shared relationship. There's something about breaking out of that (daily) mold and doing something unexpected that just wakes up a relationship and injects it with a fresh shot of fun or sex or romance or whatever it is you're in the mood for.
Q. Do you think some food colors are more apt to advance the cause?
A. One of the recipes in the book is the grapefruit and ginger-mint syrup. I love the beautiful color of the ruby red grapefruit. I'm a color girl. I'm doing some TV segments so I'm saying, "Let's do the grapefruit. It'll just look pink and pretty and beautiful," so I do think that's important.
Q. The art is exquisite. What were the inspirations?
A. Randall was living in Texas at the time, and I was living in Memphis. I was doing research to see which foods we wanted to cover that had ever been considered aphrodisiacs. So we picked our favorite ones out of that list and would literally take an ingredient and over the phone sit there and talk about it. "How about a bustier of pine nuts?" The avocado is one of my most favorites. It's just so striking. The curves of her body and the curves of the avocado so perfectly mimic each other.
Q. If you were going to seduce someone from the past, who would it be and what would you serve?
A. I spent a summer in France and I met this guy. I never had the opportunity to cook for him. I was in college, and we would meet out on the steps of wherever in Paris. I would love to make for him the country biscuits with the strawberry-Grand Marnier sauce with whipped cream. There's nothing more quintessentially Southern to me than a perfectly, amazing, steamy, crispy hot biscuit. And then, with the Grand Marnier strawberry sauce drizzled over the top, it's such a beautiful red color, and then the dollop of whipped cream. What a wonderful set of flavors in your mouth. I think it would make him smile, and that would just be nice. I could see myself doing it right now.

Abstract: Us - the "Reading Rainbow" and "3-2-1 Contact!" kids, the ones who grew up spoonfed "self esteem" - we have a different attitude. We know 1.5 bathrooms and a white picket fence don't buy happiness. We don't just want "a job." We want to be unique and find happiness. And we know we'll have to make choices: free time and poverty, riches and soul-killing commercialism, middle-of-the-road sacrifices for middle-of-the-road pay. How do you figure it out? Older folk might call us "whiney" and "lazy" and say we're "making excuses" for our unhappiness and high expectations. But if that's true, it's true of most of us. So says Abby Wilner, who wrote a book about our plight in 2004 called "The Quarterlife Crisis." "At the time I thought there was something wrong with me," Wilner says. "Gradually I realized I was not the only one disappointed with the 'real world.'" Now that she's out of crisis mode and feeling slightly more stable, Wilner says she tells 20-somethings "to embrace the unpredictability that comes with life after school. I think that would have been more helpful to me than simply being told "The world is your oyster" and "Go out and chase your wildest dreams!"'I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all.'

Full text: A college friend of mine made enough for a BMW two years after graduation, courtesy Wall Street. My penniless and starving friends and I pitied him - he had no life.
Another pal (who buys Jimmy Choos and has a maid) says she envies me for having a job that doesn't require me to give up my soul for the corporation. I say I envy her ability to eat.
This was supposed to be a story about how to get a job these days, precipitated by the plight of an editor's son, who spent part of this winter searching for meaningful work online. (See their stories.)
A different editor, also from a generation or two back, wasn't grasping the concept of "meaningful work" when it comes to young people. "When I graduated, I couldn't wait to get out of the house - I'd take anything I could get," he said.
You'd sell your soul to the corporation? Give up your freedom for a paycheck?
Lots of us - Generations X and Y - grew up watching our parents work diligently toward the American dream from 8-8, heads down, mouths shut, only really living on weekends and those two weeks vacation every year on the promise of an early retirement and a good life for us.
But us - the "Reading Rainbow" and "3-2-1 Contact!" kids, the ones who grew up spoonfed "self esteem" - we have a different attitude. We know 1.5 bathrooms and a white picket fence don't buy happiness. We don't just want "a job." We want to be unique and find happiness. And we know we'll have to make choices: free time and poverty, riches and soul-killing commercialism, middle-of-the-road sacrifices for middle-of-the-road pay. How do you figure it out?
We come at it from different directions, but it's no secret many of us are having a hard time finding our way. Cuz unfortunately, reality can really suck.You can't get there from here.
Morgan Dorsey wants to run a summer camp someday. She works part-time as a lifeguard, now. Chris Meyer wants to work doing business-psych. He graduated with a psych degree and works in loan servicing. Halyane Grayver wants to teach special ed and Carrie Blanchard wants to devote her time to art: Both work a restaurant.
All four are happy with their lives as they are now. But none are exactly sure how they're going to get where they want to go. Because, it seems, you can't get "there" from "here."
"For me, there's a big gap between what I want to do ideally and what I need to do to get to it," Meyer says.
That's if you have a clue what you want to do in the first place.It's not just you.
Older folk might call us "whiney" and "lazy" and say we're "making excuses" for our unhappiness and high expectations. But if that's true, it's true of most of us. So says Abby Wilner, who wrote a book about our plight in 2004 called "The Quarterlife Crisis."
"I felt completely unprepared for the challenges I faced," she says, "such as the catch-22 of needing experience to get experience. I thought my degree would be enough to get my foot in the door. I was living back at home with my parents, and temping while I looked for something more permanent." She did some research and found that lots of other "kids" were in the same boat - looking for "a life," completely unable to find it. She calls it the Quarterlife Crisis.
"At the time I thought there was something wrong with me," Wilner says. "Gradually I realized I was not the only one disappointed with the 'real world.'" Now that she's out of crisis mode and feeling slightly more stable, Wilner says she tells 20-somethings "to embrace the unpredictability that comes with life after school. I think that would have been more helpful to me than simply being told "The world is your oyster" and "Go out and chase your wildest dreams!"'I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all.'
Recognize that? It's the last line of the refrain of Three Days Grace's "Pain," which has been screaming from stations all over recently. The sentiment - I'd rather feel something than be secure and numb - seems to figure into a lot of our career moves. From the folks who do nothing but work to attain either cash or a dream job, to the ones taking pay cuts or jettisoning their dreams in order to have a "life," we're going to control our own destinies.
Take Grayver, for example. While she's got rather lofty aspirations, for now she's not pushing herself toward a "respectable" career because working at Gritty's gives her the ability to live how she wants.
"I like what I do now," says Grayver, 24. "It's funner, and I make more money now than I would being a teacher. And the hours are better."
Starbucks Manager Amanda Paquette, 27, has a degree in culinary arts, and once dreamed of chefing, catering or becoming a food critic. But she veered away from those plans - at least for now - because her current job lets her live the kind of life she wants. "That was one of the main reasons why I chose to come to Starbucks. It's a much better lifestyle," she says.So were does that lead us?
Up next week: Some hope for the desperate. How to turn a crappy job into something that doesn't make you want to head for the hills every Monday morning.
After that, over the next few weeks we're going to tackle some of the things local career counselors say we need to know about finding, getting and keeping jobs. Like: It's totally not OK to wear a miniskirt to an interview, unless you're applying for a dancing job (ahem). Apparently there are quite a few folks out there who haven't been told that before, so says one local interviewer.In coming issues:
You can get there from here: Here's what the experts say.
She did what??? The do's and don'ts of interviewing.
All about spin: You need a resume; here's how to get one.
Local jobs to match any personality.

Refractory hypertension, blood pressure won't budge

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]27 Feb 2007: C11.

Abstract: Take an inventory of the things that you can do to lower your blood pressure. One is weight reduction if it applies to you. Another is a drastic cutback in salt and salty food. Hiking the amount of potassium in your diet lowers blood pressure. Foods with lots of potassium include: baked potato with skin, spinach, bananas, oranges and orange juice, cantaloupe, prunes, lima beans and sweet potatoes. A diet consisting mostly of fruit, vegetables and low-fat dairy products can also bring down pressure. Thirty minutes of exercise (walking) reduces blood pressure. ANSWER: Elevated blood uric acid precipitates gout attacks. Uric acid rises when the body makes too much of it, when the kidneys get rid of too little of it or when a person eats food that contains too much of it. Actually it's not uric acid in food that's to blame; it's food high in purines. Purines are the precursors of uric acid in the body. People with gout are advised not to eat large quantities of meat. Organ meats - such as liver - are forbidden. All types of seafood are high in purines, so their use has to be minimized. No fruit or vegetable is banned. Low-fat dairy products prevent gout attacks. Drinking two or more glasses of skim milk a day lessens your chances of having an attack.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Will you please discuss refractory hypertension? My doctor has tried everything, but nothing seems to work for me. - C.R.
ANSWER: Refractory hypertension is blood pressure that can't be controlled even when the patient has done all in his or her power to make life changes (such as reducing salt intake) and even when the doctor has prescribed two or three medicines in their full doses.
Take an inventory of the things that you can do to lower your blood pressure. One is weight reduction if it applies to you. Another is a drastic cutback in salt and salty food. Hiking the amount of potassium in your diet lowers blood pressure. Foods with lots of potassium include: baked potato with skin, spinach, bananas, oranges and orange juice, cantaloupe, prunes, lima beans and sweet potatoes. A diet consisting mostly of fruit, vegetables and low-fat dairy products can also bring down pressure. Thirty minutes of exercise (walking) reduces blood pressure.
There are 56 blood pressure medicines. You and your doctor have to work together to find the ones that are best for you. A water pill is almost always part of the medicine regimen. A second and even a third medicine might be necessary.
About 5 percent to 10 percent of people with high blood pressure have what's called secondary hypertension - high blood pressure that comes about because of another process going on. For instance, a narrowed kidney artery, sleep apnea, adrenal gland tumors and some kidney conditions elevate blood pressure. Secondary hypertension often does not respond to medicines. Correcting the underlying problem does lower the pressure.
The blood pressure booklet deals with the causes and treatment of high blood pressure. Readers can order a copy by writing: Dr. Donohue - No. 104, Box 536475, Orlando, FL 38253-6475. Enclose a check or money order (no cash) for $4.75 U.S./$6.75 Can. with the recipient's printed name and address. Please allow four weeks for delivery.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I take allopurinol (Zyloprim) for gout, and it helps me very much. Since I'm on this medicine, can I eat more of the food that has purine in it? How about shellfish? - J.D.
ANSWER: Elevated blood uric acid precipitates gout attacks. Uric acid rises when the body makes too much of it, when the kidneys get rid of too little of it or when a person eats food that contains too much of it. Actually it's not uric acid in food that's to blame; it's food high in purines. Purines are the precursors of uric acid in the body.
In the days before there were effective gout medicines, diet was the only treatment available. Today the diet most gout patients have to put up with is one that previous generations would have found a cakewalk.
People with gout are advised not to eat large quantities of meat. Organ meats - such as liver - are forbidden. All types of seafood are high in purines, so their use has to be minimized. No fruit or vegetable is banned. Low-fat dairy products prevent gout attacks. Drinking two or more glasses of skim milk a day lessens your chances of having an attack.
You want an exact quantity of the forbidden food that you can eat. No one can give you such an estimate. It's a matter of experimenting. If you are willing to endure a possible gout attack, then you can increase your intake of these foods, but you'd better have a heart-to-heart talk with your doctor first. Your blood uric acid is another way to tell if you are eating too many high-purine foods.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I have had GERD for years. If I eat part of a raw apple before retiring, I am never bothered by heartburn. Please print this. - I.J.
ANSWER: OK, I'll have it printed. I thank you for the information, but I'm not sure all of humankind will benefit from it. I don't doubt it works for you, but I have serious doubts that it will work for others.
Dr. Donohue regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but he will incorporate them in his column whenever possible. Readers may write him or request an order form of available health newsletters at P.O. Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Readers may also order health newsletters from www.rbmamall.com

Harold E. Dow, husband of an Auburn native, has been named director and administrator of Prudential Insurance Company's $100,000,000 building project in Boston's Back Bay area.
Dow's wife is the former Phyllis Bickford, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Everett Bickford of 63 Winter St., Auburn.
The 45-year-old insurance executive will administer a 50-story development to be built on the present Boston and Albany Railroad yards. The Northeast headquarters for Prudential, it will be the biggest building owned by the insurance company and the largest in New England.

PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. - A nation already beset by brutal weather got more dismal news Tuesday from Punxsutawney Phil, the furry forecaster who predicted six more weeks of winter.
WASHINGTON - President Reagan will ask Congress next week to cut spending on Medicare and Medicaid by more than $5.1 billion, budget documents revealed Thursday. The spending plan will also tilt the nation's energy policy toward nuclear power, five Democratic congressmen said.
In addition, the budget the president will submit Monday will leave the Environmental Protection Agency without some of the money needed to police hazardous chemicals and clean up dangerous spills, and it could also mean the demise of Amtrak everywhere except the Northeast corridor, the congressmen said.

There's a time when surgery is necessary

Abstract: DEAR DR. [DONOHUE]: I read your article on the differences between calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. My calcium product says "calcium from oyster shell." There's no clue as to whether it is carbonate or citrate. What is this product? - L.B. Care to know another bit of calcium information that confuses everyone? It's about elemental calcium. That's the amount in a calcium preparation that is only calcium. No calcium product comes as pure calcium. If your calcium tablet's weight is given as calcium carbonate, multiply that weight by .4 to obtain the amount of elemental calcium you are getting. If yours is calcium citrate, multiply by .21; if lactate, by .13; if gluconate, by .9. If the label says the weight is calcium, then you don't have to do any multiplication.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: My husband is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs more than 285 pounds. He has been on many supervised diets. He loses a few pounds, but always gains them back and then some.
He has followed the suggestions of many doctors without any success. He exercises as much as he can. I think his weight will kill him. What's your opinion on surgery for weight loss? - G.S.
ANSWER: Obesity has many life-shortening consequences.
It makes a person's body unresponsive to insulin and leads to diabetes. It can raise blood pressure. It puts a person at a high risk for a heart attack. It often deposits fat in the liver, which might then progress to liver cirrhosis. It's a true illness.
Some people, in spite of honest efforts to lose weight, cannot do so. There is much that needs to be learned about obesity. Newly discovered hormones have roles that are poorly understood.
Leptin, for example, is a hormone that curbs appetite. Ghrelin (GRELL-in) is another hormone that stimulates hunger. How they influence weight gain needs explanation.
If a person has a body mass index greater than 30, that makes the person obese. If he or she has a BMI greater than 40, that person is morbidly obese, and his or her weight is a serious health threat.
Your husband has a BMI greater than 40. A BMI of 40 correlates with about 100 pounds in excess of ideal body weight.
Obesity surgery can be done in a number of ways. One way is making the stomach smaller. Another is to bypass the route of food absorption. A third combines both techniques. And a fourth involves putting an adjustable band around the stomach to make it hold less food.
There can be serious complications of any surgery, including obesity surgery. Bleeding, infections and lung clots are examples. Death has occurred. Those complications give everyone pause.
However, when the consequences of being excessively overweight are balanced against the risks of surgery, surgery usually wins out in these compelling situations. Your husband should consider it.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: My father is 87. He developed an irregular heartbeat, and the doctor now has him on medicine for that as well as the anticoagulant medicine Coumadin. Coumadin requires that he get his blood checked frequently. Isn't there some other medicine that can be used? Running to the lab is a burden for him. - B.L.
ANSWER: I take it that his heartbeat irregularity is atrial fibrillation. Do you understand why he has to take the anticoagulant (blood thinner)? It's to prevent a stroke.
The atria - the upper two heart chambers - are not beating; they're wiggling. Blood in them stagnates and forms blood clots. Pieces of those clots can break loose and be swept into a brain artery. There they block blood flow through the artery, and the result is a stroke. Coumadin prevents this. No other medicine does a better job.
Your dad has to have his blood checked frequently at first to be sure he isn't getting too much or too little Coumadin.
Too much could cause bleeding. Too little could allow clot formation. Once his blood tests stabilize, he will take them less frequently.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: My husband and I would appreciate your answering some questions about what happened to our son.
He was fine one day. The next day he was covered with a rash. Our doctor said he needed immediate hospitalization for Henoch-Schonlein purpura. We don't understand what caused it. - M.G.
ANSWER: This is an illness that mostly strikes between the ages of 2 and 8. It results from blood vessel inflammation caused by the immune system.
A common respiratory infection like the sniffles or a strep throat can be the trigger that causes the immune system to inflame blood vessels.
Along with a skin rash - which eventually turns into purple bruises (purpura) - kidneys, intestines and joints also come under the immune assault. The child becomes quite sick.
Even though this condition is serious, the prognosis for a full recovery is good for most children.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I read your article on the differences between calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. My calcium product says "calcium from oyster shell." There's no clue as to whether it is carbonate or citrate. What is this product? - L.B.
ANSWER: Calcium that comes from oyster shells is calcium carbonate. Coral calcium is also calcium carbonate.
Care to know another bit of calcium information that confuses everyone? It's about elemental calcium. That's the amount in a calcium preparation that is only calcium. No calcium product comes as pure calcium.
Calcium always comes with a twin - carbonate, citrate, lactate or gluconate. What users want to know is the amount of calcium they're taking. They don't care to know or need to know the total amount of the entire compound - calcium carbonate.
Some manufactures give the compound information, but I don't know why. It serves only to muddle people.
If your calcium tablet's weight is given as calcium carbonate, multiply that weight by .4 to obtain the amount of elemental calcium you are getting. If yours is calcium citrate, multiply by .21; if lactate, by .13; if gluconate, by .9. If the label says the weight is calcium, then you don't have to do any multiplication.

Abstract: DEAR ABBY: The letter you printed on Aug. 30 from that nurse who wants to change careers after only one year could have been written by me. I became a nurse in 2000. While I loved the intellectual stimulation and fulfillment of being a skilled and compassionate nurse, dealing with the "other nurses and the environment" was an entirely different matter. DEAR ABBY: "[Susan] in St. Louis" has many ways she can use her nursing training. If she likes hospital work, among the specialties she might try are: obstetrics, pediatrics, intensive care and dialysis. If she doesn't like hospital work, there is school nursing, which includes teaching, screening for various problems like scoliosis, as well as first aid. There is also industrial nursing, where you work for a private company. In addition, there is research, writing for journals, flight nursing, IV therapy, case management, holistic, forensic, home health, nurse-anesthetist, nurse-practitioner, and many other options. Once you become a nurse, the world is your oyster. I know of few other careers that offer so much variety. - VETERAN NURSE OF 24 YEARS

Full text: DEAR ABBY: The letter you printed on Aug. 30 from that nurse who wants to change careers after only one year could have been written by me. I became a nurse in 2000. While I loved the intellectual stimulation and fulfillment of being a skilled and compassionate nurse, dealing with the "other nurses and the environment" was an entirely different matter.
There's a saying in nursing that "Nurses like to eat their young." While it doesn't seem logical that experienced nurses would sabotage younger ones, it does happen - more frequently than you might think.
I finally decided to change careers after only five years in the field. But then, I live in a small town. If I still lived in the large city I moved from three years ago, I'd have simply changed employers or gone into a different type of nursing. Unfortunately, there are no such options here.
More and more nurses are opting for career changes, Abby. It's a shame, too, considering the nursing shortage in our country. Your advice to "Susan in St. Louis" was right on. Living where she does, she's bound to find something better suited for her than where she is now - or maybe she should switch to a different department in the same hospital. - BEEN THERE, DONE THAT IN VIRGINIA
DEAR BTDT: With the shortage of skilled nurses in this country, your departure from the field is everybody's loss. Until I read your letter, I had never heard the expression "Nurses eat their young." But it was echoed by a surprising number of nurses who responded to that letter. Like you, they wanted to remind "Susan" that other opportunities are available in this specialized and important field. Read on:
DEAR ABBY: "Susan in St. Louis" has many ways she can use her nursing training. If she likes hospital work, among the specialties she might try are: obstetrics, pediatrics, intensive care and dialysis. If she doesn't like hospital work, there is school nursing, which includes teaching, screening for various problems like scoliosis, as well as first aid. There is also industrial nursing, where you work for a private company.
In addition, there is research, writing for journals, flight nursing, IV therapy, case management, holistic, forensic, home health, nurse-anesthetist, nurse-practitioner, and many other options. Once you become a nurse, the world is your oyster. I know of few other careers that offer so much variety. - VETERAN NURSE OF 24 YEARS
DEAR ABBY: Please tell "Susan in St. Louis" that with just a little more training, she can use her skill as a nurse to help attorneys understand and read medical records. She will do the same job as a normal paralegal, but she'll be working mainly in medical malpractice and personal injury areas, reading medical records. - LEGAL SECRETARY IN OHIO
DEAR ABBY: There are unlimited opportunities for that young woman to apply her nursing/medical education to other careers. Plenty of drug and medical companies would welcome someone with nurse's training and experience for positions in clinical testing protocols, data review, on-site visits, customer support and interaction with medical professionals.
Many years ago, I graduated with a high school biology/science teaching degree, only to find after one year of teaching that I hated it. I have used my education to do something I could have never imagined: I have been successfully consulting to domestic and international medical device companies for more than 20 years. - CAROLANN IN LILBURN, GA.
Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips. Write Dear Abby at www.DearAbby.com or P.O. Box 69440, Los Angeles, CA 90069.

Don't worry, men: Evolution shows you're still needed

Abstract: You divide your genes in half to make sperm, so half your sperm get a bad copy of the BSS genes. The same thing happens in your eggs. That means one of every four of your offspring will get two bad BSS genes and come out banjo savants. And if they're fertile, all their offspring will be banjo savants. Genetic diversity also keeps the male killifish in business despite the challenge of having to mate with hermaphrodites - and mean ones at that. When you put killifish together in a tank, the hermaphrodites tend to eat the males, says biologist John Elder of Valdosta State University in Georgia. in the wild, some obviously mate and escape, at least in Belize, where DNA tests show that males inject much-needed genetic diversity into the pool. For years, the scientists weren't finding males among Florida's killifish, but genetic tests conducted in the last few months reveal the Floridian fish are too genetically diverse to be having sex just with themselves.

Full text: Science may have found an answer to that question made famous by Maureen Dowd: Are men necessary? If other creatures are anything to go by, men are essential to keeping our species healthy, and would still be necessary even if women started making their own sperm.
That's more or less what happened to the male clam shrimp, a puddle and pond dweller that thrives in all continents except Antarctica. One day millions of years ago a mutant female started producing both sperm and eggs; that mutation spread until all the females were replaced by hermaphrodites. You'd think that would spell doom for the males.
Hermaphrodites also dominate one of our fellow vertebrates, a swamp dweller called a killifish. And yet male killifish crop up here and there.
Are these males getting any sex or in any way contributing to the gene pool? Are they necessary?
An even more serious question is why all animals don't become hermaphrodites, with its obvious perk of increased sexual opportunity. If you want to colonize new ponds or tide pools, say, it's advantageous to be able to mate with anyone of your species, including, in a pinch, yourself.
It works well for some corals, barnacles, shellfish, worms and many plants. But there are drawbacks.
"In some ways it is a matter of 'jack of all trades is a master of none,' " says Stephen Weeks, an evolutionary ecologist from the University of Akron, Ohio. The hermaphroditic shrimp he studies, for example, can't mate with each other. Only the males come equipped with a clawlike clasper for positioning the hermaphrodite so its eggs meet his sperm at the right time.
Without the males, the shrimp are stuck mating with themselves, says Weeks, and that's a problem. "That's often associated with something called inbreeding depression which is, basically... have you seen Deliverance?"
(In the classic '70s film, it's implied that inbreeding led to defects suffered by a mute banjo-playing savant.)
You can't get more incestuous than sex with yourself. Unlike asexual reproduction, which also occurs in nature and creates genetically identical clones, sex with yourself can double up copies of deleterious genes.
Say you're a hermaphrodite and you carry a gene for banjo savant syndrome, or BSS. You need two copies of the mutant BSS gene to have the disease and your cells carry just one, plus a normal copy.
But you divide your genes in half to make sperm, so half your sperm get a bad copy of the BSS genes. The same thing happens in your eggs. That means one of every four of your offspring will get two bad BSS genes and come out banjo savants. And if they're fertile, all their offspring will be banjo savants.
Preventing this kind of thing is the job of the male clam shrimp, and apparently has been for some time. All of the more than 30 known species of this creature mix hermaphrodites and males, suggesting they inherited this sexual strategy from a common ancestor before they diverged. And the fossil record indicates that was more than 24 million years ago.
Genetic diversity also keeps the male killifish in business despite the challenge of having to mate with hermaphrodites - and mean ones at that. When you put killifish together in a tank, the hermaphrodites tend to eat the males, says biologist John Elder of Valdosta State University in Georgia.
But in the wild, some obviously mate and escape, at least in Belize, where DNA tests show that males inject much-needed genetic diversity into the pool. For years, the scientists weren't finding males among Florida's killifish, but genetic tests conducted in the last few months reveal the Floridian fish are too genetically diverse to be having sex just with themselves.
The hermaphrodite fish might be mating with one another, Elder said, but as a general rule when they meet they "go after each other like piranhas." It might be that males not yet spotted are mixing up the genes.
In which case those male killifish, like male humans, are indeed necessary.

Hemorrhoids treatable without surgery

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]20 Sep 2006: C15.

Abstract: External hemorrhoids are close to the anal opening. This is an area with many nerves, so external hemorrhoids can be most painful, especially when a clot forms in one of the hemorrhoidal veins. Evacuation of the clot can often be accomplished in the doctor's office. Keeping stool soft by increasing dietary fiber or by using products such as Metamucil or Citrucel is both treatment and prevention. Soaking in a tub of warm water is another way of soothing and shrinking external hemorrhoids. The extent of their drop is graded from 1 to 4, with 4 being a hemorrhoid that protrudes from the anus and cannot be pushed back in. Grades 1 and 2 internal hemorrhoids can often be treated with rubber bands placed around their base. In about a week, the hemorrhoid sloughs off. Surgical stapling is suitable for many hemorrhoids, and grades 1, 2 and 3 hemorrhoids respond well to it. It sounds barbaric, but it is actually not so painful. The doctor pushes the hemorrhoid back into its normal position and tacks it there with staples. Coagulation with infrared light can cure small grade 1 and 2 internal hemorrhoids. Sclerotherapy, the injection of a liquid that causes the hemorrhoidal vein to collapse, takes care of grades 1, 2 and 3 hemorrhoids. Grade 4 hemorrhoids usually require surgery.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I read your article on hemorrhoids. Do you have more information on nonsurgical treatments for them? - D.H.
ANSWER: Hemorrhoids are cushions of tissue that contain blood vessels, muscle fibers and filler material. You can think of them as varicose veins and won't be too far off base.
The position of hemorrhoids and how far they have dropped determine what procedure is most appropriate for them.
External hemorrhoids are close to the anal opening. This is an area with many nerves, so external hemorrhoids can be most painful, especially when a clot forms in one of the hemorrhoidal veins. Evacuation of the clot can often be accomplished in the doctor's office. Keeping stool soft by increasing dietary fiber or by using products such as Metamucil or Citrucel is both treatment and prevention. Soaking in a tub of warm water is another way of soothing and shrinking external hemorrhoids.
Internal hemorrhoids are located a bit farther up the anus. There are fewer nerves in this area, so internal hemorrhoids are less painful, unless they have a clot and have dropped far downward. They can drop so much that they protrude from the anal opening.
The extent of their drop is graded from 1 to 4, with 4 being a hemorrhoid that protrudes from the anus and cannot be pushed back in. Grades 1 and 2 internal hemorrhoids can often be treated with rubber bands placed around their base. In about a week, the hemorrhoid sloughs off. Surgical stapling is suitable for many hemorrhoids, and grades 1, 2 and 3 hemorrhoids respond well to it. It sounds barbaric, but it is actually not so painful. The doctor pushes the hemorrhoid back into its normal position and tacks it there with staples. Coagulation with infrared light can cure small grade 1 and 2 internal hemorrhoids. Sclerotherapy, the injection of a liquid that causes the hemorrhoidal vein to collapse, takes care of grades 1, 2 and 3 hemorrhoids. Grade 4 hemorrhoids usually require surgery.
Not all of these techniques are available everywhere, and not all are suitable for every hemorrhoid problem.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I read and hear much about hepatitis B and C, but little about A. Why? I had infectious hepatitis when I was a child. My doctor says that it was hepatitis A. Does this kind of hepatitis stay with you for life? - A.M.
ANSWER: Hepatitis A is very much with us. It doesn't get as much publicity as hepatitis B and C, because hepatitis A does not stay with a person for life. It's the kind of hepatitis that comes about from food contaminated with the virus and from shellfish that live in polluted waters. Person-to-person spread is another route of transmission.
The initial illness of all the hepatitis viruses is similar, with loss of appetite, vomiting, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, headache, skin and eye yellowing and a rise in temperature. People can be very sick with hepatitis A, but death is quite rare and chronic infection doesn't happen. There is a vaccine for hepatitis A, and those who are at risk of infection are urged to obtain it -- travelers going to countries where hepatitis A is prevalent, military personnel and people with chronic liver disease, to mention a few. The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control recommends that all infants older than 1 receive the vaccine.
Hepatitis is a common and misunderstood illness. The hepatitis booklet deals with hepatitis A, B and C. Readers can obtain a copy by writing: Dr. Donohue - No. 503, Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Enclose a check or money order (no cash) for $4.75 U.S./$6.75 Can. with the recipient's printed name and address. Please allow four weeks for delivery.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I am 33 and have a ruptured back disk. Would an operation stop me from participating in sports? - E.M.
ANSWER: If you follow hockey, you know that the number of professional players who have had back surgery for ruptured disks is quite high. They continue to play professional hockey after their operations. There's no reason you cannot play sports after such surgery.

Food allergy not to blame for most stomach upsets

Abstract: ANSWER: There's a big difference between food allergy and food intolerance. An allergy is due to a reaction that takes place under the direction of the immune system. An allergen incites the production of antibodies, an immune system function. When allergen and antibody collide, the body releases a batch of chemicals that cause typical food-allergy symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps. You determine food allergy by the symptoms that the food brings on and by successfully putting an end to the symptoms by avoidance of the involved food. It's true that avoidance is the treatment for food intolerance, too, but the symptoms of food intolerance are not as florid as are those of a true allergy. Skin tests are also available for detection of food allergies, and so are some blood tests. DEAR DR. [DONOHUE]: I am a 52-year-old woman in a southern city about 60 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. For five years I have been getting bad staph infections. Often they are very large boils that ooze pus. This year I have had two episodes in three months. I had to be hospitalized for the first one. The staph are antibiotic-resistant.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: How do you know if you're allergic to food? I think I am. I believe I am allergic to peas and ice cream, but no other dairy products. Both of them make me sick to my stomach, and I often feel like throwing up after eating them, but I never do. Is this a food allergy? - L.C.
ANSWER: There's a big difference between food allergy and food intolerance. An allergy is due to a reaction that takes place under the direction of the immune system. An allergen incites the production of antibodies, an immune system function. When allergen and antibody collide, the body releases a batch of chemicals that cause typical food-allergy symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps.
Those symptoms are different from the symptoms of hay fever, but hay fever symptoms are due to the release of the same chemicals. Intolerance is a person's unique reaction to a particular food without involving an antibody reaction.
Infrequently, food allergies cause hives and swelling. Most infrequently, they can give rise to a dangerous reaction, with great difficulty breathing and a drop in blood pressure. This kind of reaction is an emergency.
Milk, eggs, peanuts and other nuts are the foods that cause most allergic reactions in children. For adults, it's fish, shellfish, nuts and peanuts that are most involved in food allergies.
You determine food allergy by the symptoms that the food brings on and by successfully putting an end to the symptoms by avoidance of the involved food. It's true that avoidance is the treatment for food intolerance, too, but the symptoms of food intolerance are not as florid as are those of a true allergy. Skin tests are also available for detection of food allergies, and so are some blood tests.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I am a 52-year-old woman in a southern city about 60 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. For five years I have been getting bad staph infections. Often they are very large boils that ooze pus. This year I have had two episodes in three months. I had to be hospitalized for the first one. The staph are antibiotic-resistant.
Would the city's changing from ground water to treated river water be a factor in this? We have just done this. Several residents of my city are having this problem. - D.G.
ANSWER: It's difficult to almost impossible to implicate treated water as being the source of a staph infection. They're usually passed from one person to the next.
Recurrent staph skin infections show themselves as furuncles or boils. They're hard to eradicate.
Have all infected family members use separate towels and washcloths. Everyone in the family must change clothes daily, including underwear. Have the family wash with an antibacterial soap, like Hibiclens. This ritual should go until two months have elapsed from the last staph infection.
Bactroban ointment applied to the lower third of the inner nostrils can get rid of staph that often find a sanctuary there. From that site, they can be spread to other places in the body. People inoculate themselves with the germ.
Even though your staph germ is called resistant, there are antibiotics that can still attack it, so you aren't left completely defenseless.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I have enjoyed reading your column for years. But now something annoys me.
You imply, more and more often, that the first and maybe only solution to any medical problem is the use of drugs - not diet, not exercise, not attitude, but drugs.
The drug mentality is a dangerous infectious disease. I hope you'll be more careful about this. - R.I.
ANSWER: I am pushing too many drugs? I have to check myself. I am in your camp. I firmly believe that the fewer medicines people take the better off they are. However, there are many illnesses, particularly the more serious ones, for which medicines or surgery are the only answers.
I'll keep closer tabs on myself in the future. You do the same. If you find an illness for which I mention a drug and you have a nondrug treatment, let me know, and I'll put that in the paper.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: My son is 16 years old, 6 feet tall, weighs 160 pounds and has gynecomastia. It is only in his left breast, and he has had it for about 14 months. We have been to numerous doctors, including an endocrinologist. No hormone abnormalities were evident. Some doctors say it will clear up on its own. Others say surgery will be necessary. We haven't gotten an answer to "Why does it hurt?" and his nipple is very irritated. What is your opinion of options? - L.T.
ANSWER: During puberty, close to two-thirds of boys experience enlargement of one or both breasts - gynecomastia (GUY-nuh-coe-MASS-tee-uh). Some have concurrent breast pain and nipple irritation. Cold compresses can often take care of the nipple irritation, and simple analgesics like Tylenol can ease the pain.
It happens because during puberty there is an imbalance in the ratio of male to female hormones - a very normal condition. A slight excess of estrogen, the female hormone, causes breast growth. It takes two or more years for the growth to subside.
Antiestrogen medicines like raloxifene can reverse the effects of estrogen, but it takes a while before results are seen.
If your son is embarrassed by the growth or if it's inhibiting his life, then I would opt for the immediate solution of surgical removal of the tissue by a skilled surgeon. The scars from such an operation are not seen, and the recovery is relatively fast. I would let the young man make his own decision about surgery.
A few illnesses lead to gynecomastia. An overactive thyroid gland, trouble with the pituitary gland and a decreased production of testosterone are examples. Liver cirrhosis, kidney failure and aging are other causes. Your son has been seen by a number of doctors, and he has none of these problems. He has the kind of gynecomastia that is all but expected at his age.

Full text: Dear Sun Spots: You do such a great job and have obtained lots of answers for many people, including myself. Can you please help me out again?
A little more than a year ago, I asked if you could find a recipe for a seafood recipe that had been on a cooking channel. You did find it and printed it. Well, I have misplaced it. Could you possibly find it and rerun it? This time I will put it in the computer, like I should have in the first place.
Keep up the great work. - Fern Bosse, Poland.
Answer: Sun Spots published the following in the March 25, 2005, column:
Savannah seafood gumbo
Ingredients: 1/4 cup oil, 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 2 cups onion, chopped, 1 cup green bell pepper, chopped, 1 cup celery, diced, 3 large garlic cloves, minced, 4 cups chicken broth, 1 tablespoon chicken base, 3 cups water, 2 bay leaves, 11/2 teaspoons dried thyme, 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1/3 cup dried parsley, 1 teaspoon lemon pepper, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 2 teaspoons house seasoning (recipe follows), 2 tablespoons soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce, 1 (141/2-ounce) can diced tomatoes seasoned with garlic, basil, and oregano or 2 cups fresh diced tomatoes, 4 cups sliced Cajun-style fresh link sausage, 4 cups cut okra (fresh or frozen), 2 cups oysters and liquor, 1/2 pound crabmeat, 11/2 pounds fresh peeled shrimp, 3 cups bay scallops, file powder.
Method: In a large pot combine oil and flour. Cook over medium heat stirring constantly until the roux has browned to a light chocolate color. Add onion, pepper, celery and garlic. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly add chicken broth, and chicken base, stirring as you go. Add water, bay leaves, thyme, basil, parsley, lemon pepper, cayenne pepper, house seasoning, soy sauce and tomatoes. Cut sausage into 1/2-inch pieces. Add to pot along with okra. Cover pot and simmer for 1 to 11/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add oysters, crabmeat, shrimp and scallops. Simmer for an additional 15 minutes. Serve over hot buttered rice. Sprinkle with file powder on top of bowl and stir in.
Tip: Add file powder after putting gumbo into individual serving bowls. Adding file into the pot will make the gumbo too thick, as file powder acts as a thickening agent.
House seasoning ingredients and method: 1 cup salt, 1/4 cup black pepper, 1/4 cup garlic powder. Mix ingredients together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months. Yields 11/2 cups.
Dear Sun Spots: What are the symptoms of cataracts? My eye doctor said I have small ones in both eyes. Will that cause my eyes to be scratchy and also give me a headache?
When is Elizabeth Vargas expecting her baby? Is this her first? - No Name, West Bethel.
Answer: According to www.medem.com, common symptoms of cataracts include a painless blurring of vision, glare or light sensitivity, poor night vision, double vision in one eye, needing brighter light to read or fading or yellowing of colors. The amount and pattern of cloudiness within the lens can vary. If the cloudiness is not near the center of the lens, you may not be aware that a cataract is present. But please, Sun Spots would urge you to call your eye doctor to discuss your symptoms. Sun Spots and the column are not medical experts in any way and would caution you and other readers to please consult with your primary care doctors and other medical experts to discuss your individual concerns, symptoms and more.
Regarding your second question, according to an item posted online at The Philadelphia Inquirer's Web site (www.philly.com), Vargas and husband singer-songwriter Marc Cohn are expecting their second child in late August. The Mercury News (www.mercurynews.com) also notes that the couple has a son, Zachary, 3, and Cohn has two children - Max, 14, and Emily, 11 - from a previous marriage.

Are popular osteoporosis medicines dangerous?

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]31 July 2006: C15.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/378779179?accountid=10457

Abstract: ANSWER: Many readers have expressed concerns about these medicines. They are the bisphosphonates - Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva (all oral medicines) and two injection preparations, Zometa and Aredia. These drugs slow the resorption of bone, a daily event, as bones are constantly being remodeled. Following resorption, bones are rebuilt, but at older ages the resorption process outpaces the rebuilding process and bones become fragile and osteoporotic. The bisphosphonates are the most effective drugs in combating osteoporosis. They are also effective in restoring bone to which cancer has spread. Cancers of the breast, prostate, lung and kidney often travel to bones and weaken them. Multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, does the same thing. To strengthen cancer-riddled bones, bisphosphonates are given in high doses. Three years ago, an association between bisphosphonates and jaw osteonecrosis was made. Osteonecrosis is death of a section of bone. Since then, other cases have been reported. Most of them - 94 percent in one series - occurred in people treated for bone cancer with high doses of the drugs. Only a few occurred in people treated with oral medicines for osteoporosis. ANSWER: Grapefruit and grapefruit juice block the breakdown of some medicines, so their blood concentration can rise to high levels. You are an example of this not being important. In your case, the increased level has done no harm. Others, however, should not take a chance. The effects of grapefruit and grapefruit juice last for 24 hours, so they shouldn't be eaten if a drug is on the list of affected medicines. When taking those medicines, it's prudent not to eat grapefruit or drink its juice.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Lately, on television, they have been telling women about the terrible side effects to the jawbone that Fosamax and Actonel create. I am sure other readers would like to see your comments. - M.L.
ANSWER: Many readers have expressed concerns about these medicines. They are the bisphosphonates - Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva (all oral medicines) and two injection preparations, Zometa and Aredia. These drugs slow the resorption of bone, a daily event, as bones are constantly being remodeled. Following resorption, bones are rebuilt, but at older ages the resorption process outpaces the rebuilding process and bones become fragile and osteoporotic. The bisphosphonates are the most effective drugs in combating osteoporosis.

Most of them - 94 percent in one series - occurred in people treated for bone cancer with high doses of the drugs. Only a few occurred in people treated with oral medicines for osteoporosis.
Dental surgery and dental infections appear to increase the risk of jaw osteonecrosis. For that reason, it is good practice to have all major dental work performed prior to taking these medicines. Keep in mind that osteoporosis has major complications. Fragile bones are subject to breaking, and hip fractures cause great disability. Osteoporosis so weakens backbones that they cannot support body weight and they become squashed - compression fractures, a most painful condition. I wouldn't hesitate to take bisphosphonates.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I take Lipitor before going to bed and eat grapefruit every morning. The Lipitor information warns "Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice when taking this medicine." I've ignored the warning for 20 years, with no harmful results. I was told there won't be a problem if there are several hours between eating grapefruit and taking the medicine. Right? - D.B.
ANSWER: Grapefruit and grapefruit juice block the breakdown of some medicines, so their blood concentration can rise to high levels. You are an example of this not being important. In your case, the increased level has done no harm. Others, however, should not take a chance. The effects of grapefruit and grapefruit juice last for 24 hours, so they shouldn't be eaten if a drug is on the list of affected medicines. When taking those medicines, it's prudent not to eat grapefruit or drink its juice.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: I have a very slow heartbeat and am told I need a pacemaker. I am dizzy much of the day, and the slow heartbeat is said to be a factor. On the other hand, I take five high-blood-pressure pills a day, and each one clearly states it can cause dizziness. I need someone to clear the confusion on this situation. - J.G.
ANSWER: Ask your doctor if it would be safe to eliminate one or two of your blood pressure medicines for a short time. If you have your own blood pressure monitor, you can keep track of your pressure, and you can see if your dizziness is related to the blood pressure medicine. If you don't have a blood pressure monitor, perhaps a visiting nurse can take your pressure every day when you're off the medicines. A slow heartbeat is another valid explanation for dizziness. Perhaps your EKG shows a malfunction of your heart's natural pacemaker. If so, then you can scratch the blood pressure medicines off the list of possible causes. The decision should be for the pacemaker. Installing a pacemaker is not a stressful operation. You feel quite good right after it's been inserted. Symptoms should disappear immediately.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Something strange has been happening to me. My lips and tongue become swollen in the late evening. They don't do it every night, and they don't itch. I've kept track of what I eat, and there's no apparent relationship between the swelling and any particular food. What's going on? Whom should I see? - R.A.
ANSWER: You describe angioedema. "Angio" refers to blood vessels, and "edema" to swelling. It's much like hives. With hives, blood vessels leak fluid, and the surface of the skin develops a local accumulation of fluid in the familiar hive breakout. Hives itch; angioedema doesn't. With angioedema, the leaky blood vessels are deeper, and fluid spills into the tissues beneath the skin; they swell. That's what's happening to your lips and your tongue.
Angioedema comes about for many of the same reasons that hives do. Allergies are one of those reasons, and food allergies are common offenders. You've done a smart thing to keep a food record. Nuts, fish and shellfish are among the more common food allergens. Medicines are another frequent angioedema cause, and aspirin is near the top of medicine causes. Infections can trigger angioedema. Sinus infections and herpes are often implicated. Pregnancy can bring it on, as can either an underactive or overactive thyroid gland. In a small number of people, cancers such as lymphomas (lymph node cancers) have led to it. In a few instances, heredity is the basis of the swelling. Antihistamines can usually control swelling.
At times, they are used in combination with medicines that lessen stomach acid production, like Tagamet, Zantac and Pepcid. Those work because they have an antihistamine action in addition to their action in suppressing stomach acid. Histamine is one of the body chemicals that cause blood vessel leakage. If, with an outbreak, you have trouble swallowing or breathing, have someone take you to an emergency facility right away. You'll need injectable medicines for quick relief of the swelling. A dermatologist or an allergist can track down the cause for you.

'Pirates' lacks swash, buckle of the original

Author: Rea, Steven

Abstract: "Dead Man's Chest" begins with Bloom's Turner and [Keira Knightley]'s [Swann] being arrested, and threatened with death, for aiding and abetting Capt. [Jack Sparrow] at the end of Part 1. As for Capt. Jack, he makes his reentry in amusing fashion, emerging from a coffin adrift on the ocean. He gets himself to land via a makeshift oar - a skeleton's leg. Jack Sparrow, it seems, owes a debt to Capt. Octo-Man, I mean [Davy Jones], and unless Sparrow can find the key to a chest that guards a mighty secret, he's doomed to eternal damnation. Somehow, Sparrow gets the soon-to-be-wed duo of [Turner] and Swann involved in all this. And then there is the swarthy crew of Jack's vessel, the Black Pearl, ho-ho-ho-ing and a-bottle-of-rum-ing along for the ride.

Full text: Jack Sparrow still sashays like a drunken runway model, all debauched and buccaneer-y. Elizabeth Swann remains more likely to cross swords than exchange ladylike bons mots. And Will Turner continues to look alarmingly like Legolas, the elf knight of "The Lord of the Rings, sans the blond locks and pointy ears.
Yes, Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are back in "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," and, well, would that they were not.
"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," the second installment in the promised trilogy (Parts 2 & 3 were shot concurrently), is a long, tedious and convoluted follow-up to 2003's rollicking high-seas hit "The Curse of the Black Pearl."
To be sure, Depp - sporting gobs of eyeliner and a set of teeth alternately gold and black - gets off a few good lines. And there's a wondrously spectacular swordfight/chase sequence on a runaway waterwheel in the film's final act. But with several ships worth of supporting players from "Curse of the Black Pearl" reassembling for a second tour of duty - plus a freakish troupe of spectral mutant fish people joining the gang (and gangplank) - there are too many characters to keep track of, too many relationships to remember, too many plots to follow.
And it's dark, very dark.
"Dead Man's Chest" begins with Bloom's Turner and Knightley's Swann being arrested, and threatened with death, for aiding and abetting Capt. Sparrow at the end of Part 1. As for Capt. Jack, he makes his reentry in amusing fashion, emerging from a coffin adrift on the ocean. He gets himself to land via a makeshift oar - a skeleton's leg.
It's work to watch where this effects-laden sequel, once again directed by Gore Verbinski, goes next: Sparrow can be briefly found in the company of an island tribe, exchanging jittery, gibberish-y dialogue and threatening to make the captive Mr. Turner something less of a mister. There's a voodoo queen (Naomie Harris) dishing out dire forecasts in a thick patois. There is Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), the sinister and effete English snoot who has it in, it seems, for everybody but himself.
And then there are the crew and captain of the ghost ship the Flying Dutchman: Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a wheezy, supernatural hybrid of human ghost and majorly tentacled sea creature. While the prosthetic effects are something to marvel over, little kids are likely to find Jones and his sailors more than a mite frightening: Imagine an aquarium's worth of finned things partially anthropomorphized, laden with barnacles and pulsating parasites, rising from the depths to sap the souls of the living. Not to mention requiring fine actors like Stellan Skarsgard to deliver their speeches through a mask of fake algae and mollusks.
Jack Sparrow, it seems, owes a debt to Capt. Octo-Man, I mean Davy Jones, and unless Sparrow can find the key to a chest that guards a mighty secret, he's doomed to eternal damnation. Somehow, Sparrow gets the soon-to-be-wed duo of Turner and Swann involved in all this. And then there is the swarthy crew of Jack's vessel, the Black Pearl, ho-ho-ho-ing and a-bottle-of-rum-ing along for the ride.
While Depp hams it up, Knightley and Bloom, together and separately, demonstrate their limits as heartthrob thespians. The actress resorts to flapping her arms and squawking birdlike during a last, antic slapstick swordfest on a beach. For his part, Bloom is just dull.
A winning smile and an English accent can take one only so far in life, and in movies. Both the usually beaming Knightley and her over-hyped leading man seem to expire on camera before this 21/2-hour exercise expires of its own accord.

Full text: BIDDEFORD - Mary L. Rountree, 72, of East Waterboro and formerly of Litchfield, died May 23, at Southern Maine Medical Center.
She was born April 22, 1934, in West Paris, one of three daughters born to Dwight and Sarah (Bolstridge) Libby. She attended local schools and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Maine at Orono.
For more than 30 years, she and her husband Jerry raised their family in Litchfield. She taught English in the Litchfield's schools and was very active within the community.
She was a Little League mom and used her many talents as a seamstress. She made many of the costumes for the school plays and her homemade Halloween costumes were a hit with the neighborhood.
Throughout her life, she was an engaging and positive role model in her community.
Her famous oyster stew brought many to the PTA booth at Litchfield Fair. She listened to the kids, participated in their activities and imparted wisdom to all she met.
She looked for the best in people and never spoke ill of anyone.
She traveled the world with her husband, Jerry, bringing back treasures to all her children and grandchildren. She was an avid and accomplished quilter later in life; as she made each grandchild a quilt for high school graduation.
She would use different themes' and interest to make them a lifetime keepsake.
Survivors include her daughter, Libby Rountree and her husband, Tom Cyr, with whom she made her home in East Waterboro for the past 10 years; three sons and their spouses, Michael and Gail Rountree of Brooklyn, Conn., Stephan and Katie Rountree of Port Matilda, Pa. and Daniel and Kristi Rountree of Litchfield; 10 grandchildren; five great-grandchildren; two sisters, Laurene Webber and Ruth Jones both of Scarborough; several nieces and nephews; and her "adopted children, Bruce and Lori Stackpole."
She was predeceased by her husband, Jerry Rountree in 1999.

Abstract: Only a fair-sized crowd lined Auburn and Lewiston streets to watch the annual Armed Forces Day parade march over a two-mile route through the Twin Cities. Maine National Guard and Army Reserve units rode up the first division of the parade with motorized units drawing a lot of attention from onlookers. Veterans organizations, Boy and Girl Scouts and other groups completed the lineup for a total of 20 marching units. The crack of Edward Little High School band led by strutting white-clad majorettes was the first unit in the parade and was followed by Army and Air Force recruiting service vehicles.25 Years Ago, 1981

Full text: The board of Public Works last night received an offer from Edwin Jackson who wishes to sell 11 acres of land on the Stevens place on East avenue to the city for a sand and gravel pit. The board will confer with Mr. W. S. Libbey in regard to his offer to allow the city the use of his stone crusher if it will build one mile of macadam road every year.
Chicken Wiggle - Miss Helen Bonsey, Ellsworth. Make a cream of one cup milk, one cup cream and two teaspoons flour. Add salt, dash of cayenne and one tablespoon oyster cocktail or catsup. Pour over the chicken cut in bits and add one-half can French peas. Heat thoroughly then add about one-fourth cup of butter. Serve hot on saltines. This is a good chafing dish recipe and is nice for lunch.50 Years Ago, 1956

"We are here to compete and have a good time," remarked Jeff Lever of Scarborough, after leading his team to victory in volleyball and obstacle course competition at the second annual Olympic Wheelchair Games held at Bates College. Lever, a member of Alpha-One, an organization concerned with adaptive living for physically handicapped Americans, was one of 20 handicapped participants in events sponsored by Central Maine Medical Center as part of the hospital's National Hospital Week observance.

Abstract: Prepare pan: Cover an 11-by-16-inch jelly roll pan with aluminum foil. Grease with margarine and sprinkle with a little sugar. Beat egg whites until stiff. Using same (unwashed) beaters, beat egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Add ground walnuts and flour (or matzo meal) and mix to combine. Fold in beaten egg whites with a spoon. Spread in prepared pan and cook at 300 degrees for about 25-30 minutes, until golden and cake springs back at a light touch. Remove from oven. Starting at the short end, roll up both cake and foil to the end of the pan. Let cool, then carefully unroll and spread apricot preserves over the cake. Roll up again, this time without the foil, gently rolling the cake up and off the foil to the end of the pan. Frost with your favorite chocolate icing. ([Vicky Cohen] melts chocolate chips with margarine and a couple tablespoons of water over a gentle heat on the stove; she also sometimes does this in the microwave).

Full text: FARMINGTON - Vicky Cohen loves to cook with her family, especially for celebrations like Passover, a Jewish holiday commemorating the escape of ancient Hebrews from slavery in Egypt.
"It celebrates freedom," explained Cohen. "It's a time to reflect and think about what we are a slave to in our daily lives."
During the week of Passover, "we don't eat anything that has been allowed to rise - no yeast," said Cohen. She finds this restriction actually makes cooking fun, creating the need for a substitute for flour, for example, in matzo, thin, crisp unleavened bread for sandwiches, as well as in cake and other recipes.
A central part of the Passover celebration, food is used as a teaching tool during the service. For example, charoset, a paste made with ground-up walnuts, apples, sweet wine, cinnamon and honey, represents the mortar for brick buildings used by Jewish slaves in Egypt.
Passover is celebrated in the home, with a script telling the Passover story read at the table. "The food sparks an interest in the kids," Cohen said, prompting them to ask why certain foods are eaten.
Cohen's four children range in age from 7 to 15. "We often cook as a family. I've had a lot of fun teaching my kids and my husband. They've become quite comfortable in the kitchen," said Cohen.
She enjoys making matzo pizza or matzo brei, a recipe from her dad that calls for soaking broken matzo in milk and scrambling it with eggs in a skillet. "My kids are good eaters and game for anything, so I love cooking for them," she said.
Cohen and her family follow a kosher diet in which certain foods are forbidden by God. One restriction is that they cannot eat shellfish or anything from a pig. The meat they eat has to be slaughtered in a specific kosher way in accordance with Jewish law, which, Cohen said, is the most humane way.
Cohen is a math consultant. She works in the education department at the University of Maine at Farmington, instructing teachers on how to teach math. "I love the subject - so much of our daily life is based on math," she said.
When Cohen and her family are not cooking or working, they enjoy skiing and kayaking.Walnut Roulade (Chocolate and Apricot Jelly Roll)
(This cake can be made for Passover or any special occasion.)
Ingredients:
5 eggs, separate yolks and whites
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup ground walnuts
5 tablespoons flour (or matzo meal)
1 12-ounce jar of apricot preserves
Frosting:
1 12-ounce bag of semisweet chocolate chips
1/4 cup margarine
(extra margarine and sugar for pan preparation)
Method:
Prepare pan: Cover an 11-by-16-inch jelly roll pan with aluminum foil. Grease with margarine and sprinkle with a little sugar. Beat egg whites until stiff. Using same (unwashed) beaters, beat egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Add ground walnuts and flour (or matzo meal) and mix to combine. Fold in beaten egg whites with a spoon. Spread in prepared pan and cook at 300 degrees for about 25-30 minutes, until golden and cake springs back at a light touch. Remove from oven. Starting at the short end, roll up both cake and foil to the end of the pan. Let cool, then carefully unroll and spread apricot preserves over the cake. Roll up again, this time without the foil, gently rolling the cake up and off the foil to the end of the pan. Frost with your favorite chocolate icing. (Cohen melts chocolate chips with margarine and a couple tablespoons of water over a gentle heat on the stove; she also sometimes does this in the microwave).
Note: Feel free to experiment with what you put both inside and outside the cake. Use any flavor jam you like. We also like cherry and raspberry preserves. Chocolate buttercream is also delicious both inside and out, as is whipped cream flavored with sugar and vanilla.Lighthouse Carrots
(This recipe, which is great with chicken, is adapted from a favorite side dish from a restaurant the Cohens love.)
Ingredients:
1 pound carrots
1 pound parsnips
1 banana (optional)
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon honey
6 tablespoons orange juice
(This recipe is easily doubled for company. It should have the consistency of mashed pototoes. For a thicker consistency, use less orange juice.)
Method:
Wash and peel carrots and parsnips, and cut into 1-inch-long chunks. Boil in water until soft, then drain. Puree both carrots and parsnips in food processor, adding cinnamon, honey, and orange juice. Add the banana if you want (it will add sweetness and creaminess). Adjust seasonings according to taste. Put the mixture into a Pyrex dish and put in the microwave or oven until thoroughly warm.Chremslach (Dried Fruit Pancakes)
(This dish can be served for Passover, or for brunch or as a sweet, side dish.)
Ingredients:
3 eggs, beaten
1/2 cup cut-up dried fruit (either apricots, prunes, raisins, etc.. - or, a mix is nice)
3 tablespoons walnuts, coarsely chopped (optional)
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons sweet wine or fruit juice
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/3 cup flour (or matzo meal)
Light olive oil or canola oil for frying
(This recipe is easily doubled or tripled).
Method:
Combine all ingredients except oil. Let stand for 10 minutes. Drop from a tablespoon into hot oil (just enough oil to coat the skillet) and fry on both sides until golden brown. Remove from the skillet and serve hot with toppings like cinnamon-sugar, or apricot or peach jam that has been thinned with water and heated to make a syrup (use just enough water so it has the consistency of syrup and just warm the mixture - do not bring it to a boil).

Sorry, Tom and Pat, I couldn't eat the lobster

Abstract: I have always maintained that they are. I personally see no significant difference between a lobster and, say, a giant Madagascar hissing cockroach, which is a type of cockroach that grows to approximately the size of William Howard Taft (1857-1930). If a group of diners were sitting in a nice restaurant, and the waiter were to bring them each a freshly killed, steaming-hot Madagascar hissing cockroach, they would not put on silly bibs and eat it with butter. No, they would run, retching, directly from the restaurant to the All-Nite Drive-Thru Lawsuit Center. And yet these very same people will pay $24.95 apiece to eat a lobster, despite the fact that it displays all three of the classic biological characteristics of an insect, namely: I do not eat lobsters, although I once had a close call. I was visiting my good friends Tom and Pat Schroth, who live in Maine (state motto: "Cold, But Damp"). Being generous and hospitable people, Tom and Pat went out and purchased, as a special treat for me, the largest lobster in the history of the Atlantic Ocean, a lobster that probably had been responsible for sinking many commercial vessels before it was finally apprehended by nuclear submarines. This lobster was big enough to feed a coastal Maine village for a year, and there it was, sprawling all over my plate, with scary insectoid legs and eyeballs shooting out in all directions, while Tom and Pat, my gracious hosts, smiled happily at me, waiting for me to put this thing in my mouth.

Full text: People eat some really strange food, but I draw the line at things that look like insects.
I am pleased to report that the scientific community has finally stopped wasting time on the origins of the universe and started dealing with the important question, which is: Are lobsters really just big insects?
I have always maintained that they are. I personally see no significant difference between a lobster and, say, a giant Madagascar hissing cockroach, which is a type of cockroach that grows to approximately the size of William Howard Taft (1857-1930). If a group of diners were sitting in a nice restaurant, and the waiter were to bring them each a freshly killed, steaming-hot Madagascar hissing cockroach, they would not put on silly bibs and eat it with butter. No, they would run, retching, directly from the restaurant to the All-Nite Drive-Thru Lawsuit Center. And yet these very same people will pay $24.95 apiece to eat a lobster, despite the fact that it displays all three of the classic biological characteristics of an insect, namely:
1. It has way more legs than necessary.
2. There is no way you would ever pet it.
3. It does not respond to simple commands such as, "Here, boy!"
I do not eat lobsters, although I once had a close call. I was visiting my good friends Tom and Pat Schroth, who live in Maine (state motto: "Cold, But Damp"). Being generous and hospitable people, Tom and Pat went out and purchased, as a special treat for me, the largest lobster in the history of the Atlantic Ocean, a lobster that probably had been responsible for sinking many commercial vessels before it was finally apprehended by nuclear submarines. This lobster was big enough to feed a coastal Maine village for a year, and there it was, sprawling all over my plate, with scary insectoid legs and eyeballs shooting out in all directions, while Tom and Pat, my gracious hosts, smiled happily at me, waiting for me to put this thing in my mouth.
Remember when you were a child, and your mom wouldn't let you leave the dinner table until you ate all your Brussels sprouts, and so you took your fork and mashed them into smaller and smaller pieces in hopes of eventually reducing them to individual Brussels-sprout molecules that would be absorbed into the atmosphere and disappear? That was similar to the approach I took with the giant lobster.
"Mmmm-MMMM!" I said, hacking away at the thing on my plate and, when nobody was looking, concealing the pieces under my dinner roll, in the salad, in my napkin, anywhere I could find.
Tom and Pat, I love you dearly, and if you should ever have an electrical problem that turns out to be caused by a seven-pound wad of old lobster pieces stuffed into the dining-room wall socket, I am truly sorry.
Anyway, my point is that lobsters have long been suspected, by me at least, of being closet insects, which is why I was very pleased recently when my alert journalism colleague Steve Doig referred me to an Associated Press article concerning a discovery by scientists at the University of Wisconsin.
The article, headlined "Gene Links Spiders and Flies to Lobsters," states that not only do lobsters, flies, spiders, millipedes, etc., contain the exact same gene, but they also are all descended from a single common ancestor: Howard Stern.
No, seriously, the article states that the ancestor "probably was a wormlike creature." Yum! Fetch the melted butter!
And that is not all. According to articles sent in by alert readers (this was on the front page of The New York Times), scientists in Denmark recently discovered that some lobsters have a weird little pervert organism living on their lips. Yes. I didn't even know that lobsters had lips, but it turns out that they do, and these lips are the stomping ground of a tiny creature called Symbion pandora (literally, "a couple of Greek words"). The zoology community, which does not get out a lot, is extremely excited about Symbion pandora, because it reproduces differently from all other life forms.
According to various articles, when Symbion pandora is ready to have a baby, its digestive system "collapses and is reconstituted into a larva," which the parent then gives birth to by "extruding" it from its "posterior." In other words - correct me if I am wrong here - this thing basically reproduces by pooping.
So to summarize: If you're looking for a hearty entree that 1) is related to spiders, 2) is descended from a worm and 3) has mutant baby-poopers walking around on its lips, then you definitely want a lobster. I myself plan to continue avoiding them, just as I avoid oysters, which are clearly - scientists should look into this next - members of the phlegm family. Have you ever seen oysters reproduce? Neither have I, but I would not be surprised to learn that the process involves giant undersea nostrils.
And don't get me started on clams. Recently, I sat across from a person who was deliberately eating clams. She'd open up a shell, and there, in plain view, would be this stark naked clam, brazenly showing its organs, like a high-school biology experiment. My feeling is that if a restaurant is going to serve those things, it should put little loincloths on them.
I believe that Mother Nature gave us eyes because she did not want us to eat this type of food. Mother Nature clearly intended for us to get our food from the "patty" group, which includes hamburgers, fish sticks and McNuggets - foods that have had all of their organs safely removed someplace far away, such as Nebraska. That is where I stand on this issue, and if any qualified member of the lobster, clam or phlegm-in-a-shell industry wishes to present a rebuttal, I hereby extend this offer: Get your own column.This classic Dave Barry column was originally published Jan. 26, 1996.

Sank or sunk, it's your choice

Publication info: Sun Journal ; Lewiston, Me. [Lewiston, Me]19 Feb 2006: D6.

Abstract: Before leaving the links, we ought to consider the past tense of "sink." Should the reporter have said that [Tiger Woods] "sank" too few putts - or "sunk" too few putts? In his "Modern American Usage," Bryan Garner addresses the choice. He quotes an item in The New York Times about a fellow who was drinking beer as he stood on a tabletop in Munich. A woman he had never met "came up behind him and sunk her teeth into his leg." Garner would have emended the sentence to read, "sank her teeth into his leg." In another example, Garner examines a story from Boston, where a basketball player "sunk 15 of 23 shots." Garner would have edited to read, "sank 15 of 23 shots."

Full text: When Tiger Woods lost the Western Open by two strokes last summer, a reporter asked for a comment. "I'm really disappointed," said the Tiger, "but I'm proud of the way I hung in there and grinded it out."
Grinded it out? We're talking about verbs today, and "grinded" is a beauty. Only the giant Oxford English Dictionary acknowledges its existence, but surely "grinded" is much grindier than the pedestrian "ground." You can feel the grit. There's precedent in "to mind," as in "Lady Macbeth minded her manners." She didn't mound them. Otherwise the usual authorities give us bind/bound, find/found, and for a clock, wind/wound.
Before leaving the links, we ought to consider the past tense of "sink." Should the reporter have said that Woods "sank" too few putts - or "sunk" too few putts? In his "Modern American Usage," Bryan Garner addresses the choice. He quotes an item in The New York Times about a fellow who was drinking beer as he stood on a tabletop in Munich. A woman he had never met "came up behind him and sunk her teeth into his leg." Garner would have emended the sentence to read, "sank her teeth into his leg." In another example, Garner examines a story from Boston, where a basketball player "sunk 15 of 23 shots." Garner would have edited to read, "sank 15 of 23 shots."
Garner's opinions always deserve respect, but there's no binding rule on the matter of sank/sunk. The choice is finally a matter of a writer's ear. Offhand, I would suppose that the Tiger's putts sank and the Boston center's 15 shots sank, but the woman in Munich properly sunk her teeth into the leg of the unoffending fellow. Or improperly. Consider the Titanic: It either sank or sunk. Your call. Consider the drama critic as he ponders a bad performance. It stank? Or it stunk? Which is stinkier? What about the past tense of "to shrink"? The cheap shirt either shrank or it shrunk, but "shrank" appears to be the wider choice. Have we lately huddled over slink/slinked/slunk? A writer could wait months - indeed, years - for a chance to write that "the skunk slunk."
Such difficult choices abound. What is your feeling about "wiggle" and "wriggle"? In USA Today, a Seattle pitcher "wiggled out of a jam." In Chicago, a columnist complained that "sex offenders have been wriggling through legal loopholes." The last time I asked for a vote, a consensus began to form that earthworms wriggle and some defendants wiggle, but the sample was not large enough to be conclusive.
Have we recently examined a homely verb for "to expectorate"? Probably not. Is the preferred past tense "spit" or "spat"? The choice turns upon context. Little Bobby just spit out his spinach; our villain spat his warning. Thinking of "spat," it's not only a verb, it's also a noun. A spat is a young oyster, a covering for a shoe and a petty quarrel. Stop digressing!
As every writer knows, words have penumbras, echoes, associations. The past tense of "to shine" is either "shined" or "shone," but one active verb works for the sun and the other for a pair of shoes. A supplicant either "kneeled" or "knelt." It was his prayer, but it's your verb.James Kilpatrick is a syndicated columnist.

Abstract: Back In Black was formed in 2001, by former LA band-mates Mike Mroz and Darren Caperna. Mroz recognized the potential of the band when he realized Caperna's uncanny ability to transcend the spirit of both Scott and [Brian Johnson] into his voice. Drummer Jay Benzi, guitarist Mike Wagner and bass player Taylor Smith lend their impressive musicianship and vocals to the band. The band has created quite a buzz within the rapidly expanding tribute-band industry.

Many problems with oily skin inflammation

Abstract: DEAR DR. [DONOHUE]: Which foods are the best sources of vitamin B-12? My mom had pernicious anemia and had to take B-12 injections for it. I don't want to get it too. - B.B. Most of the world eats a vegetarian diet, and those who do are the healthier for it. Through the centuries, these people have learned how to include B-12 in their diets. Vegetarians coming from cultures not used to vegetarianism can develop a B-12 deficiency if they don't pay close attention to alternate sources of the vitamin. Some will have to take a B-12 supplement. Your mother's pernicious anemia most likely didn't come from too little B-12 in her diet. It probably came from a lack of intrinsic factor, a stomach substance that facilitates B-12 transport into the circulation. Relatives of a patient with a lack of intrinsic factor have an increased risk of coming down with it.

Full text: DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Please say something about seborrheic dermatitis. I have had it for many years, but nothing I've tried has worked. What's the cause, and what do you suggest for treatment? - T.R.
ANSWER: The literal translation of "seborrhea" is "flowing oil." Dermatitis is skin inflammation. Seborrheic dermatitis is inflammation of skin that has more than its share of oil glands - specifically, the scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, the creases that run from the sides of the nose to the lips, the ear canal, the skin behind the ear, the cleft between the buttocks and the groin. On the scalp, seborrheic dermatitis is a form of dandruff.
Along with an overproduction of oil, a skin yeast with the name Pityrosporum is believed to play a role in the inflammation.
The skin turns red, has scales on its surface and is greasy. It often itches. The scales fall off, particularly when a person scratches.
Antifungal agents are incorporated into a treatment program to eliminate the skin yeast. Ketoconazole (Nizoral) and ciclopirox (Loprox) are available in foams, liquids, creams and ointments. The choice between preparations depends on the location of the problem. Both of these medicines require a prescription.
Before launching antifungal therapy, calm the skin inflammation with a cortisone cream, many of which are available on drugstore shelves. It quickly resolves the inflammation and the itching, which can drive people crazy.
If you had specified where your seborrhea is, I could have added some other information. For instance, ear-canal seborrhea, whose itching is exasperating, is treated with eardrops.
The smartest course for you to take for long-standing seborrheic dermatitis is to forget about self-therapy and consult a dermatologist.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: Which foods are the best sources of vitamin B-12? My mom had pernicious anemia and had to take B-12 injections for it. I don't want to get it too. - B.B.
ANSWER: Vitamin B-12 is not found in any plants, so fruits, vegetables and grains have none. Meat, poultry, eggs and shellfish are loaded with it. Many foods are vitamin-B12-fortified; cereals are a good example. Even though cereal grains have none, fortification makes them a good source. You have to check the nutrition label to see if B-12 has been added.
Most of the world eats a vegetarian diet, and those who do are the healthier for it. Through the centuries, these people have learned how to include B-12 in their diets. Vegetarians coming from cultures not used to vegetarianism can develop a B-12 deficiency if they don't pay close attention to alternate sources of the vitamin. Some will have to take a B-12 supplement.
Your mother's pernicious anemia most likely didn't come from too little B-12 in her diet. It probably came from a lack of intrinsic factor, a stomach substance that facilitates B-12 transport into the circulation. Relatives of a patient with a lack of intrinsic factor have an increased risk of coming down with it.
DEAR DR. DONOHUE: What do you think of doctors over 70 operating? A friend needs a cataract operation. She and her husband have gone to an eye doctor for years and like him very much. He is over 70. She hasn't heard anything adverse against him, but she has some fears that age might have made him less competent in the operating room. What can she do to quiet her fears? - Anon.
ANSWER: It's not a matter of age. It's a matter of what age has done to a doctor. If the doctor has steady hands, a clear brain and is physically fit, I wouldn't hesitate to have that doctor operate on my eyes. Something can be said for experience.
Hospitals keep a close watch on their doctors, including eye doctors. If one isn't capable of performing up to par, that person is notified that privileges to practice in the hospital are being terminated.
This is the age of malpractice, and hospitals don't want suits any more than doctors want them.
Dr. Donohue regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but he will incorporate them in his column whenever possible. Readers may write him or request an order form of available health newsletters at P.O. Box 536475, Orlando, FL 32853-6475. Readers may also order health newsletters from www.rbmamall.com.

Abstract: Michael Garibay, 34, of Orlando, walked up to [Ed Johnson]'s car at a gas station Friday and asked the Orange County deputy if he was "straight," arrest records say. When Johnson said that he was, Garibay asked, "Do you know what that means? ... It means do you want to buy some cocaine." Johnson said "yes," and Garibay pulled out a plastic bag containing several pieces of flat white rock substances and asked for cash, records show. The deputy took the bag and arrested Garibay after the contents tested positive for cocaine, according to the records.Report: Car rally squawks at keas Denis Callesen, manager of the nearby Hermitage Hotel, said bird lovers need not be concerned the karate experts would use martial arts moves on the parrots, which are a protected species.

Full text: PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A 22-year-old man ate 173 chicken wings in 30 minutes, setting a record at the annual Wing Bowl.
Joey Chestnut, of San Jose, Calif., bested a field of 27 eaters Friday to take the title and top prize, a 2006 Suzuki Grand Vitara.
The 14th annual Wing Bowl was open only to competitors who had never before participated in the event. That meant 100-pound Sonya Thomas, who set the previous record of 167 wings in 2004, was excluded. Thomas, who is known as the "Black Widow" on the competitive circuit, won the World Grilled Cheese Eating Championship earlier this week.
Chestnut, a project engineer for a construction company, took second place. He qualified for the Wing Bowl by downing a gallon of milk in 41 seconds.Forget candy, send lobster instead
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) - An Australian company is making seafood sexy by selling gift-wrapped lobsters as a Valentine's Day present for kitchen-challenged romantics.
The "Romance Pack," a ribbon-wrapped gift box that can be mailed to customers, includes a three-course meal of two ready-cooked lobsters, six oysters and two heart-shaped chocolates for dessert, all packed in ice.
"All the man needs to do is supply a card and a bottle of champagne, and there's the gift," said Amanda Way, director of Clearwater Fisheries in the southern state of Tasmania. Way said the package, which costs $75 plus postage, was designed to bring couples together over a romantic dinner.Drug suspect lays rock with police
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Deputy Ed Johnson was in uniform. He was also sitting in a marked patrol car. So he was surprised when a man approached him and allegedly offered to sell him some cocaine.
Michael Garibay, 34, of Orlando, walked up to Johnson's car at a gas station Friday and asked the Orange County deputy if he was "straight," arrest records say. When Johnson said that he was, Garibay asked, "Do you know what that means? ... It means do you want to buy some cocaine."
Johnson said "yes," and Garibay pulled out a plastic bag containing several pieces of flat white rock substances and asked for cash, records show. The deputy took the bag and arrested Garibay after the contents tested positive for cocaine, according to the records.Report: Car rally squawks at keas
WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - Organizers of a vintage car rally reportedly have hired karate experts to protect the vehicles from marauding native parrots.
About 40 members of a local karate club have been enlisted to protect the 140 classic cars due to visit an alpine village near Mt. Cook on New Zealand's South Island today, the New Zealand Press Association reported Friday.
The karate experts will protect the cars from keas, native parrots that have been known to be destructive in their search for shiny items, the news agency said.
Denis Callesen, manager of the nearby Hermitage Hotel, said bird lovers need not be concerned the karate experts would use martial arts moves on the parrots, which are a protected species. Their job would simply be to scare the birds away, he said.
Local wildlife ranger Ray Bellringer said the karate experts were unlikely to deter the keas. "They will fly around and laugh," he said.
The best method to prevent keas from damaging vehicles was to squirt them with water pistols, he said.
