Abstract: A Bangor Daily News story (Oct. 25-26) described how the number of scallops on Georges Bank has jumped since fishing closures were put in effect several years ago. This may bring visions of future bounty to many a scalloper, but unless there is to be another boom-bust pounding of the resource, why not take out some "scallop insurance?" Here's how: A few years ago, Nova Scotia fisherman Kirk Munro suggested to scientists that the U.S.-Canada offshore border would be a perfect place for a scallop reserve. The idea: Keep this $100 million a year industry on as steady a keel as possible by protecting a permanent large community of fully grown spawners. The challenge: Two nations manage the Georges Bank scallop fishery. In the mid-1980s the United States and Canada divvied up control of Georges Bank. It took quite a battle -- from confrontations offshore all the way to the International Court of Justice at The Hague in Holland. There, this world court divided ownership of this sprawling sunken territory (as big as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut combined). Since then, the U.S.-Canada offshore border through this submerged plateau, with its underwater canyons, great plains of mud, and current-swept watery Saharas of san and gravel has been called the "Hague Line."

Full text: A Bangor Daily News story (Oct. 25-26) described how the number of scallops on Georges Bank has jumped since fishing closures were put in effect several years ago. This may bring visions of future bounty to many a scalloper, but unless there is to be another boom-bust pounding of the resource, why not take out some "scallop insurance?" Here's how:
Researchers know that scallops live up to 20 years in the wild, and that is not until they have reached their 12th year that fertility is at a maximum. These "dinner plate" size scallops can produce 150 million eggs per year, compared to a mere 10 million eggs in a 4-year-old harvestable juvenile.
But under the past and, likely, future fishing regulations, by their fifth year virtually all Georges Bank scallops are captured (or killed and left on the bottom by heavy offshore scallop dredges).
A few years ago, Nova Scotia fisherman Kirk Munro suggested to scientists that the U.S.-Canada offshore border would be a perfect place for a scallop reserve. The idea: Keep this $100 million a year industry on as steady a keel as possible by protecting a permanent large community of fully grown spawners. The challenge: Two nations manage the Georges Bank scallop fishery.
In the mid-1980s the United States and Canada divvied up control of Georges Bank. It took quite a battle -- from confrontations offshore all the way to the International Court of Justice at The Hague in Holland. There, this world court divided ownership of this sprawling sunken territory (as big as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut combined). Since then, the U.S.-Canada offshore border through this submerged plateau, with its underwater canyons, great plains of mud, and current-swept watery Saharas of san and gravel has been called the "Hague Line."
U.S. and Canadian scientists have been busy studying the ecology of scallops out on Georges Bank's Northern Edge and Northeast Peak, where turbulent water and plenty of food make things ideal for this popular bivalve. This is also where the Hague Line crosses Georges Bank.
One thing learned is that scallop larvae hatched on Georges Bank, stay there. Twice a day, the tide pushes water (and scallop eggs and larvae in season) back and forth across the Bank around 40 miles. At the same time, the prevailing current there moves clockwise around the bank at around five miles daily.
According to biologist Martin Willison of Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, and American researcher Richard McGarvey, with those prevailing currents and tidal flows, a 10-kilometer-wide no-take reserve along the length of the Hague Line would "have a substantial effect on scallop recruitment throughout the bank," according to the Centre for Wildlife and Conservation Biology in Wolfeville, Nova Scotia. "A protected zone along the entire length of this line ... may suffice to enhance and stabilize the scallop fisheries in both the USA and Canada. For this protective zone to be effective, all commercial and destructive activities must be excluded, with the exception of shipping lanes."
In other words, more egg production, more larvae drifting to new homes across the Georges Bank plateau. More scallops.
In the BDN article, Maine Department of Marine Resources official Chris Finlayson said the spectacular increas of scallops on Georges Bank shows that closures could be an important scallop management tool lacking in the present scallop management plan.
The challenge is to designate permanent reserves offshore, where scallops can live their natural 20-year lifespan, as opposed to temporary closures, which will inevitably succumb to the boom-bust syndrome once re-opened.
A wild area on the Hague Line will also provide Gulf of Maine scientists something they desperately need -- a large undisturbed area of the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank where they can learn how wild marine nature actually works. At present, virtually every square inch of the gulf and Georges Bank is worked over with drags and dredges, up to twice a year. As a result, marine scientists have no natural areas to use to gain `baseline' information about how marine life behaves in its natural setting. Without such basic data, the results of even the most elaborately designed computer models are questionable. We can see where flawed modeling based on incomplete data has brought us.
Creating a marine reserve on the border will require cooperative efforts between citizens and diplomats of both nations. But it can be done. We have cross-border parks and wilderness areas on land. We must likewise set aside a part of our underwater public domain from exploitation, or we will be doomed to repeating over and over the disasters of the past.
Why not take out a little "scallop insurance"?

Abstract: U.S. Sens. Olympia Snowe and John Breaux of Louisiana have introduced the Harmful Algal Bloom Research and Control Act of 1997 authorizing increased funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and providing a "focused and appropriate" response to harmful algal blooms in the United States. Algal blooms, which are damaging outbreaks of frequently toxic algae, affect coastal states and territories and have been increasing during the past 30 years. Scientists have not been able to explain the phenomena and there is no alternative but to close affected areas to swimming and fishing, Snowe said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- U.S. Sens. Olympia Snowe and John Breaux of Louisiana have introduced the Harmful Algal Bloom Research and Control Act of 1997 authorizing increased funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and providing a "focused and appropriate" response to harmful algal blooms in the United States.
One form of algal bloom is Maine's red tide, which costs millions of dollars from closed clam flats.
Algal blooms, which are damaging outbreaks of frequently toxic algae, affect coastal states and territories and have been increasing during the past 30 years. Scientists have not been able to explain the phenomena and there is no alternative but to close affected areas to swimming and fishing, Snowe said.
A recent outbreak of Pfisteria in the Chesapeake Bay has resulted in media attention, but Pfisteria is just one example of the larger problem of algal blooms, Snowe said.
"In my state of Maine," Snowe said, "we have outbreaks of paralytic shellfish poisoning every year which require the closure of clam flats along the coast, and the loss of millions of dollars in potential income." She said other regions also suffered, including the Georges Bank, where blooms cause $3 million to $5 million in damage each year. In 1991 in Washington state, an outbreak caused losses of razor clams valued at more than $15 million. Off Alaska, as much as $50 million worth of shellfish are put off-limits each year because of the outbreaks.
The Snowe-Breaux legislation focuses federal support on NOAA research and provides a specific annual authorization of $10.5 million for fiscal 1998, 1999 and 2000, to fund the Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms project, part of NOAA's Coastal Oceans Project.
The legislation also would upgrade NOAA research lab capabilities, provide education and extension services through sea grant colleges and universities, augment federal and state monitoring for early detection, and provide grants to states under the Coastal Zone Management Act.

Scientist: 105-day shrimp season is too long

Author: Walter Griffin Of the NEWS Staff

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]11 Nov 1997: 1.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/413904883?accountid=10457

Abstract: "The scheme upon which the industry advisers came up with the 105-day season is based on the assumption that the catch per day will be directly related to the amount of shrimp out there," Department of Marine Resources biologist Dan Schick said Monday. "The problem is, our research indicates that the biomass of shrimp out there is in decline." The ASMFC is a panel of scientists and industry representatives appointed by the federal government to regulate fisheries in state and federal waters. Schick serves as an adviser to the panel. He had recommended a shrimp season from Feb. 1 to March 31, a total of 59 days. Last year's season was 156 days. Schick based his recommendation on physical surveys conducted on the northern shrimp population over the past two decades and the tonnage of shrimp landed this year. More than 7,000 tons of shrimp were harvested during the 1996-97 season.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Despite protests from the scientific community, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has imposed a northern shrimp season of 105 days, twice the number of days scientists recommended.
"The scheme upon which the industry advisers came up with the 105-day season is based on the assumption that the catch per day will be directly related to the amount of shrimp out there," Department of Marine Resources biologist Dan Schick said Monday. "The problem is, our research indicates that the biomass of shrimp out there is in decline."
The ASMFC is a panel of scientists and industry representatives appointed by the federal government to regulate fisheries in state and federal waters. Schick serves as an adviser to the panel. He had recommended a shrimp season from Feb. 1 to March 31, a total of 59 days. Last year's season was 156 days.
Schick based his recommendation on physical surveys conducted on the northern shrimp population over the past two decades and the tonnage of shrimp landed this year. More than 7,000 tons of shrimp were harvested during the 1996-97 season.
ASMFC members rejected Schick's recommendation during a meeting in Gloucester, Mass., last Friday.
Instead, commissioners decided that the season for harvesting shrimp in the Gulf of Maine will open Dec. 8 and close May 22. No shrimp fishing will be allowed on Saturdays and Sundays. In addition, shrimp fishing will be shut down from Christmas to New Year's Eve and from March 16 through March 31.
The season for catching shrimp in traps similar to those used to catch lobster will run from New Year's Day through Feb. 28.
Although the fisheries panel rejected his recommendation, Schick maintained that the accumulated scientific data paints a troubling picture of the shrimp stock. He said the ASMFC decision was based on the immediate economic needs of a troubled fishing industry instead of the long-term health of the shrimp stocks.
"There is just too much economic pressure, where people have overextended themselves," Schick said. "To a person, they are hoping shrimp will sustain them for another year. The shrimp resource in the Gulf of Maine is not that big. There are just too many people trying to make a living on the Gulf of Maine for the resource that is out there. It's not built to take that kind of pressure."
Schick said his research data point to a situation similar to that of the late 1970s, when the shrimp population experienced a dramatic decline and fishing was halted. He said the approximately 275 shrimp boats working the Gulf of Maine are captained by experienced, skilled shrimpers.
"The problem is that the reason these fishermen are still around is that they are the best at finding the concentrations of shrimp. These shrimp harvesters have the ability to find more shrimp. Last year they harvested 7,000 metric tons in 156 days. I think they could take 7-8,000 tons in 105 days this year," Schick said. "The ability for industry to hurt itself to the point where we might have to close it down is astounding. It seems very short-sighted to go for a maximum shrimp catch this year."
Schick noted that it only took a few years of overfishing to decimate ground fish stocks and the same could happen with shrimp. Like shrimp, ground fish regulations were established by a federal council weighted by members more concerned about economic than environmental issues. Schick said there is always a danger of overfishing when industry is given a strong hand at making policy.
"This whole business was touted as a wonderful example of co-management and industry getting together, but I question whether it's working," he said. "I really have to question whether it's in the best interest of industry to let the fox guard the hen house one more time."

Few petitioners collect signatures at Maine polls

Abstract: Although nine petitions were approved for circulation by the Secretary of State's office, only three were seen at polling places in northern and eastern Maine. Signatures were collected at scattered polling places to force a vote on the repeal of a tax credit for Bath Iron Works, on whether to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana for medicinal use, and to limit pesticide spraying. Petitions seeking to legalize marijuana and to limit campaign contributions were circulated in Ellsworth. If the petitions get at least 51,131 signatures, they will appear on next year's ballot. Bangor City Clerk Gail Campbell said she was concerned when she read that so many petitions could be circulating at polling places. She was, therefore, surprised to find people collecting signatures at only two of Bangor's nine polling places. Volunteers gathered signatures on the BIW tax credit repeal for part of the day at the Civic Center. The medical marijuana and pesticides petitions were circulated at Fifth Street School.

Full text: Far fewer people showed up at the polls to collect signatures on petitions Tuesday than had been expected.
Although nine petitions were approved for circulation by the Secretary of State's office, only three were seen at polling places in northern and eastern Maine. Signatures were collected at scattered polling places to force a vote on the repeal of a tax credit for Bath Iron Works, on whether to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana for medicinal use, and to limit pesticide spraying. Petitions seeking to legalize marijuana and to limit campaign contributions were circulated in Ellsworth. If the petitions get at least 51,131 signatures, they will appear on next year's ballot.
Signatures were also sought for petitions on local issues in some areas.
Bangor City Clerk Gail Campbell said she was concerned when she read that so many petitions could be circulating at polling places. She was, therefore, surprised to find people collecting signatures at only two of Bangor's nine polling places. Volunteers gathered signatures on the BIW tax credit repeal for part of the day at the Civic Center. The medical marijuana and pesticides petitions were circulated at Fifth Street School.
A volunteer who collected signatures on the medical marijuana petition and asked not to be identified for fear of upsetting his employer said about a third of voters he asked agreed to sign the petition. He said only a handful were hostile to the idea.
The volunteer said he was the only one collecting signatures in Bangor but that there were more volunteers in the surrounding area. Election wardens said some groups likely had trouble finding volunteers to collect signatures and were forced to curtail their efforts.
Petitions to raise the minimum age to buy cigarettes to 21, to allow video slot machines at parimutuel betting establishments, to ban federal fuel mandates, to change shellfish licensing and to enact stricter state and congressional term limits were also approved by the secretary of state.
In Ellsworth, a father-and-son team, members of the Green Party, collected signatures on a half-dozen petitions. Most popular was a proposal to criminalize pesticide spraying from the air, which had attracted more than 100 signatures by midafternoon, and a proposal to end tax benefits or other subsidies for Bath Iron Works. A local petition asked Blue Hill Memorial Hospital to stop incinerating waste.
A proposal for a referendum to legalize marijuana gathered 21 signatures, by 2:30 p.m. but 31 voters supported a referendum to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes.
In Dover-Foxcroft, the only petition being circulated was the Bath Iron Works petition, and people were stopping to sign it, according to Dover-Foxcroft Town Clerk Barbara Moore.
Sangerville residents were more interested in signing a petition for the reconstruction of Route 23 in Sangerville than they were on voting on the issue of widening the turnpike, said Town Clerk Alice Moulton.
The Route 23 reconstruction request was the only petition available for the voters' consideration in this Piscataquis County town.
In Fort Kent, signatures were collected on petitions to limit campaign contributions and to restrict herbicide and pesticide spraying. The BIW, pesticides and medical marijuana petitions were circulated in Lincoln. Voters were asked to sign the medical marijuana petition in Millinocket.

Cross the bridge to Beals Island, where small, family owned fishing wharves flank the rocky shore. Hike through the moss-carpeted fir and spruce forests broken by granite ledges on Great Wass Island. Then, cap the day with dinner at the Seafarer's Wife back in Jonesport. A hand-painted sign of a woman clad in a yellow apron, gazing through a telescope out to sea, points the way to the restaurant that has drawn people from every state and countries as far-flung as New Zealand. Born and raised in Jonesport, Faye Carver is the force behind the Seafarer's Wife. She comes from a long line of fine Down East cooks. Both her mother and grandmother once ran restaurants in town. Four years ago, carrying on her family's tradition, she opened a restaurant with an accent on fine dining.

Full text: Go for a Sunday drive down to Jonesport. Take in the sparkling waters of the Moosabec Reach. Cross the bridge to Beals Island, where small, family owned fishing wharves flank the rocky shore. Hike through the moss-carpeted fir and spruce forests broken by granite ledges on Great Wass Island.
Then, cap the day with dinner at the Seafarer's Wife back in Jonesport. A hand-painted sign of a woman clad in a yellow apron, gazing through a telescope out to sea, points the way to the restaurant that has drawn people from every state and countries as far-flung as New Zealand.
Born and raised in Jonesport, Faye Carver is the force behind the Seafarer's Wife. She comes from a long line of fine Down East cooks. Both her mother and grandmother once ran restaurants in town. Four years ago, carrying on her family's tradition, she opened a restaurant with an accent on fine dining.
Classical music wafts through the air. Candles are lit. Tables are set with white, hand-crocheted placemats. Napkins are tied with satin ribbons. A vase of tiny red carnations and baby's breath graces each table. Old china creamers and sugar bowls are set out.
Wearing a long, white apron and bonnet, Tanya Carver Shaw greets and attends to diners while her mother, behind the scenes, busily prepares the various dishes offered last Sunday evening. As appetizers, she serves melt-in-your-mouth crab canapes, steamed mussels and butter, cheese and crackers, and clusters of grapes and other fresh fruit. A choice of French onion soup or crabmeat stew and a light garden salad follow.
It's not hard to choose a main course. The Seafarer's Wife obtained fresh sea scallops on the opening of Maine's scallop season the previous day. Tender and savory, the shellfish have been baked in a creamy sauce.
A combination of haddock, shrimp, scallops and lobster sauteed in butter, scampi or cream sauces -- called Fisherman's Bounty -- and citrus pork roast were among the other dishes offered. The main course was accompanied by squash puree and an unforgettable blueberry sauce. Freshly baked dill bread comes with the meal.
For dessert, it was a tough choice between apple nut pudding; Seafarer's mud pie, a multilayered concoction of brownie crust, coffee ice cream, toasted almonds and whipped cream; and angel pie made of merengue and raspberries. The old-fashioned pudding was a perfect end to a rich meal.
Sound like a $100 dinner? In terms of quality food and service, it was. But the five-course meal actually cost just under $50 for two people, including tax and tip. Beverages were not included in the flat price. Alcohol is not served, but people can bring their own wine and beer.
Emerging from the kitchen wearing a starched white apron, the creator of the Seafarer's Wife chats with diners. She looks at home in her dining room decorated with a Home Comfort cook stove, ship's lantern, family pictures, crocheted quilts and other heirlooms.
In an interview the next day, Faye Carver tells how she was born in her paternal grandmother Clara Pliskowski's Cozy Corner Restaurant that once stood near the old Underwood sardine-packing plant in Jonesport.
Carver's mother, Virginia Dyer, was and still is an excellent cook who worked at a local inn before opening her own restaurant, Ginny's Food Shop, back in the 1940s. Her pea soup, baking powder biscuits and apple pie were much in demand.
"She made everything stretch. One of the local men used to say, `Man, look at that pea soup. You could add water and make it last a week,"' Carver recalls. "Mumma makes the most beautiful pie crust. Everytime I make something, I think of her."
Carver got an early start in the kitchen. By the age of 12, she was helping out in the kitchen at the inn where her mother worked. She was barely visible behind the kitchen counter.
"One of the salesmen who stayed there always said he was going to buy me a chef's hat so he could see my nose move back and forth," she says, chuckling.
Carver attended school in Jonesport and wound up marrying another Jonesporter, Judson Carver III. He served first in the Air Force and later the Coast Guard. They had one daughter and three sons. They lived all over the country before coming home to Maine nearly a quarter of a century ago.
Carver says she had always dreamed of having her own restaurant, but she didn't consider the idea seriously until her children were all grown up and out of the house four years ago. It took some prodding from her daughter, Tanya.
"I said, `Judd, please can I turn that living room into a dining room?" she remembers asking her husband. He told her, "Do it, go ahead, I don't care."
After cleaning and rearranging her turn-of-the-century home, Carver gathered her family around to brainstorm about how best to go about starting a restaurant. She didn't want to compete with local eateries, but felt there was a need for a restaurant specializing in fine Maine cuisine.
Housed in her front parlor, the Seafarer's Wife started out with only seven tables and four main courses: beef, chicken, haddock and lobster. She and her daughter and daughters-in-law waited on tables. Seating was and still is by reservation only.
Carver's mustard pickles, lobster stew, twice-baked potatoes, Fishermen's Bounty, mud pie puddings and other home-style food proved a hit with Mainers and seasonal visitors to the area. Before too long, to get a reservation took three weeks.
"What tickles my palate is what I think other people might want," she says.
Carver never envisioned she would have quite so much success. She soon found her tiny kitchen was far from adequate. It was so small she couldn't cook and wash dishes at the same time. Also, while she was cooking, her husband was sequestered upstairs.
"He was just like a little mole. We called it his O.J. Simpson quarters," she says.
After another family confab, the Carvers decided to build a larger Seafarer's Wife, with an adjoining eatery called the Ol' Salt, on Route 187 near Snare's Creek. They opened for business last June and are open seven days a week.
A dynamic woman who never stops, Carver doesn't mind that she has only one day off a week. Like her mother and grandmother, she takes pleasure in and prides herself on her cooking.
Last summer, she and her husband celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary.
"Guess where we ate? Guess where we went for dinner?" she asks, laughing.

Abstract: That's why she left part-time environmental activism and her organic farm in Jonesboro to work full time on her citizens initiative to limit pesticide spraying.

A populist movement around the turn of the century resulted in a constitutional amendment in 1909. By 3-to-1, Maine voters chose the right to bypass the Legislature when needed. Over the past 80 years or so, that has brought issues such as repealing the income tax, ending nuclear power, banning slot machines and repealing the moose hunting season up for a direct vote. There are 11 petition drives out there now, with at least three pending approval by the Secretary of State's Office. The issues range from capping the sales tax at 3 percent to term limits and repealing the tax credit for Bath Iron Works. The methods used are nearly as diverse as the causes. Some are grass-roots efforts, spreading by word of mouth and the Internet. Others are helped by national organizations which bring money and expertise.

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- The way Nancy Oden, one of Maine's growing number of political activists, sees it, the issue of whether to allow pesticide spraying is simple.
"Does anyone have the right to poison everyone's water? ... What's going on now is a giant experiment of how much poisoning we humans can take before we get sick and die. The answer is -- no more."
That's why she left part-time environmental activism and her organic farm in Jonesboro to work full time on her citizens initiative to limit pesticide spraying. She's now working in Augusta with a few volunteers, building a network of volunteers at colleges and in towns across the state, some of whom will hit the polls Tuesday with petitions. If they can get 51,131 signatures, which represents 10 percent of the voters in the last gubernatorial election, they can get the question on a future ballot.
Those volunteers will not be alone. There will be lots of people with a wide variety of petitions at the polls Election Day, part of the state's constantly growing experiment in direct democracy. It's a simple idea: Bypass the Legislature, and let the people decide.
But even though the ability to put questions on the ballot is a coveted form of democracy -- it's possible in only about a third of the states -- some people believe it is becoming too simple.
They say the complications of the public policy-making in the Legislature are a necessary part of good laws; that the rhetoric in the campaigns is oversimplified; and that too many groups are finding it too easy to initiate legislation.
"Since the early '90s the number {of petitions circulating} and the amount of activity has dramatically increased," said Rebecca Wyke, assistant secretary of state. "It used to be a rare event. Now everyone thinks they can do one."
A populist movement around the turn of the century resulted in a constitutional amendment in 1909. By 3-to-1, Maine voters chose the right to bypass the Legislature when needed. Over the past 80 years or so, that has brought issues such as repealing the income tax, ending nuclear power, banning slot machines and repealing the moose hunting season up for a direct vote.
Until the 1970s, there were only six citizen-initiated bills that ended up on the ballot. In the 1990s, there already have been nine.
There are 11 petition drives out there now, with at least three pending approval by the Secretary of State's Office. The issues range from capping the sales tax at 3 percent to term limits and repealing the tax credit for Bath Iron Works. The methods used are nearly as diverse as the causes. Some are grass-roots efforts, spreading by word of mouth and the Internet. Others are helped by national organizations which bring money and expertise.
Both frustration with the political system and a greater awareness of current events -- through technology such as the Internet -- have contributed to the phenomenal growth of citizen initiatives in Maine and across the United States, according to several experts. Last year there were 90 citizen iniatives on November ballots across the nation.
For someone trying to organize from the ground up, a rural state like Maine can be a huge obstacle. "I feel the burden of {51,131} signatures is excessive," said Oden.
But Wyke said it has become much simpler to collect the necessary signatures. "In 1909 I have to imagine it was a huge undertaking. Now the transportation infrastructure and communications are so much better -- the Internet makes it easier to get the message out -- computers, phones, fax, all make it a lot easier.
"I don't know that it's too easy," she said slowly, thinking it over. "I am discouraged that people use this as an alternative to the legislative process rather than a last resort. It was meant to be when the public rises up because the Legislature will not pass something that they want to pass -- a safety net. ... The legislative process provides a good deal of debate, public hearings, committee discussions, and legislators can amend the bill. ... Put it on a petition and it doesn't matter what kind of debate it engenders -- it passes and can't be changed."
Oden said she has tried for years to change the way pesticides are used in Maine without bypassing the legislative process, and it never worked. She told about reading the label of a pesticide to some bureaucrats: "It said, `Fatal if absorbed through the skin, swallowed or inhaled.' I said, `What does this mean to you?"' pointing to the word `fatal.'
"They just looked at me with blank eyes. There are no answers," she said.
Donald Christen started trying to influence the Legislature to legalize marijuana in 1989, he said, but got fed up with the slow pace.
"No one wants to talk about it, people are scared to do anything. Big Brother is watching," Christen said. He estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 people in Maine smoke pot. "If so many people are doing this, why are they persecuting us like they are?"
He has been arrested several times for marijuana trafficking, and is furious with the police and "the war on drugs which is a war on the citizenry of the United States." Volunteers will be at the polls Tuesday with two petitions Christen started: one to legalize marijuana and the other to legalize marijuana for medical purposes.
Carol Palesky, who has worked on several initiatives to try to lower taxes, says it's extremely important that residents have the right to petition government because "our elected officials, when they go to make laws in the Legislature, are under such political pressure from special interest groups giving donations that they take the meat out of legislation and leave loopholes to those who give the money."
Palesky believes that people who aren't elected aren't beholden to special interests with a lot of money.
She was convicted in August of aggravated forgery for tampering with petitions and is awaiting sentencing. Meanwhile, she is working on two new initiatives -- one to eliminate the snack tax and reduce the sales tax to 3 percent; the other to commit all lottery proceeds to fund education. As of Nov. 1, neither had been approved for circulation by the Secretary of State's Office.
John Brier Jr. has seen firsthand the influence of money, he said, and what big companies can do with their profits. While in Russia last summer he saw a "mobile disco," huge tents containing a dance club paid for by a giant tobacco company, that was moved from city to city by big trucks painted with cigarette advertising.
To get in, you had to show that you had bought five packs of their cigarettes -- no money allowed.
"That's clearly drug-dealer mentality," Brier said. "Move into the neighborhood, get 'em hooked, move on." Because he has seen marketing efforts like that by tobacco companies, and because he learned while researching his master's thesis in health care administration that only 1 percent of smokers began smoking after they were 20 years old, he believes the best way to prevent people from getting hooked on cigarettes is to require that people purchasing a pack be 21 or older.
He doesn't feel like he has time to wait for the Legislature to act: It's a public health crisis, he said, so he has to act fast. "It's so hard to get things done when you've got special intersts, lobbies. It's so hard to get things done. I am bypassing that bog-down. I'll bring it to the people."
But bringing it to the people isn't so easy if you're working full time, he said; he is coordinator of a program at the University of Maine at Augusta. He started the petition last year, but now "it's at a standstill. Initially I was able to set up a group, about 30 people around the state willing to help. But that's where I am now. I need to raise money. Fifty thousand dollars could get it done."
Last week a company from California -- Progressive Campaigns Inc. -- called him, he said, and told him it has organized petition campaigns in several states. Nationally, it's not unusual for companies to charge $1 to $3 per signature.
No one was answering the phone at Progressive Campaigns on Friday, and a message left on its answering machine was not returned that day.
As long as registered Maine voters are collecting the signatures and not earning money for each signature, it's perfectly legal to pay people for a citizens initiative effort. "That is the way things are headed, I guess," said Wyke. There have been national organizations donating money and time to Maine initiatives in the past, she said.
"Many times the people circulating these petitions are paid to circulate them, although in other circumstances it truly is all volunteer-based. It raises free speech issues and campaign funding issues," she said. "It's not always as grass-roots as people think."
William Coogan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Southern Maine, said that about half of the efforts are successful. But ironically, considering the intent of the right to petition, "the side that spends the largest amount of money is successful a very large percentage of the time, close to 90 percent of the time. This type of campaign is particularly susceptible to the influence of big money" on voters.
But for someone like Brier -- who saw his grandmother smoke four packs of cigarettes a day and die of emphysema, saw his uncle die of lung cancer, knows that his mother has been unable to quit smoking, and knows that 3,000 children in Maine start smoking every year -- $50,000 to get the issue on the ballot may well be worth it. "Just think what the state pays every year" on smoking-related illnesses, he said; it makes $50,000 look like small change.
While he knows firsthand how difficult it is to collect the signatures, he thinks the number required is fair. "If it were lower, probably too many issues would make it. It means that when things do come to a vote, a lot of people believe in it enough to sign. If you watered it down it would take away from the credibility of the process."
Christen, who is a full-time activist ("I could probably never get a job," because of his marijuana advocacy, he said), said if fewer signatures were required, it would be easier for people to participate in government. "This makes it very hard for the poor people to participate. If you have the money it doesn't take much to get the circulation, but if you don't have any money and the law is controversial and people who would like to change things are worried they might lose their job and this and that, it sure does make it hard. If 300,000 people in the state of Maine smoke pot, how is it we're having so much trouble collecting the signatures?"
As for Oden, she has been worrying about pesticides for 25 years or more. "I've tried science, logic and begging and pleading ... I finally said, it's getting late here. It's getting late in the poisoning of the earth. If people say, `I don't have time,' nothing will change. ...
"I'm trying to get back some control of the things that affect our health, our lives. It's just a little bit of democracy."

Abstract: ELLSWORTH -- Sea scallops have thrived on Georges Bank since those fishing grounds were closed to rebuild groundfish stocks several years ago. But the mollusks have not fared as well elsewhere in federal waters along the East Coast. To replenish scallop stocks, the New England and mid-Atlantic fishery management councils are proposing a mechanism enabling them to close fishing areas at critical times of the year, and other measures as part of proposed Amendment 7 to the federal Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan. Georges Bank -- a shallow shelf stretching from East of Cape Cod to the Canadian boundary line -- traditionally had been a prime fishing area for Maine scallop fishermen who hold federal licenses and fish beyond the 3-mile state limit. But that area was closed to fishing because of the collapse of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder several years ago.

Full text: ELLSWORTH -- Sea scallops have thrived on Georges Bank since those fishing grounds were closed to rebuild groundfish stocks several years ago. But the mollusks have not fared as well elsewhere in federal waters along the East Coast.
To replenish scallop stocks, the New England and mid-Atlantic fishery management councils are proposing a mechanism enabling them to close fishing areas at critical times of the year, and other measures as part of proposed Amendment 7 to the federal Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan.
The councils, which manage the scallop fishery in federal waters, unveiled Friday the proposed regulations in Ellsworth at the first of a series of public hearings. Other hearings are scheduled for Washington, D.C., New Jersey and Fairhaven, Mass.
Georges Bank -- a shallow shelf stretching from East of Cape Cod to the Canadian boundary line -- traditionally had been a prime fishing area for Maine scallop fishermen who hold federal licenses and fish beyond the 3-mile state limit. But that area was closed to fishing because of the collapse of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder several years ago.
"We are seeing a phenomenal growth of sea scallops in closed areas at Georges. In some places, they have increased sixfold. That's an impressive growth," John Williamson, a Maine representative on the New England Fishery Management Council and its scallop committee, told the half-dozen scallopers who turned out at the Ellsworth meeting.
Chris Finlayson, a Maine Department of Marine Resources official, said the dramatic growth of scallops on Georges Bank shows closures are an effective management tool lacking in the present scallop management plan.
Southwest Harbor fisherman Brett Mitchell countered that scallop stocks never were depleted on Georges Bank, and prohibiting scallop dragging has only worsened the situation. He used to fish that area.
"The fact those areas have been closed has put pressure in the mid-Atlantic area. Now that area has been pounded," he said.
In Maine, about 355 boats are licensed to fish for scallops in federal waters. But only a handful of scallop boats fish full time far beyond the 3-mile limit. Maine scallop draggers are also much smaller than their counterparts elsewhere along the eastern seaboard, ranging in length from 30-70 feet.
Several years ago, the Atlantic Sea Scallop Management Plan was adopted in an effort to cut harvesting in half. Initially, full-time scallopers were given a maximum of 240 days at sea per year. That figure dropped to 164 this year and is supposed to be reduced to 142 for the next two years.
However, because some scallop grounds since have taken such a pounding, federal fishery scientists are saying full-time scallopers should be limited to as little as 108 days next year.
As part of Amendment 7, the councils are proposing that those fishermen who want to get out of the scallop fishery be given a one-time chance to sell their active days at sea to other federal license holders for whom the industry is still a viable livelihood.
Southwest Harbor seafood dealer Cheryl Harper said such a move could put the fishery in the hands of large corporations that own multiple scallop boats.
"In my mind, only a few big people would be controlling the fishery," she said.
Southwest Harbor fisherman Wade Stroud said he thought scallopers should be given the option of buying days at sea but they should be limited to no more than 240 days per vessel.
"Some people don't want to be in the fishery. That's their way out," he said.

Passamaquoddy fishing trial to begin Tribe claims ancestral right

Abstract: The trial of 13 Passamaquoddy fishermen who face charges in Calais District Court for exercising what they claim is their ancestral right to fish in salt water without a state license is expected to begin Thursday morning. He said it is ridiculous to believe the tribe gave up its identity in 1980. "Passamaquoddy means `people who catch pollock,"' he said. "Someone is trying to force the ridiculous notion on us that somehow we agreed to stop being Passamaquoddy." Although the tribe and the state have been at the bargaining table trying to resolve the issue, marine patrol wardens began summoning tribal members late last year for various saltwater-fishing violations, including taking sea urchins out of season and dragging for scallops without a license.

Full text: CALAIS -- The trial of 13 Passamaquoddy fishermen who face charges in Calais District Court for exercising what they claim is their ancestral right to fish in salt water without a state license is expected to begin Thursday morning.
Assistant District Attorney Paul Cavanaugh said Tuesday the state will argue the 1980 Indian Land Claims Settlement Act settled the issue of jurisdiction and made tribal members subject to state law like everyone else.
Fred Moore, the tribe's legislative representative, said Tuesday the tribe did not give up its sovereign right to saltwater fishing when it signed the land claims settlement.
He said it is ridiculous to believe the tribe gave up its identity in 1980. "Passamaquoddy means `people who catch pollock,"' he said. "Someone is trying to force the ridiculous notion on us that somehow we agreed to stop being Passamaquoddy."
The federal land claims settlement extinguished Indian claims to 12.5 million acres that three of the state's four tribes claimed as their aboriginal hunting grounds. The three tribes -- the Passamaquoddy, Penobscot and Maliseet -- were granted self-governing authority similar to municipal home rule.
But nagging disputes about how the settlement act should be interpreted still exist. Saltwater fishing rights were never addressed specifically or resolved in negotiations, according to observers familiar with the agreement.
Although the tribe and the state have been at the bargaining table trying to resolve the issue, marine patrol wardens began summoning tribal members late last year for various saltwater-fishing violations, including taking sea urchins out of season and dragging for scallops without a license.
All of the defendants live on or near the Passamaquoddy reservation at Pleasant Point. They include::
Allie P. Beal, taking sea urchins out of season and two counts of violation of municipal shellfish laws.
Roger K. Brackett, Kenneth J. Newell Jr. and Joseph M. Sapiel, taking shellfish from contaminated flats.
Donell J. Dana Sr., fishing for scallops without a scallop boat license.
Carroll C. Francis and William J. Smith, 20 percent of clams undersize.
Carl J. Jillson Sr., 20 percent of clams undersize and fishing without a shellfish license.
Cecil R. Larkin, two counts of failure to stand by for a marine patrol officer and 20 percent of clams undersize.
Karli G. Murphy, fishing for elvers without a tag.
Francis L. Sapiel Jr., fishing for scallops without a scallop boat license, fishing for scallops without a noncommercial scallop license, and dragging for sea urchins without a license.
Clifton E. Smith Jr., 20 percent of clams undersize and two counts of taking shellfish without a license.
Ronald J. Trott Jr., taking shellfish without a license.
Before the trial begins, 4th District Court Judge John Romei will have to rule on a motion to dismiss the case filed by J. Hilary Billings, a tribal lawyer.
In the motion, Billings claims the state court does not have jurisdiction over the matter because "saltwater-fishing practices consistent with Passamaquoddy tribal heritage, culture and tradition are not subject to regulation by the state."
The attorney maintains that the Legislature and the Passamaquoddy Joint Tribal Council have responsibility over tribal saltwater-fishing rights and both sides are committed to a negotiated resolution.
In hopes that a negotiated resolution could be reached, tribal officials earlier this month spent two hours with Gov. Angus King. After that meeting, tribal leaders said the encounter had cracked open the door for future discussions on the issue, but at the same time they vowed that tribal fishermen would continue to fish Maine's coastal waters without licenses.
Tribal leaders also met with federal officials earlier this month to discuss their right to hunt federally protected porpoises. The Passamaquoddys consider the hunting of porpoises a sacred rite they have performed for generations. After that meeting, the two sides agreed to continue to meet and talk.

German wines require education for novices Learning how to read labels important first step

Abstract: Everything has a starting point. If you have ever had a glass of wine in your life, the first one may have been a German wine known as a Liebfraumilch. Go ahead, admit it. We've all had Liebfraumilch. There. Doesn't that feel better? Grape variety. This should be indicated, but is not always in lesser-quality wines. The major German varieties include Riesling, Muller Thurgau, Silvaner, Grauburgunder (or Pinot Gris), Weissburgunder (or Pinot Blanc), Scheurebe (a Riesling/Silvaner cross), Rieslaner (another Riesling/Silvaner cross), Gewurtztraminer and Spatburgunder (Pinot Noir), which is a red variety. Most exports to the United States are white. Quality and ripeness level. This is the complicated stuff. On the low end of quality are wines labeled Landwein and Tafelwein. (They usually taste like they sound.) The next level is Qualitatwein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (or QbA). These are wines of fairly decent quality. The next level is Qualitatwein mit Pradikat (or QmP). These QmP wines are listed in ascending order of dryness to sweetness. They are Kabinett, Spatlese, Auslese, Beerenauskese (BA), Eiswein (ice wine) and Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA).

Full text: Everything has a starting point. If you have ever had a glass of wine in your life, the first one may have been a German wine known as a Liebfraumilch. Go ahead, admit it. We've all had Liebfraumilch. There. Doesn't that feel better?
You know what I'm talking about, those long thin bottles with happy nuns in the vineyard or the long black cylindrical ones that look like shock absorbers. I can remember my parents serving the stuff at special occasions. They would really be splurging if the holy sisters of the vineyard were on the table.
If that was your first taste of German wine, it may have been your last -- until now.
If you put the words German and beverage in the same sentence, it usually conjures up a stereotypical image of a hefty dude wearing leiderhausen hoisting buckets of pilsner with a bratwurst-eating grin on his face. The solution to this nonsense? Educate yourself with some basics -- and taste the wines.
German wine labels
German wine labels can be somewhat confusing. While many changes in their labeling system have taken place, it still wouldn't hurt to get some basic facts about their viticulture. So here are some fundamentals. Don't worry about the pronunciation of many of these terms; you may hurt yourself.
The wine producer. This is the most critical factor for the quality of the product. Look for the term Erzeugerabfullung or Gustabfullung. This is equivalent to Estate Bottled.
Grape variety. This should be indicated, but is not always in lesser-quality wines. The major German varieties include Riesling, Muller Thurgau, Silvaner, Grauburgunder (or Pinot Gris), Weissburgunder (or Pinot Blanc), Scheurebe (a Riesling/Silvaner cross), Rieslaner (another Riesling/Silvaner cross), Gewurtztraminer and Spatburgunder (Pinot Noir), which is a red variety. Most exports to the United States are white.
Region of origin. These can be even more specific than the major producing regions, which include Mosel, Saar and Ruwer; Rheingau; Nahe; Baden; Rheinhessen; Rheinpfalz; Franken.
Vintage. The year of the grape harvest from which the wine was made.
Alcohol content. The beauty of many of these wines is their relatively low alcohol content and amazing balance.
Dryness. The term "Trocken" means dry. The term "Halbtrocken" means semi-dry.
Quality and ripeness level. This is the complicated stuff. On the low end of quality are wines labeled Landwein and Tafelwein. (They usually taste like they sound.) The next level is Qualitatwein bestimmter Anbaugebiete (or QbA). These are wines of fairly decent quality. The next level is Qualitatwein mit Pradikat (or QmP). These QmP wines are listed in ascending order of dryness to sweetness. They are Kabinett, Spatlese, Auslese, Beerenauskese (BA), Eiswein (ice wine) and Trockenbeerenauslese (TBA).
At the urging of one of its resident wine gurus and sales people, Doug Snell, a longtime friend of importer Rudi Wiest, local beverage distributor Pine State Trading has recently made a large commitment to German wines, having showcased about a dozen recently. If all you have ever had for German wine has been your parents' Liebfraumilch, now is the time to change course. Many of these wines are available now locally at wine stores and in restaurants by the glass.
1995 Iphofer Kalb Estate Silvaner $15
This wine has a nice mineral aroma, extremely crisp and dry. The same relative acidity that you would expect in a French Muscadet. Real clean and extremely dry with spicy nuances, beautifully long finish. It would go very well with shellfish. Interestingly bottled in a "Mateus"-styled bottle. (If you've gotten this far, you know what that is.)
1996 WH Heger Estate Pinot Gris $14
It has a very spicy aroma. Nice fruit, not unlike a Burgundian-styled Chardonnay. Wonderfully balanced with an apricot-like flavor that lingers in the aftertaste.
1995 Fritz Haag Estate Riesling $15
Nice light color with a cinnamon spice aroma. Nice and dry flavors with kind of a peachy flavor and once again a surprisingly long aftertaste. This wine could stand up very well to spicy Asian cooking.
1995 Rhineriver Selection, Cellars International $8
Nice light golden color with a honeyed aroma. It has a very pleasing fruity flavor with a nice medium crisp aftertaste. If you're not brave enough to bridge the Liebfraumilch gap on your own, try this wine. It has a vague similarity with one exception -- it's good.
1996 J.J Prum Estate Riesling $12
Kind of an earthy floral aroma with a light straw color. Full of tropical flavors like mangoes with a nice long finish -- very complex. Wow! I really like this wine.
1996 Saarburger Rausch Kabinett $16
Very delicate aroma. Nice smooth fruit flavors once again followed by crisp amazing acidity that you just don't even suspect.
1995 Urziger Wurzgarten Kabinett $15 --
Nice, subtly styled but not understated. It has a really nice honey flavor balanced by crisp acidity.
1995 Fritz Haag Brauneberberger Juffer-Sonnenuhr Spatlese $31 --
Explosive flavors, not your ordinary Spatlese. This is a real mouthful of wine. Full of flavor with the nice concentration of fruit that you would expect from a quality wine with a superbly long aftertaste. On a par with some of the highest-quality white wines I have ever tasted. I can't believe it's only 8 percent alcohol.
1995 Karthauserhof Spatlese $24 --
A nice elegant style of wine with layers of peach flavors. A good bit crisper in style than the Fritz Haag and not as complex, but overall an excellent wine.
1995 Ungsteiner Herrenberg Scheurebe Spatlese $19 --
This wine has a different, more herbal aroma and flavor that separates it stylistically from the rest. The flavor is pleasing and the sweetness is somewhat cloying, but it is balanced by a really nice aftertaste.
1995 Pfeffingen Ungsteiner Honigsackel Gewurztraminer Spatlese $19 --
Spicy, full and earthy aroma, golden-colored. Sweetly flavored but balanced. Full of rich spices and interesting layers. An excellent dessert wine.
As you try these wines, you will notice that they are magnificently balanced. With their crisp acidity, they have the tendency to be excellent food wines. The natural contrast for these wines is generally spicy foods such as Thai, Indian or even Mediterranean. Because of their elegance and balance, try to pair them off with foods that you would normally have with Chardonnay.

Dredging worries clammers Project would ease journey for destroyers at BIW

Abstract: A plan to dredge a portion of the Kennebec River to make way for destroyers at Bath Iron Works could mean trouble for clammers.

Full text: PHIPPSBURG -- A plan to dredge a portion of the Kennebec River to make way for destroyers at Bath Iron Works could mean trouble for clammers.
The mud diggers say they agree the dredging is warranted, but they don't think enough is being done to prevent the project from polluting and perhaps smothering some of the bivalves.
Members of the Army Corps of Engineers, which plans to move about 50,000 cubic yards of the riverbed next month, met with clammers Thursday to tell them about the project.
At two sections of the river, the 500-foot-long destroyers have trouble steering past underwater ridges of sand that have collected along the bottom since 1989, when the river was last dredged.
At the worst spot, Doubling Point, the bottom rises in some places to within 21 feet of the surface, eight feet above the bottom of the ships. In the narrow, fast-moving channel, the ships are forced to make a near 180-degree turn to get past the rising sand.
The corps' director of the project, William Kavanaugh, said he believes the impact on marine life in the area will be negligible. The material to be removed from the river bottom is about 95 percent sand, not the silt and other sediment that typically carries far along the currents, or breeds the bacteria that can force clam-flat closure.
Kavanaugh said the last dredging didn't disrupt clamming along the river.

Abstract: Sometimes Marjorie Marsh Quigg believes the Brady Gang came into her life for a reason. In a turn of events so odd it might be fiction, her daughter was born because two gangsters died. And even stranger, in the weeks before the shootout, she rubbed shoulders with the outlaws while working at her father's cafe. Tucked behind Main Street at 101 Pickering Square, near the site of the present Key Plaza, Forrest B. Marsh's Pine Tree Restaurant was a favorite Brady Gang haunt, Quigg said, because it was out of the way, around the corner." Then a new bride of 20, Quigg was a part-time cashier who helped prepare the daily menus whenever her father and mother - known as Queenie" or Mother Marsh" - needed her help.

Full text:   Sometimes Marjorie Marsh Quigg believes the Brady Gang came into her life for a reason. In a turn of events so odd it might be fiction, her daughter was born because two gangsters died. And even stranger, in the weeks before the shootout, she rubbed shoulders with the outlaws while working at her father's cafe.
Tucked behind Main Street at 101 Pickering Square, near the site of the present Key Plaza, Forrest B. Marsh's Pine Tree Restaurant was a favorite Brady Gang haunt, Quigg said, because it was out of the way, around the corner."
In common parlance, they had probably cased the joint before they ever came in to dine," the Bangor woman recalled.That was always at 5 minutes to 8 in the evening, just before closing time. I suppose they could eat at that hour without anyone seeing them."
Then a new bride of 20, Quigg was a part-time cashier who helped prepare the daily menus whenever her father and mother - known as Queenie" or Mother Marsh" - needed her help.
Greeting three men seated at a front window table one night, she sized them up as well-dressed, soft-spoken city slickers.
There was nothing about them that aroused my suspicions, but you just knew they were different, even before they said anything," she remembered. They were not refined, a little hard looking. But certainly not gangster types. All of the girls loved to wait on them because they tipped so well."
One evening, Quigg said, her father was unable to serve the trio an hors d'oeuvre they'd ordered. As they stood up to greet him, he said, Gentlemen, I hope you'll find everything satisfactory. But I don't have oysters on the half shell tonight. Come back in a few days and I'll have them for you."
They agreed, content to eat their steaks. For small men they had voracious appetites, Quigg remembered, no daily specials for them."
A week or so later she bumped into the threesome again a few blocks from the Pine Tree. Hurrying back to the restaurant one afternoon after buying a $3 suede belt at Rines Department Store at 43 Main St., she was startled when the driver of a black touring car parked at the curb honked his horn at her. She jumped, the three hoods in the front seat giggled, and that's when I saw the teeth of one of the men. He had beautiful teeth," she recalled.
The other half of her story has a different twist. On the morning of Oct. 12, following weeks of medical problems, Quigg was scheduled to consult with her surgeon at a local hospital for a possible hysterectomy. Her husband, Paul, and other family members were anguished over her decision, fearing a vibrant, young woman soon might be unable to bear children.
She unpacked her overnight bag after Paul burst into their home with startling news. There had been a shooting downtown and her surgeon, Dr. John Bud" Thompson, was detained at another hospital to help assist with a wounded FBI agent, Walter Walsh.
Quigg reassessed her need for surgery and, to her surprise and her family's delight, she soon became pregnant. On July 7, 1938, her daughter, Nancy Jane, was born. Her only child, Nancy Smith, now 59, is a teacher in East Taunton, Mass., with two sons of her own.
On Oct. 13, Forrest, Queenie and Marjorie were horrified to see mug shots in the morning papers revealing the three young men from the Pine Tree Restaurant as America's most-wanted criminals.
The shootout was shocking in a way," Quigg recalled. My parents and I just thought, "Well, there's some reason why this happened to our family."

Full text: SORRENTO -- Great Eastern Mussel Farms has received a 10-year exclusive lease to grow blue mussels in a 14.3-acre patch of Flanders Bay, off the eastern shore of Sorrento, despite protests from a few residents.
The Department of Marine Resources authorized the permit, one of about half a dozen active mussel leases statewide, last month. Great Eastern, based in Tenants Harbor, expects the site to yield up to 7,000 bushels of the mollusks per year.
"That area is very good for mussels," said Great Eastern's president, Chip Davison. "And it's not a good lobster area."
Great Eastern has been growing mussels since 1979. The company harvests, processes and markets about 150,000 bushels of mussels a year. Davison said Great Eastern also has leases in Stonington and Trenton, and has harvested wild mussels in Flanders Bay for years.
"What's new about this is that we seed the beds instead of waiting for nature to do it."
Davison said juvenile mussels can reach adult size in a year if they are transplanted from wild beds and spread thinly. In the wild, they are often so densely packed that it takes 12 years for them to grow to full size.
More than a third of Maine's mussel harvest is now cultivated instead of simply collected from the wild, according to Michael Hastings, director of the Aquaculture Innovation Center in Brewer.
Great Eastern plans to spend about two weeks a year seeding the mussels, and another two weeks dragging them -- a noisy process that some Sorrento residents, such as John Dedam, aren't thrilled about.
Dedam, who lives on Treasure Island just south of the leased site, said he opposes the permit not just because of the noise but also because he has seen the aftermath of dragging and feels that it damages the ecology of the bay.
"It was almost like someone drove a bulldozer over it and pushed everything aside," said Dedam. He and his wife, Connie, a Sorrento selectman, asked the DMR to deny the permit at a public hearing in August. Dedam said he wasn't surprised, however, to learn last week that it had been approved.
The mussels will be unloaded at the Winter Harbor Marine Trading Co.
"It's a plus for us," said boat yard manager Ernest Rice. Rice said that though the effects of dragging may still be controversial, growing the mussels at least replenishes the supply.

Abstract: With demand growing for the bearded mollusk, several dozen Maine fishermen, fish farmers and other people are looking to capitalize on the trend. For a year now, they have been learning the method to produce prime mussels that has proved the most cost-effective in major mussel-producing nations such as Spain, Portugal and New Zealand. From Freeport to Eastport, 39 Mainers have been experimenting with gear used to grow mussels on ropes suspended from wooden rafts floating in the ocean. They see cultivation of the blue-black mollusks as a means to supplement their income at a time when scientists are warning that shrimp, lobsters, sea urchins and other marine resources are being overfished. Frenchboro lobsterman Daniel Lunt has fished for nearly two decades. In a year, he has raised mussels from seed to market size on ropes suspended from a wooden raft moored off the ferry terminal in Lunt's Harbor.

Full text: Steamed in white wine or served on the half shell as hors d'oeuvres, blue mussels have steadily gained in popularity among Americans and at fine restaurants across the United States.
With demand growing for the bearded mollusk, several dozen Maine fishermen, fish farmers and other people are looking to capitalize on the trend. For a year now, they have been learning the method to produce prime mussels that has proved the most cost-effective in major mussel-producing nations such as Spain, Portugal and New Zealand.
From Freeport to Eastport, 39 Mainers have been experimenting with gear used to grow mussels on ropes suspended from wooden rafts floating in the ocean. They see cultivation of the blue-black mollusks as a means to supplement their income at a time when scientists are warning that shrimp, lobsters, sea urchins and other marine resources are being overfished.
Frenchboro lobsterman Daniel Lunt has fished for nearly two decades. In a year, he has raised mussels from seed to market size on ropes suspended from a wooden raft moored off the ferry terminal in Lunt's Harbor.
"It would be a lot of work before it became someone's sole job. But it could be worked into a nice supplement pretty easy," Lunt summed up this week.
For a decade now, Brooklin resident Paul Brayton has been experimenting with suspension culture. A former mussel draggerman and seafood dealer, he is aiming to raise mussels on a commercial level starting next year.
Brayton says the beauty of raising mussels this way is the fact it doesn't involve feeding or treating the mollusks as has to be done in other types of aquaculture.
"All you are really doing is taking what nature is already producing and enhancing its opportunity to grow," he said this week.
Called suspension culture, fishermen collect mussel seed on ropes hanging from wooden rafts. Once enough seed has collected, the baby mollusks are fed into a hopper. They emerge from it in netlike socks, where they grow to market size suspended in the water. A raft measuring 20 by 24 feet can yield up to 300 bushels worth about $6,000. Currents, water temperature and site selection are key for such operations to succeed.
Suspension culture does require permits from both the Maine Department of Marine Resources and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Regulations for experimental aquaculture operations are being drafted by the DMR.
Maine's mussel fishery dates back at least a century. Traditionally, the mollusks have been harvested from the wild with hand rakes or by fishing vessels equipped with chain-sweep drags. In recent years, harvesters have been sewing mussel seed on the sea bottom to produce a meatier, better-quality product.
Over the past three decades, Maine's annual mussel landings have soared from 3,025 pounds worth $3,025 to 5.6 million pounds valued at $2 million, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service.
While the harvest has grown, Maine's top mussel processor and marketer says it has not been enough to meet growing demand for the tastier, thin-shelled mollusks sought by restaurants and supermarket chains across the United States.
"Demand has exceeded supply," Carter Newall, biologist and research and development coordinator at Great Eastern Mussel Farms in Tenants Harbor, reported this week.
In recent years, Great Eastern Mussel Farms has led the effort to produce higher-quality mussels. The company has been leasing sea bottom, sewing mussel seed and letting the mollusks develop to marketable size. Now, the company is promoting the even more profitable suspension culture.
Canada has invested research dollars to raise mussels using the rope-culture method in waters off Prince Edward Island. That province is now producing considerably more mussels than Maine. The cultivated creatures boast a greater meat-to-shell ratio, and thinner shells easier to crack open. They sell for 80 cents to $1 a pound.
"It's a real lesson for us. They have focused on development," Newall said. He said Maine needs to catch up.
Years ago, some Maine aquaculturists tried raising mussels on ropes suspended from floating rafts. The technique proved too labor-intensive. But the technology has been vastly improved since then.
Last year, Newall organized the Mussel Working Group made up of fishermen and other interested people to get rope culture under way in Maine waters. The initiative has been backed financially by the Island Institute in Rockland and the Brewer-based Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center.
Since last year, group members have been testing pot warp and other types of rope to determine what is suitable for Maine waters. They concluded a black rope with fuzzy strands -- resembling the branches of an artificial Christmas tree -- produced in New Zealand proved to be the most effective.
Island Institute supplied two experimental rafts while some fishermen and aquaculturists have built their own platforms. The Mussel Working Group also has acquired some Spanish equipment for shifting juvenile mussels from ropes to grow-out socks, and for declumping the harvested mollusks.
Newall says participants in the mussel project are aiming to grow mussel on a commercial scale within two years.
"This suspension technique offers traditional fishermen a potentially ideal way to supplement their income," he said.

Abstract: Officials in Waterville have been shaken in recent weeks by the discovery of large quantities of toxic mercury metal in an abandoned warehouse. It will ultimately cost thousands of dollars to effect a cleanup but the more worrisome aspect is its possible health effects on those who have been exposed to it for years. The majority are children who played in liquid metallic mercury at the site and often carried it home to contaminate their entire households. Many persons have now been left to wonder about the toxicity of mercury. The literature is full of horror stories regarding mercury poisoning that surfaces with such symptoms as severe nausea and pain, irregular gait, convulsions, mental disorientation, and death. One of the earliest documented examples of mercury posioning gave rise to the old saying, "mad as a hatter," and came from the symptoms exhibited by workers who used mercury compounds in the manufacture of felt hats years ago. In the 1950s more than 650 people died, and thousands fell ill, due to mercury from industrial waste pumped into Minamata Bay in Japan being taken up by fish and shellfish. Many of the most tragic victims were newborn children who suffered permanent brain damage and other birth defects due to the mother having eaten mercury-contaminated seafood while pregnant.

Full text:   Officials in Waterville have been shaken in recent weeks by the discovery of large quantities of toxic mercury metal in an abandoned warehouse. It will ultimately cost thousands of dollars to effect a cleanup but the more worrisome aspect is its possible health effects on those who have been exposed to it for years. The majority are children who played in liquid metallic mercury at the site and often carried it home to contaminate their entire households. Many persons have now been left to wonder about the toxicity of mercury.
The short answer is that it is extremely toxic both as a free element and in many of its compounds. For the next two weeks, this column will review the hazards of mercury and the poisonous effects it is having on the environment and people of Maine.
The literature is full of horror stories regarding mercury poisoning that surfaces with such symptoms as severe nausea and pain, irregular gait, convulsions, mental disorientation, and death. One of the earliest documented examples of mercury posioning gave rise to the old saying, "mad as a hatter," and came from the symptoms exhibited by workers who used mercury compounds in the manufacture of felt hats years ago. In the 1950s more than 650 people died, and thousands fell ill, due to mercury from industrial waste pumped into Minamata Bay in Japan being taken up by fish and shellfish. Many of the most tragic victims were newborn children who suffered permanent brain damage and other birth defects due to the mother having eaten mercury-contaminated seafood while pregnant.
A graphic example of just how poisonous mercury compounds can be happened at Dartmouth College this past June. Dr. Karen Wetterhahn, a professor of chemistry, died after spilling a few drops of the compound dimethylmercury on her hands. Even though she was wearing protective gloves enough of the deadly compound penetrated the latex, and was absorbed into the bloodstream, to cause her death.
Tons of waste mercury found its way into Maine's rivers during the early days of papermaking. Two compounds necessary for papermaking are chlorine and sodium hydroxide. These were prepared by breaking down a saturated brine solution in an electrolytic cell using mercury metal as the cathode. When the electrode was recharged, mercury sludge was simply dumped into the river on the assumption that the heavy liquid metal would settle deep into the silt of the river bottom out of harm's way. What was not understood at the time is that bacteria converts metallic mercury into water-soluble and fat-soluble forms of methyl mercury that work their way into the food chain and ultimately into Maine's birds and aquatic life. Mercury contamination is also due, in significant measure, to ash from coal-fired power plants in the central United States being borne eastward by prevailing winds and deposited in the northeast. Whatever the source, it is a fact of life that Maine's seemingly pristine wilderness is carrying a mercury burden that has rendered many gamefish unsafe to eat.
The following is a quotation from a 1997 advisory on fish consumption from the Bureau of Health of the Maine Department of Human Services: "Pregnant women, nursing mothers, women who may become pregnant, and children less than 8 years old, should NOT EAT warm water fish species (bass, pickerel, perch, sunfish, crappie) caught in any of Maine's inland surface waters. Consumption of cold water species (trout, salmon, smelt, cusk) should be limited to 1 meal per month. The consumption of older cold water fish (e.g. a large lake trout) should be avoided."
Persons not coming under the above categories should limit their consumption to 2 to 3 meals per month. This is a mercury advisory so, in essence, this toxic metal has placed much of Maine's gamefish off limits to a sizeable segment of the population. Next week's column will deal with the hazards of metallic mercury and some of the surprising places it turns up.
Clair Wood is the Bangor Daily News science columnist.

Abstract: Jennifer Litteral, the assistant harbor master in Bar Harbor, is looking forward to giving away hundreds of T-shirts when volunteers descend on the town to help haul garbage off the shore and out of the water. Bar Harbor had the largest turnout in the state for last year's annual Coastweek cleanup, with 250 volunteers. Those workers gathered 168 bags of garbage weighing 2,600 pounds, Litteral said, filling three dump trucks. Coastweek officially starts Saturday with beach cleanup efforts around the state and other activities continuing through Oct. 11. Bar Harbor will be hosting cruise ships on Oct. 4, Litteral said, and so had to pick Oct. 11 for its cleanup day.

Full text:   Jennifer Litteral, the assistant harbor master in Bar Harbor, is looking forward to giving away hundreds of T-shirts when volunteers descend on the town to help haul garbage off the shore and out of the water.
Bar Harbor had the largest turnout in the state for last year's annual Coastweek cleanup, with 250 volunteers. Those workers gathered 168 bags of garbage weighing 2,600 pounds, Litteral said, filling three dump trucks.
"It was so big last year, people were so into it, that I have a feeling we're going to get more people" this year, she said.
Coastweek officially starts Saturday with beach cleanup efforts around the state and other activities continuing through Oct. 11. Bar Harbor will be hosting cruise ships on Oct. 4, Litteral said, and so had to pick Oct. 11 for its cleanup day.
But Litteral is so confident about increased participation this year that she has ordered 350 shirts to give away to cleanup volunteers. The shirts feature artwork by Lulu Zhang, a third-grade pupil at the Conners School in Bar Harbor.
Bar Harbor also had last year's highest turnout of divers to help remove old tires, bottles, sunglasses and other debris from under the waves. Seventeen divers and eight boats participated in 1996.
Certified scuba divers need to bring nothing other than their desire to help, Litteral said. Wet suits and scuba gear all have been donated by Rockland Boat, Inc. of Southwest Harbor. Interested divers should contact the Bar Harbor harbor master's office at 288-5571 so workers there can make sure appropriate equipment is available.
The annual program is the biggest environmental event in Maine each year. In 1996, 3,123 people around the state each carried an average of about 10 pounds of garbage off Maine's shoreline, collecting a total of 30,806 pounds of litter -- about 126 pounds per mile.
Paul Dest, the Coastweek coordinator in the Maine State Planning Office, said turnout ultimately will depend on the weather. But he already has received an unprecedented number of calls from school groups this year, which may translate into more children helping clean the beaches.
Dest and local coordinators have scheduled events in most Maine counties, including cleanups at parks, beaches and along rivers. Some events focus solely on children, such as Saturday's event at Toothacher Cove on Swan's Island, sponsored by the Center Drive School.
Most events, however, are free and open to anyone who wants to participate as long as space allows.
Special events range from boat cruises and historical tours to underwater cleanups and opportunities to paint city streets. The Maine Chapter of the Sierra Club, for example, will offer participants an opportunity to protect waterways near Bangor and Portland from oil pollution.
Each year, motor oil is thrown away or spilled down driveways and parking lots into city storm drains, fouling rivers and coastal waters. On Saturday, Bangor volunteers will hit the streets to paint those storm drains with the message "Don't Dump: Drains to the River." For more information on the event, contact Matt Scease of the Sierra Club at 761-5616.
Other special events include a presentation by ecologist and former commercial fisherman Sherman Hoyt on cooperative efforts that led to the opening of shellfish beds in the St. Georges River at 7 p.m. Friday at the Penobscot Marine Museum in Searsport.
The Hurricane Island Outward Bound School will host two free one-hour cruises around Rockland Harbor Saturday. The boats will accept passengers on a first-come, first-served basis and leave at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. from the Rockland Pier.
Other cruises, with park naturalists from Acadia National Park on board, leave daily during the week from Northeast Harbor and Bar Harbor. For more information about the trips, call 276-5352 for the Islesford historical cruise out of Northeast Harbor, or 288-3322 for the Frenchman Bay Nature Cruise out of Bar Harbor. Prices for the trips range from $12 to $15 for adults, and reservations are recommended.
Rangers from Acadia National Park offer special programs during the week, including hawk watching, easy walks and presentations about geology and fall foliage.
The Maine State Museum in Augusta offers a variety of programs, including a hands-on look at lobsters and how they are caught, an examination of creatures that live in tide pools, and an opportunity to sew sails using traditional tools.

Species migration

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]29 Sep 1997: 1.

Abstract: I greatly appreciated Clair Wood's recent column {Sept. 19} concerning species migration as a global threat. While he stated that little is being done and federal laws allow importation of species until it becomes a problem, in fact, certain federal agencies are very concerned with the accidental introduction of exotic species. Congress passed HR 4283, the Invasive Aquatic Species Act, in October 1996 that mandates the U.S. Coast Guard to monitor ballast water discharge from large ships while at U.S. poarts, and to have ships voluntarily comply with the practice of exchanging ballast water from foreign ports in the open ocean in depths over 10,000 feet deep, to help prevent the accidental introduction of exotic species to the United States. This fact also requires that scientific panels be set up for several areas to conduct research to determine invasions and the best methods of reducing new invasions.

Full text: I greatly appreciated Clair Wood's recent column {Sept. 19} concerning species migration as a global threat. While he stated that little is being done and federal laws allow importation of species until it becomes a problem, in fact, certain federal agencies are very concerned with the accidental introduction of exotic species. Congress passed HR 4283, the Invasive Aquatic Species Act, in October 1996 that mandates the U.S. Coast Guard to monitor ballast water discharge from large ships while at U.S. poarts, and to have ships voluntarily comply with the practice of exchanging ballast water from foreign ports in the open ocean in depths over 10,000 feet deep, to help prevent the accidental introduction of exotic species to the United States. This fact also requires that scientific panels be set up for several areas to conduct research to determine invasions and the best methods of reducing new invasions.
In March, the Quoddy Spill Prevention Group, a volunteer organizaton concerned with environmental issues of the Quoddy region in Down East Maine, held a forum at which representatives from 17 Canadian and 12 American agencies and ports were present to discuss methods of control and amelioration of exotic species to the Gulf of Maine and to discuss the impact the new federal bill might have on shipping. The QSPG sponsored a presentation at the Gulf of Maine Marine Council (GOMMC) at Campobello, New Brunswick, in June during which the Coast Guard gave a very professional presentation of their role in carrying out the new federal laws. The GOMMC, consisting of government officials from the states and provinces surrounding the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine, are addressing the issue of setting up a scientific panel fo the Gulf of Maine to study this probelm. Dr. Jim Carlton of Wilson College in Mystic Conn., the world's foremost authority on accidental introduction via ballast water, has documented at least seven exotic species in the Gulf of Maine during the last decade, and has stated that there will be at least one new damaging introduction to the gulf before the year 2000.
The wheels of federal and state bureaucratics can grind very slowly but at least they are in motion. There have been several horror stories on a global scale, including the deaths of 50,000 people in Peru who were killed by cholera introduced in 1991 from the Amazon River by a freighter, the closing of all Gulf of Mexico oyster harvests due to the introduction of this same virus in the mid-1990s, as well as the familiar zebra mussel introduction to the Great Lakes. With the passing of HR 4283, at least the issue is being recognized and addressed, and hopefully in the near future these accidental introductions can be significantly reduced. Steve Crawford Chairman Quoddy Spill Prevention Group Eastport

Full text: BLUE HILL -- Garrett Poole is in a class by himself.
On Wednesday, the 15-year-old freshman from Brooklin arrived for his first day of class to find himself the object of individual attention personified, as the sole student enrolled in "Real Math."
No problem, said teacher Larry Reynolds, who spent the next 70 minutes seated at a small wooden table with Garrett, with whom he reviewed basic algebra, even as power tools whined just outside the window.
Wednesday was opening day at the Liberty School, the latest pioneering effort in secondary education in Maine. The new high school seeks to provide students with plenty of individual attention and more than a measure of independence, commodities some say are wanting in more traditional education.
The school is the brainchild of co-founder and acting director Arnold Greenberg, best known as founder and former owner of the Left Bank Cafe, a funky local venue attracting nationally known performers.
"This is great. The kids are really high -- very excited about their classes," said Greenberg, a former educator who is teaching a variety of courses including tap dancing, one of his specialties.
A published poet and author of a book on education, Greenberg served in administrative posts at other alternative schools in the Northeast for many years before coming to Blue Hill more than a decade ago.
As a self-described "democratic learning community," the Liberty School has enrolled 40 students presumably seeking greater autonomy as they pursue their educations.
That would be true for Garrett Poole, whose parents home-schooled him and enrolled him in a Christian school before this year.
"Here, the students are not going to sit at school for eight hours and get 45 minutes of education," said Garrett's father, Gerard Poole, a shellfish dealer known for his independent views. He likes the idea that his son can design his education according to his own interests.
Nonetheless, as a parent, the elder Poole knows some of his more traditional peers are skeptical of an open-campus school like Liberty. "I've heard all kinds of comments that this will be some kind of hippie or yuppie school. And believe me, I'm neither, as you can tell by looking at me."
Wearing beads and bell-bottoms, 16-year-old junior Bethany Sargent of Blue Hill agrees that observers need to see beyond stereotypes.
"I think it's been viewed because we don't have grades that it's gonna be a bunch of people who want to slack off and don't want to work," Sargent said. "But our evaluations will tell us our weaknesses and strengths, and because we'll be self-motivated, it's going to be a lot harder."
Sargent has served since last spring on the school's community council, an organization including students, faculty and administrators that will set school policy and make decisions on day-to-day affairs.
Formerly enrolled in the local high school in Blue Hill, the student who lists her special interests as art and music craves more individual attention.
"I went to George Stevens Academy for two years," said Sargent. It's a pretty good school, but there's so many students that it's hard for the teachers to work one-on-one, which is what a lot of students need."
Sargent's first class Wednesday was an independent study course on the 1960s with half-time humanities teacher Robin Furth, one of two Liberty instructors who taught at Surry Elementary School before making the switch.
"Where I taught, there were many fine teachers, and I believe in public education. But I thought I'd really like to work with older students in an alternative setting," explained Furth, a poet whose special interests are World War II and the 1960s.
As one of Liberty's seven regular teachers, Furth likes the greater freedom of students to choose their own courses and craft independent studies. "I have high hopes and dreams for the school. Time will tell," she said.
Describing himself as a teacher with four courses and 400 ideas, Reynolds has high aspirations as well.
"I spent last year teaching in Africa. I had a great time, and I was at a school where the people treated me excellently. I want to take some of you and go back there," Reynolds told Liberty School students this week. He has suggested students take a school trip to Africa to get to know the people and the landscape.
A pilot, Reynolds also will teach an aviation course for which 12 students already have signed up. As is true with all courses, the class will teach a blend of practical skills, including navigation and flying, as well as attempt to put the subject in perspective -- in this case through the literature of flying by authors like Antoine de Saint-Exupery.
In the meantime, school organizers have some very down-to-earth concerns to worry about. The state Department of Education has not designated Liberty as eligible to receive tuition, due to some unresolved issues including certification that state officials identified during a site visit last week. Greenberg hopes to achieve a tuition-eligible designation Sept. 30, when officials will visit again.
The school's goal is to raise about $175,000 toward capital expenses this year. But its operations will depend primarily on tuition, as will all but a handful of students, said Greenberg.
As a maverick enterprise in education, the Liberty School will without doubt operate in a fishbowl, Greenberg said this week.
"We have a responsibility to other students in other schools to demonstrate that students can be trusted and have freedom," said the school director. "I just feel very confident we're going to make a big dent in education in Maine."

Full text: AUGUSTA -- A marine biotechnology company that was recently founded in Bar Harbor, AquaBio Products Sciences, announced Wednesday that it had formed a strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical company in Utah that promises to boost the number of its employees from two to 20 in the next year.
Dr. Ira Levine, the chief operating officer of AquaBio Products, said at a press conference in Augusta that research by the small start-up firm has resulted in "basic technologies that will certainly lead to hundreds of millions of dollars of sales in pharmaceuticals" for the Utah company, NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The Bar Harbor company is housed at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory and was founded by three Harvard Medical School colleagues: Dr. William Harris, Dr. Edward Brown, and Dr. Steve Hebert.
The company does research on fish and other marine species, identifying the sensors that control the metabolism of calcium. This research, Levine said, had led to potential commercial applications in the health care industry. AquaBio is developing drugs that may be used by NPS Pharmaceuticals to treat calcium-related health problems, such as osteoporosis and thyroid problems.
Levine also said that the research into calcium metabolism can be commercially applied in the aquaculture industry, improving the growth of fish, shellfish, and sea vegetables.
AquaBio, which is valued at about $4 million, has already signed a contract to use its research to improve production at Great Bay Aqua Farms, a sushi producer in New Hampshire, said Levine.
Gov. Angus King, who attended the announcement of the partnership, said it represents "exactly the kind of new industry that we want to attract to Maine" and "puts Maine at the forefront of marine biotechnology innovation."

Abstract: Gov. Angus King is a polished media personality, but Saturday, during Eastport Port Days, he was upstaged by diminutive Molly King, his charming daughter, who will turn 4 on Friday. While waiting for her father to take his turn at the podium, Molly King was busy eating oyster crackers and writing on the program with a pen. Occasionally, Molly had a short comment, but for the most part, her dark brown eyes were focused on her artistic efforts. The governor and U.S. Rep. John Baldacci were in Eastport Saturday to help celebrate construction of the $15 million port at Estes Head. The port will replace a smaller downtown port and will allow for more shipping traffic in and out of Eastport. Currently, shipping in the downtown port is primarily related to pulp from Georgia Pacific Corp. of Baileyville. The port, expected to be open in July 1998, has been designed to broaden the types of goods and materials shipped in and out of Eastport.

Full text: EASTPORT -- Gov. Angus King is a polished media personality, but Saturday, during Eastport Port Days, he was upstaged by diminutive Molly King, his charming daughter, who will turn 4 on Friday.
While waiting for her father to take his turn at the podium, Molly King was busy eating oyster crackers and writing on the program with a pen. Occasionally, Molly had a short comment, but for the most part, her dark brown eyes were focused on her artistic efforts.
When it was the governor's turn to speak, he acknowledged his young daughter's activity. "Well now you know, governors' kids squirm too," he told an attentive audience of more than 150 people.
The governor and U.S. Rep. John Baldacci were in Eastport Saturday to help celebrate construction of the $15 million port at Estes Head. The port will replace a smaller downtown port and will allow for more shipping traffic in and out of Eastport. Currently, shipping in the downtown port is primarily related to pulp from Georgia Pacific Corp. of Baileyville. The port, expected to be open in July 1998, has been designed to broaden the types of goods and materials shipped in and out of Eastport.
"I want to congratulate everyone who made this new port happen, the people who supported the bond issue, the legislators who supported it and the people from the Department of Transportation," the governor said.
King, who sprinkled his talk with levity, related an incident several weeks ago that focused on the statewide demand for infrastructure improvements and lower taxes. "I was north of here, this is an absolutely true story, and I went into a little general store and a lady was behind the counter. She saw me come in and said `Hah, it's Mr. Tax Man,' and then practically in the next breath she said, `Which way are you going.' I said south. She said, `Good, I hope you have a bumpy ride so you fix that road," King said.
He said the project at Estes Head is on schedule and within budget.
King said that efforts like the port project required a partnership among local, state and federal officials. He said it was that kind of partnership that made Estes Head a reality.
The pier's original design called for a 634-foot, two-berth pier that would accommodate a ship up to 900 feet long on the outer side, which will have a water depth of 65 feet at mean low water, and a second vessel up to 550 feet long on the inner berth, where the water depth is 40 feet at mean low water.
When construction began, the port authority had $13.5 million to spend on the project, only enough to build a 574-foot, single-berth pier.
Early this winter, the Eastport City Council gave the port authority permission to borrow an additional $821,000 to extend the pier to its two-berth potential,
The governor predicted that during the next 10 years, Washington County residents would have to grapple with the issue of how to maintain the quality of life in the face of economic growth.
"How do we keep what we love about this place while at the same time we are growing. This is already an issue in southern Maine. That is something we will have to address. ... We are very lucky that we are not the coast of New Jersey. But we have to be careful to be more thoughtful than they were 50 or 100 years ago in developing the coast to the south of us. We must maintain this incredible place and what is attractive to us and at the same time develop so people can make a decent living," King said.
John Baldacci echoed King's enthusiasm for the new port and the theme of partnership that made Estes Head a reality.
"It doesn't take just one person to do something. Our entire {U.S. congressional} delegation, the governor, all the local officials, state legislators and state senators who are here today and all of you are what it took to make it a success," he said of Estes Head.
Baldacci said that under the House of Representative's transportation funding formula, the state should receive $17 million a year.

Full text: PORTLAND -- Cleaner waters could mean the return of clam digging at Lamson Cove on Little Diamond Island and two other islands near Portland.
Environmentalists and scientists began sifting through the muddy cove last week for soft-shell clams.
If the clams they find turn out to be as clean as the water is, some islanders could soon enjoy a coastal rite that has been illegal in their locales for decades.
They can start digging their own steamers and chowder clams.
The reopened clam flats -- including some within Portland city limits -- also would be a symbolic achievement in the effort to reverse coastal pollution.
Joseph Payne, baykeeper for the nonprofit Friends of Casco Bay, led digging excursions to three Portland island shellfish beds in the past two weeks in an effort to blow holes in a shellfishing ban that stretches across the whole southern end of Casco Bay.
"All of this has been closed for as long as anyone can remember," Payne said. "It's a part of our heritage that's been lost."
The state is considering opening some clam flats on Peaks and Cliff islands, and between Little Diamond and Great Diamond islands.
There aren't many islanders who remember getting clams from the flats, at least not legally. It's not even clear when the bans started here, but it probably was even before the end of the steamship era.
"I think Portland has been closed a long time, probably back into the 1930s," said John Hurst, marine resources scientist at the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The area was definitely closed when he started the job in 1951, Hurst said.
Shellfish tend to accumulate whatever pollutants are flowing into the water, including bacteria from sewage that can make people sick. And it was obvious in the 1950s that Maine's rivers and coastal waters contained untreated sewage. The waste was easy to see and smell, said Hurst. The tide turned in the 1960s and 1970s. Landmark cleanup laws were passed. Communities built their first sewage treatment plants and began to focus on industrial discharges.

Full text: MACHIAS -- Thirty guidance counselors representing high schools from as far away as Idaho, Wisconsin and New York took a close look at the college programs and campus setting of the University of Maine at Machias on Aug. 7. In addition to a tour of UMM, they visited Beals Island Shellfish Hatchery and Roosevelt Campobello International Park to become acquainted with a region known for its unique rural lifestyle.
David Baldwin, director of admissions on the Down East campus, said the Machias visit was the fourth on the group's weeklong tour of college campuses in the state. The program is sponsored annually by the Down East Consortium of Maine Colleges as a way to acquaint guidance counselors with postsecondary educational opportunities in Maine that are available to high school graduates.
Members of the consortium, in addition to UMM, are Husson College, Maine Maritime Academy, Colby College and the College of the Atlantic. Each has its specialty programs and each its particular Maine setting, Baldwin said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Seafood consumption in the United States remained steady in 1996, with 3.9 billion pounds eaten. This equated to 14.8 pounds of seafood per person.
Americans have eaten about 15 pounds of seafood per year since 1990, according to officials from the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration.
Of the 14.8 pounds of seafood eaten per person in 1996, it was estimated that 10.0 pounds were fresh or frozen fish or shellfish, 4.5 pounds were canned seafood, and 0.3 pounds of seafood was cured.

Fish catch earnings dip in '96 For 3rd year, Maine leads Eastern Seaboard states in value of haul

Full text: PORTLAND -- Government regulations and declining fish stocks sank the financial haul for fishermen along the Eastern Seaboard last year, federal officials said Thursday.
Revenues from commercial fisheries from Maine to Virginia last year totaled $939.9 million, down 4 percent, or $43 million, compared with 1995. The decrease is the first after several years of steady increases in fishermen's earnings.
Jon Gibson, spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said the decline was due to several factors.
"For some species of fish there are smaller populations, so fishermen aren't catching as much. And because there are small populations, there are more fishery management regulations."
For the third year in a row, Maine led the 10-state region with $247.9 million in revenue. Massachusetts followed with $231.4 million, Gibson said.
Before 1994, Massachusetts had always taken first place.
Maine was able to retain its top position because it has a large number of high-value species, including lobster and salmon, and because fishermen in Maine land more than 50 different species, like sea worms, sea urchins and hagfish. "Maine's diversity has played a key role in its ability to maintain high revenue year after year," Gibson said.
But for Maine fishermen, 1996 was not a good year compared with the year before. Revenue for fishermen in Maine decreased by 9 percent compared with 1995, largely because of a reduction in sea urchin landings and lower prices for farm-raised Atlantic salmon.
"When the sea urchin fishery started years ago it was a virgin population, so of course catch rates are going to go down," Gibson said.
Only two states -- Massachusetts and New York -- showed an increase in revenue. Rhode Island remained the same at $70.7 million. And the six other states -- New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Delaware -- all showed decreases.
Of all the fisheries, lobster was once again the top moneymaker.
New England harvested 71.4 million pounds of lobster worth $242.2 million in 1996, a 13 percent increase since 1995. But lobstermen only caught 1.4 million more pounds of lobster, showing a significant increase in the cost per pound, Gibson said.
Maine accounted for 44 percent of the lobster harvest, Massachusetts had 27 percent and New York trailed with 13 percent. The remaining 12 percent was divided among Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire and New Jersey.
Sea scallops trailed behind lobster with 17 million pounds worth $96 million, and blue crab collected $62.6 million -- down from $75 million in 1995.
Other top moneymakers were Atlantic salmon, surf clams, menhaden, eastern oyster and goosefish. However, all of those species earned less in 1996 than in 1995.
Fishermen in the mid-Atlantic area took in less money last year partly because of decreased landings of menhaden, an industrial fish used in fish meal and fish oil. In 1996, fishermen caught 615.9 million pounds of menhaden worth $37.3 million dollars, compared with 752.6 million pounds in 1995, worth $45 million.
There was no change in revenue for New England groundfish, which have been heavily regulated to try and bring back dwindling stocks. The Northeast's three traditional groundfish species -- cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder -- collectively accounted for revenues of $35.8 million in both 1996 and 1995.
Fishery revenue and weight, 1996
Here's a list of commercial fisheries revenue and weight in 1996 for states from Maine to Virginia in millions of dollars and millions of pounds:
Maine -- $247.9; 259.7 pounds.
Massachusetts -- $231.4; 236.7.
New Jersey -- $94; 179.3.
Virginia -- $90.4; 629.7.
New York -- $86.7; 61.3.
Rhode Island -- $70.7; 137.5.
Maryland -- $52.5; 69.
Connecticut -- $48.4; 20.9.
New Hampshire -- $13.5; 11.1.
Delaware -- $4.3; 5.7.
Total: $939.9; 1,611.

Full text: Since August has been designated the official Maine lobster month, I love to fish out more ways to consume my favorite crustacean, Homarus americanus.
When I heard through the grapevine that one of Bangor's popular restaurants, the Oriental Jade, was serving lobster 10 ways, I swallowed the bait and contacted Lilian Lo, who, with her husband Victor, owns and operates both the Oriental Jade in Bangor and Noodles and Company in Brewer. After explaining my interest in eating something new and expanding my knowledge of the world's cuisines, Lilian and Victor graciously invited me into their restaurant kitchen to experience firsthand some facets of Chinese-style cooking.
I was fascinated to learn that the combined cuisines of China have often been compared with French cuisine as having made the greatest contribution to the world of food. Chinese cooking styles have been divided into five main regions: Southeastern (Canton), East Coast (Fukien), Northeastern (Peking-Shantung), Central (Honan), and Western (Szechwan-Hunan). Lilian explained to me that the styles used at the Oriental Jade and Noodles and Company are Southeastern and Northeastern (Canton and Peking-Shantung) as New England people enjoy these best.
An excellent chef himself, Victor related that the keys to Chinese cooking are fresh ingredients and organization. He proudly escorted me through his gleaming kitchen with its 13 wok stations, stainless-steel work tables for vegetable preparation, electronically controlled Fryolators and a huge pot for making chicken stock. Because of careful organization, a Chinese restaurant can prepare an enormous number of elaborate dishes within a short time. The Oriental Jade's 12 chefs and 75 staff members prepare food for more than 5,000 people every week in the largest Chinese kitchen north of Boston.
With the exception of the egg roll and spring roll wrappers and five kinds of fresh noodles that are delivered from New York three times per week, everything else is prepared by hand in this kitchen. Chicken stock is made fresh every day, and unlike European-style broth, it is just the pure, rich taste of chicken with an undercurrent of ginger. Vegetables, meat and seafood are delivered fresh daily. The staff spends hours chopping, mincing and slicing.
The traditions of Chinese cooking maintain that all good dishes are based on three elements: color, aroma and flavor. In today's health-conscious society, we should also add one more element: nutrition. Chinese cooking is very healthful.
A good Chinese cook is an artist, and I had the pleasure of watching John Lee, the head chef, create this masterpiece, Lobster Scampi Lo Mein.
Lobster Scampi Lo Mein
5 ounces fresh lobster meat 2 ounces zucchini, sliced 8 ounces fresh egg noodles 6 ounces chicken stock 2 ounces light cream 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil 10 medium mushrooms, sliced 1 ounce Spanish onion, diced 2 scallions, chopped 1 teaspoon dry sherry 1/2 teaspoon salt dash of white pepper 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon roux (melt 2 tablespoons of butter over low heat with 2 tablespoons flour)
Heat 3 quarts of water until boiling. Add noodles and cook until tender, about three to four minutes. Drain well and keep warm on a pasta dish.
Heat the oil in a wok until hot. Sear the lobster on all sides and remove from wok.
Add the onions to the hot oil and stir-fry for 15 seconds. Add garlic, zucchini, mushrooms and sherry and stir-fry for one minute. Add chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add salt, sugar, white pepper. Add scallions, flour mixture. Blend well. Add cream and lobster meat.
Serve lobster and vegetables over cooked noodles.
The aroma was fresh, pleasant and inviting. The flavors were a perfect combination of buttery noodles, crisp vegetables, sweet onion and garlic and delectable lobster. Chinese people like a sense of harmony and balance in their foods, and watching John Lee in motion was like observing a fine musician in love with his music.
The most common techniques in Chinese cooking are stir-frying, deep-frying, steaming, braising and poaching. Victor cautioned me that home cooking is different than his restaurant cooking because of the temperature of the wok. Temperature is critical in stir-frying because the rapid and intense cooking preserves the texture and vitamin content of foods. Indeed, as I watched the dazzling motions of his chefs preparing a dish, spatulas in both hands and regulating the gas nozzles for the woks with their knees, I was impressed.
Up until just a few years ago, very few Chinese kitchens had traditional style ovens. Steaming was one of the most-used, straightforward, energy-saving cooking techniques. Lilian's favorite lobster preparation is the steamed Maineland lobster, which she describes as a traditional Maine favorite with an international reputation. I found it to be simple yet admirable, understated yet memorable -- the very essence of Chinese cooking.
Steamed Maineland Lobster
1 1 1/4-pound Maine lobster 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar 4 slices fresh ginger 1/2 lemon, sliced
Remove lobster head, discard legs and remove claws, cracking them with the back of the cleaver. Cut lobster tail lengthwise and into chunks. Mix lobster with salt and sugar. Place a deep dish in a bamboo steamer. Arrange lobster in the bamboo steamer, top with lemon slices and fresh ginger. Steam for 12 minutes. Serve immediately.
In China, seafood is abundant and treated with great reverence, according to Lilian. While lobster is not served everyday, it is often served at celebrations and always on New Year's. For your special occasions, the chefs at the Oriental Jade, with 48 hours notice, will prepare such mouthwatering delicacies as Easter Lobster Rolls, Lobster Polynesian Salad, Lobster Seafood Soup and Lobster Lychee.
The Chinese have a healthy respect for food and know that good eating is always a matter of good cooking. In the preparation of Maine Lobster Hong Kong, cornstarch is used to coat the lobster to seal in the natural juices and keep the lobster in its shell during the baking process.
Maine Lobster Hong Kong
1 1 1/4-pound lobster 4 scallions cut into 2-inch sections (separate green and white sections) 2 teaspoons soy sauce 1/2 teaspoon oyster sauce 10 slices of fresh ginger 2 tablespoons rice wine or sherry 6 ounces chicken stock 1 teaspoon sugar 1/8 teaspoon white pepper cornstarch: enough to cover the lobster vegetable oil: enough to cover the lobster for blanching cornstarch liquid (1 teaspoon cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon soy sauce mixed with 1 tablespoon of water)
Cut lobster lengthwise and discard organs. Chop lobster into chunks, remove claws and crack the shell of the claws with the back of the cleaver. Put chunks of lobster in medium strainer.
Dust lobster chunks with cornstarch.
In a wok, heat vegetable oil until hot, blanch lobster in hot oil for 2 minutes, remove and drain.
Remove all excess oil, leaving 1 tablespoon of oil in wok. Add ginger slices and white scallions and stir-fry for 10 seconds. Add lobster chunks, splash in rice wine, then stir-fry for 10 seconds. Add chicken stock and remaining seasoning, cover and bake in wok for one minute. Remove wok cover and add cornstarch liquid to finish. Add green scallions and stir-fry until shiny and smooth.
Dining Chinese-style is always a memorable communal experience. During the Oriental Jade's month-long celebration of Maine lobster, your family and friends may enjoy 10 different preparations of lobster including Luxurious Lobster Fried Rice, Lobster Cantonese, Lobster Wor Bar and Maine Lobster Wor Bar. Each dish will be individually prepared to order, the composition an unconscious yin and yang presented in conspicuous juxtaposition.
Over the centuries, alternately buffeted by famine and blessed with the splendors of a great civilization, the Chinese have experimented with all things edible both for sheer survival and to perfect their cooking techniques for sensual enjoyment. Their food, with its rare delicacy and rustic simplicity, has sustained a culture for more than 2,000 years and has journeyed well all over the world. I feel very fortunate that it has traveled to Bangor and I have had the opportunity to meet the able team of Lilian and Victor Lo, to experience their labors of love in the meeting of East and West with the Oriental Jade's Maine lobster cuisine.

Fest ritual steams PETA Boiling death `excruciating' for lobsters, says group

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Fortunately for the Maine Lobster Festival there are a lot more people who love eating lobsters than allowing them to swim free.
As thousands of festival-goers sat munching on their succulent cooked crustaceans Friday afternoon, protesters from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals reminded as many as they could that "Being Boiled Hurts."
Accompanied by a guy in a lobster costume with a cauldron wrapped around his belly, PETA spokeswoman Dawn Carr urged the public to give lobsters a chance. "There is no humane way to kill a lobster," she said.
Though PETA members usually concentrate their animal protection efforts on testing laboratories, once a year they announce being "steaming mad" over the annual festival and abandon their sweltering Virginia headquarters for the cool coast of Maine. Carr said they also make appearances at sport fishing tournaments.
Perhaps PETA's efforts are beginning to pay off. According to the latest figures provided Friday by the U.S. Commerce Department, Americans consumed 3.9 billion pounds of seafood during 1996. That represents a per-capita consumption level of 14.8 pounds per person, which is a modest decrease of 0.2 pound from the 1995 level. Still, Americans have consumed about 15 pounds of seafood per-capita each year since 1990.
Of the seafood consumed per person in 1996, 10 pounds were fresh or frozen fresh or shellfish, 4.5 pounds were canned seafood and .3 pounds were cured. Imported fish and shellfish comprised 57 percent of the seafood consumed in the United States last year, a 3 percent increase from 1995's imports.
While the 50,000 or so people expected to visit the four-day festival come to Rockland for the food and fun, PETA is dead serious about protecting the lobster. As anyone who has ever dropped a lobster into a pot of boiling water can see, they point out, lobsters die while trying to scratch and claw their way to freedom.
"We are here to suggest that people no longer eat lobster," Carr said. "Lobsters experience excruciating suffering when put in a pot of boiling water."
Carr said that PETA wants mankind to exhibit "compassion to even the smallest, oddest animal. We will fight for any animal alive. No one would accept someone torturing a lobster, yet that is exactly what is being done here today."
Carr suggested that the 50,000 lobster lovers must be victims of a "mass cultural state of denial" by returning to the festival year after year. She pledged that PETA would continue its protest until the tastes are changed forever.
"Just because something has gone on for a long time does not mean that it must endure," she said. "We have to continue to question these practices."

Full text: WARREN - An Old Town man took first place among 24 competitors at the Maine State Highpower Rifle Championship held July 19 at the Oyster River Range, and won an excellence in competition match run by the U.S. Department of Civilian Marksmanship the following day.
David Dow fired a score of 778 out of 800 possible points in the match, which included stages at 200, 300 and 600 yards and positions including off-hand, sitting and prone.
The second high-scoring shooter was Emery Bassett of Essex Junction, Vt., who fired a 764, taking first master honors.
Bassett did not qualify for overall second-place in the match, however, because he is not a Maine resident. That award went to Harry Davis of Freeport, who fired 752.
Mac Daggett of Thomaston fired the top score for the Match Rifle category, separate from the service rifle classification, firing a score of 747.
Other winners and scores were Harry Davis, first expert, 752; David Yates of South Paris, first sharpshooter, 706; Denis Paine of Topsham, first marksman, 701; Sam Overlock, 17, of Warren, first junior, 706.
Dow fired a 470 of 500 possible points in the excellence in competition match held July 20 at the Oyster River Range. Scoring second-place was Scott Folsom of Hampden, with a score of 468. The match is a qualification event in which shooters seek classification as distinguished shooters by the DCM.

Heartfelt thoughts shared on EMMC anniversary Hospital's first bypass conducted 10 years ago

Full text: BANGOR -- Linwood and Verda LeClair remember what it was like to travel to Boston for heart surgery. The Bangor couple also know the convenience of cardiac care close to home.
On Tuesday, the 10th anniversary of the first heart bypass in Bangor, the LeClairs joined other former patients, doctors and nurses at Eastern Maine Medical Center for a celebration and a look back.
A dozen years ago, while the community was still fighting for the state's permission to build a heart center north of Portland, Linwood LeClair found himself in need of angioplasty. The procedure opens clogged arteries by inserting and inflating tiny balloons, clearing away debris to let blood pass to the heart.
LeClair went to Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, where his surgery was postponed for a week because of incoming emergencies. "I had to go down and find myself a room," his wife recalled. "It was a difficult experience."
Coming back to Maine, they stayed one step ahead of a hurricane. Verda LeClair worried about the storm, and her husband.
"It's horrendous driving in Boston when you're well, let alone after surgery, when you're weak," she said.
Fortunately for the LeClairs, EMMC was an option by the time Linwood needed more heart surgery 2 1/2 years later. He is one of nearly 5,000 patients to undergo coronary bypass at the facility in the last decade. About 5,000 others have had angioplasty.
Nowadays, it's hard to remember the time, not so long ago, when heart patients were placed on waiting lists in Portland and routinely transported hundreds of miles by ambulance, while some legislators and state officials insisted Maine didn't need a second heart center.
But Bangor had a stubborn handful of leaders who wouldn't take no for an answer, whose persistence paid off after months of hard work and some dark hours. Jack Kelsey was a member of a YMCA exercise group for cardiac patients who took the heart center on as a personal mission.
In May 1985 with other members of his fitness group, Kelsey delivered bags of petitions bearing 10,000 signatures to the governor's office in Augusta. He was told to deliver them elsewhere.
"We walked in with the media and we were asked to leave," he remembered Tuesday, speaking under a tent on the hospital lawn near the Riverside Inn. "I said to the man, `You're going to ask five people who've had open heart surgery to carry this someplace else?'
"I guess we hit the right key, because suddenly people became very aware of the need for heart surgery right here."
Around the edges of the tent, medical staff members displayed heart models and diagrams and explained surgical instruments used in a bypass, where another vessel -- often a leg vein -- is moved to the heart to help blood flow there. An X-ray technician held a lightweight, modern-day pacemaker as small as a silver dollar next to an older, much larger model almost the size of a Walkman.
Behind the podium hung rows of small quilts made by hospital staff to mark the heart center's anniversary. One featured the traditional heart shape in its center; another had a red cloth blob more like the organ's squishy reality.
Dr. Robert Clough, hired from Texas 10 years ago to lead the new heart program, was on hand Tuesday to thank his first patient, Lee Turner of Shirley Mills, who underwent a triple bypass July 22, 1987.
Since then, the number of cardiologists has increased to 14, the number of heart surgeons to three, a second operating room has been added with talk of a third, and the number of annual surgeries has grown from 300 the first year to 700 in 1996, he said.
"Someone once said it was a brave man who ate the first oyster," Clough said. "I've often wondered what kind of man is it who puts his heart in the hand of a surgeon from away."
News stories at the time reported Turner's first words after surgery as "I want to go fishing." Tuesday, the 75-year-old celebrity said he remembers being wheeled to the operating room -- and, thankfully, nothing more. "I was pretty tickled," he said of his role in EMMC history.
His good health today lets him enjoy life near Moosehead Lake.
"If I want to go mow the lawn, I mow the lawn. If I want to get down under a car and work on it, I do. I shovel snow, I feed the squirrels," he said.
More good news was offered by Dr. Robert Hoffman, who said heart disease rates are starting to fall as the public starts to understand prevention and the roles of smoking, exercise and cholesterol. Such progress will take years to make a real difference.
"Clearly prevention is the future of cardiology," he said. "Does that mean the heart center will close in five years? Not likely."

Full text: PRESCHOOL, KINDERGARTEN
IS IT TIME? by Marilyn Janovitz, New York: North-South Books, 1994 and 1996 hardcover, 32 pages, $12.95, paperback $5.95.
This bouncy, rhyming story about a father wolf getting his wolf cub ready for bed is one that may actually help to make a parent and child's nighttime experience quite a pleasant one. Checking his watch often, the father wolf guides his young wolf with questions throughout the story taking him from a nice, bubbly bath to being finally tucked in only after the wolf cub has brushed his "fangs" and given a "howl."
Colored pencils and watercolors combine to create soft, airy drawings that complement the light rhythm of Marilyn Janovitz's text. A question-answer format will invite a positive response from the listener or reader. Especially fun will be the "chiming-in" for the howling. If in a creative mood, children and their parents might even create original rhymes particular to their own evening routines using the pattern established in the story. Repetitive lines with a playful spirit will engage pre-readers and beginning readers encouraging their early reading skills.
Is it time to read a book? Yes, it's time to read this book!
GRADES ONE-THREE
POLAR, THE TITANIC BEAR by Daisy C.S. Spedden, illustrated by Laurie McGaw, Little, 1995, 64 pages, $17.95.
Imagine the excitement of discovery as you look through a relative's soon to be discarded old trunk and find a true children's story of the Titanic, a story as experienced by an F.A.O. Schwartz Steiff polar bear! Leighton H. Coleman graciously shares this charming treasure, as he discovered it, adding facts and insights into a long lost era.
Daisy Corning Stone Spidden wrote this short story for her 8-year-old son Douglas as a Christmas present in 1913. It recounts the traveling adventures of young Douglas and his favorite stuffed animal, "Polar." They sail to Madeira where Douglas gets measles. He is quarantined and Polar suffers the indignity of a disinfectant bath. The pair go sledding at their home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., and play on the beach at their summer home in Bar Harbor. When the weather once again turns cold they're off to Algiers. Slowly, they make their way home, stopping at Monte Carlo, Paris, Cannes and finally in Cherbourg, France, where they are to board the new wonder ship the Titanic.
The book is interspersed with actual photos of Douglas with Polar, and the beautiful watercolor illustrations of Laurie McGaw. The epilogue is chock-full of historical facts and photos. This is an exciting read-aloud to hold the interest of young and old. It gives a timeless humanity to history, and Daisy's love for her only child will reach out through the pages.
GRADES FOUR-SIX
THE WORRY STONE by Marianna Dengler, illustrated by Sibyl Graber Gerig, Rising Moon, 1996, $14.95.
"The Worry Stone" is a delightful story connecting past, present and future generations of storytelling. An elder named Amanda goes to the park every day and spots young Jason sitting quietly by himself, left out of the games. She suspects he is lonely and could use company so she enchants him with her worry stone and stories.
The story Amanda tells Jason was one her grandfather told her when she was young and alone. It made her feel fortunate and special to have a worry stone and she is ready to pass down her story and her stone to Jason.
The beautiful light of the watercolor and pencil illustrations by Sibyl Graber Gerig reflect the wonderfully told tale of Marianna Dengler. The legend of the worry stone was originally passed down from the Chumash Indians who would be pleased that the tale of "The Worry Stone" is being kept alive.
YOUNG ADULTS
ANGELS OF THE SWAMP by Dorothy Raymond Whittaker, Walker and Co., New York, 1992, 209 pages, $18.
During the Great Depression, in the summer of 1932, three young people -- 15-year-old Taffy, an orphan, 12-year-old Jody, living with an alcoholic uncle, and 18-year-old Jeff, an unemployed city boy from Tampa -- find themselves seeking relief from unsatisfactory home lives by surviving on an island off the west coast of Florida.
The story starts as Taffy is poling a skiff to Crane's Bog, a familiar, safe haven until the snakes take to the water. There she meets Jody, in his own skiff, battling a badly infected knee. They pair up and pole to Pelican Island, 100 miles away, a place Jody remembers from shellfishing. Jeff enters their lives, finds a way to earn money and brings them closer together.
This book, one in the American History Series for Young People, is steeped in the flora and fauna of the swamps and islands of Florida. It is based largely on the author's experience as a child on Tampa Bay. In an author's note she tells of the livelihood of the fishermen during the Depression years. All through the story she weaves these details into an easily read, touching novel for young adults.

Searching for the origins of winespeak Jefferson may be to blame

Full text: The other day I was e-mailed a wine description: "The color of the wine was deep golden. It stood tall in the glass and had ripe tropical fruit flavors and an everlasting finish." All I'm getting here visually is a large overripe banana in a glass.
The American art of "winespeak" has evolved into a horrendous jumble of adjectives that lends about as much comfort as the pretentious people you see in the wine stores clutching their Robert Parker reviews and vintage charts as if they were growths on their bodies.
OK, so I, too, am guilty of using this annoying winespeak. I worked for almost 12 years in the wine business, so it was hard not to be immersed in it. I spent much of that time trying to erase this verbal facade from the memories of wait staff who are the messengers of their generation passing it down to the next. It was a daunting task. Throughout, the most commonly asked question was: Where did this wine language come from?
I have a theory. Wine and viticulture was introduced to the United States primarily by statesman Thomas Jefferson. His sojourns to France gave him a taste of their culture and their wine. Enamored of these, he introduced this magnificent culture to the U.S. Eighteenth-century European tableside service, wine descriptions (in French, soon to be translated into English) and wine making were suddenly being Americanized. So there it was -- French wine culture brought to the U.S.A. -- translated and frozen in time.
For the first century or more of its development, this terminology was appreciated only by the wealthy, because there was no good-quality wine being made in the United States back then. It was all being shipped from Europe. The average person could not afford it, so wine and the language that had evolved around it became the syntax of the wealthy and pretentious. Add another century or so of economic ups and downs, slow (but progressive) appreciation and understanding of good wine, and this is what we have become: a society of people who use wine descriptions they are uncomfortable with.
Additionally, we put a lot of our trust in a handful of popular self-proclaimed experts who rate fine wines the same way a high school paper is graded. Wine writers can be interesting, but maybe they smoked a great big stinky cigar right before they panned your favorite Cabernet. Or maybe a New York cabbie just flipped them off, and they're just generally having a really bad day.
The solution? Become your own wine guru. Learn what the descriptions mean. Develop your own syntax. Rate your own wines. Record or write down everything you taste.
I have prepared a starting point. Listed below are definitions and examples of some of the more commonly utilized descriptive terms for wine, both used and abused by society today.
Dry
Try to explain how a liquid can be dry to a room full of 20-something-year-olds. Here it is. Very simply, the wine term "dry" means lacking sweetness. No sugar -- maybe a fruit flavor -- but no sweetness whatsoever. If you want to try one of the driest wines made, try a Muscadet (mus-cah-day). Muscadet is a town in France's Loire Valley, which is noted for its seafood. Muscadet is the wine to be served with oysters. It is bone dry. Some notable brands are Ragotierre, Domaine de la Batardierre and Sauvion. All for under 10 bucks.
Fruity
How can you not feel like Julia Child saying this word? This is a really misunderstood term. I hate using it. Most people think fruity means sweet. What it really means in wine terms is tasting like a fresh fruit. If you pick a Macintosh apple off a tree and bite into it, you will taste the freshness of the apple, but very little sweetness. If you want to taste a wine that is "fruity" -- not sweet -- try a wine made from Chenin Blanc, like Dry Creek or Beringer, or a Riesling from Alsace like Trimbach. If you prefer red, try a Beaujolais-Villages from Duboeuf or Jadot.
Tannic
Most people have experienced this taste sensation whether they know it or not. If you have ever had an overly strong cup of tea or bitten into unsweetened chocolate, that taste is tannic acid. One wait-person described it to me as "fuzzy sweaters on my teeth."
Grapes that produce red wine have varying amounts of tannic acid. Over a period of years, the tannic acid will fade, giving the wine a much smoother taste. Some tannic acid will dissipate by letting red wine "breathe," to be open for a while. White wine has only trace amounts of tannin. You can't notice it at all in the taste.
If you want to experience tannic acid, buy a young (1994 or 1995) Cabernet Sauvignon from California. Try something in the $10 to $15 price range and you will taste the tannic acid. Most American-made Cabernets are released long before they are ready to drink. Being so young makes them somewhat hard and tannic. Try putting them away for a couple of years and see how they develop.
Oaky
When wine is vinified there are several courses it can take. It can be fermented in stainless steel tanks, filtered, then bottled. Or it can be fermented in oak barrels and-or sent to oak barrels after fermentation to age. Oak aging is the ancient French hand-crafted method of letting wine develop. Complex grape varieties such as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon benefit greatly from this process. The result is an oaky or woody flavor. The oak will sometimes lend a vanilla nuance to the flavor of the wine. A really good example of this that I have tried recently is the 1994 Bonterra Chardonnay from Mendocino made by Fetzer. It really has a nice (not offensive) oak flavor and is made from 100 percent organically grown grapes.
Earthy
A wine with an earthy -- or shall we say "barnyard"? -- aroma is not a bad thing. One of the most amusing things I ever witnessed was in a cellar in Burgundy where I was watching a bunch of very pleased French wine makers exclaiming that the wine smelled earthy. Actually they used a different adjective. Good Pinot Noir should have a nice earthy or organic aroma. Bad Pinot Noir smells like a pile of burning tires. If you would like to try a good "earthy" Pinot Noir, try Robert Mondavi's 1994 unfiltered -- about $17 -- it's excellent. If you prefer a more delicate style, try the David Bruce 1994 Russian River Reserve -- $25.
Restaurants, distributors or businesses sponsoring or hosting a wine tasting event or individuals with questions about wine can reach me by mail at Chris Plumstead, 446 North Road, Newburgh 04444, or by e-mail at theBDNvine@aol.com. Deadlines for late July-early August events is July 14.

Residents deed Glidden Midden to local land trust Historic shell deposit to be preserved

Full text: NEWCASTLE -- The Glidden Midden, a prehistoric pile of oyster shells on the banks of the Damariscotta River, has been deeded to a local land trust.
Left behind by ancient peoples and described as one of the most significant shell deposits of its kind in Maine, the Glidden Midden has been deeded to the Damariscotta River Association by George and Josephine Hart of Glidden Point.
"George and Jo have not only always opened their property for all who sought to visit this national treasure, but acted as dutiful stewards while maintaining the natural environment with which it is associated," Damariscotta River Association President Suzanne Johnson noted. "We, on behalf of the community, are most grateful for their faith in us and for the continuing opportunity to maximize protection of this unique resource for public benefit."
Known to a generation of field-tripping midcoast area students, professional and amateur anthropologists, the Glidden Midden is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the largest of its kind in New England, according to Peter Knauss, executive director of the river association.
Knauss said middens are the refuse of indigenous peoples or, more specifically, "piles of refuse that develop around habitation or exploration sites."
Middens are composed of high proportions of oyster shell, mixed in with other discarded cultural debris. Thousands of middens have been found along the coast, but none compare to the Glidden site. Shells there are piled more than 30 feet high for hundreds of feet along the river.
The 10-acre Glidden Midden is a part of a much larger DRA conservation easement contributed by the Harts in 1991 for protection of the upper river's natural and scenic environment.
The Harts have owned, cared for and shared with the public the natural beauty of the midden area since they purchased the riverfront site in 1955. Before that, the land was owned by the Glidden family of Boston, a noted shipbuilding family whose ancestors began spending summers in Maine in the 1750s.
Among the potential findings that are of particular interest to today's scientists, according to Maine Historic Preservation Commission archaeologist Dr. Arthur Spiess, are tiny bone fragments preserved from Maine's acidic soil by the alkaline nature of the shells.
Knauss said scientists believe rising sea levels and the confluence of salt and fresh water from the river provided perfect conditions for a major oyster population in the waters of Great Salt Bay. He said native populations feasted on the oysters for more than 1,500 years.
Because of the shells' fragility and problems with erosion, the midden must be protected, Knauss said, a point the DRA will continue to emphasize to visitors. The shell heaps cannot be disturbed in their natural condition in any way by the public.
Knass said a major excavation of the Whaleback Midden across the river from the Glidden site took place in 1887. Now owned by the Bureau of Parks and Lands, records and artifacts retrieved from that excavation yielded examples of pottery, stone and bone artifacts, wigwam floors, and fire hearths that provide a "superb record of native American life and the local ecological conditions which supported it." The same artifacts remain intact in the Glidden Midden.
Damariscotta's middens probably represent discards through several distinct eras of occupation over a period of about 1,500 years, beginning perhaps some 2,500 years ago. Their setting, size and composition have been the object of archaeological study and a visual wonder for generations of visitors. Today's technology, tied to geological, anthropological and related work by Spiess and other colleagues will help to yield new insight into the human history of Maine long before European settlement.
The middens appear as a bright white riverbank where the Damariscotta crosses Route 1. There is no access from the highway, but the middens can be observed by boat or by taking the 3-mile Salt Bay Heritage Trail, which can be reached from Mills Road.
As a nonprofit organization, the river association has a better opportunity than its former owners to obtain grant funds to preserve the midden. The Glidden Midden represents a critical focus for the other prehistoric and historic lands in the upper river, which soon will be included in a National Register of Historic Places District.
The Harts' contribution represents all aspects of DRA's mission of preservation and promotion of natural, cultural and historic heritages. DRA preservation ensures new education and scientific benefits through associated programs with area schools, tours, lectures and research.
Later this year, the DRA will have a brochure available with maps and explanations about the Damariscotta River's natural and historic resources, with particular emphasis on the upper river, its middens and opportunities to enjoy various sites.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Don't look for a motel room in the area for the weekend of July 31-Aug. 2. Virtually every room in the area has been booked for the 50th annual Maine Lobster Festival.
Chamber Director Gil Merriam said his organization is getting calls from the Augusta area for information on the festival, because they have been getting so many calls for rooms.
Festival officials are expecting record crowds, probably 70,000 for the three-day event, and will probably order 18,000 pounds of lobsters for the visitors, a modern record.
"The records are not perfect, but I believe that way back when they were selling four lobsters for one dollar, they sold 20,000 pounds," Merriam said. "People would come by and load up with lobsters for picnics."
The festival started in Camden 50 years ago, when you got all the lobster you could swallow for $1. The festival grew so popular that it was moved to Rockland, where there was much more room.
After a fallow period a few years ago when it was actually proposed that the festival be canceled, a new generation of volunteers surfaced and re-energized the annual event. Since that low point, the crowds have gotten bigger and the weather better every year. Last year, an estimated 65,000 visitors consumed 14,000 pounds of lobster.
Merriam has developed a successful mailing program to 375 newspapers across the country. "It's quite effective and quite cheap," he said. "We can always tell when a paper runs a story by the number of calls we get from a certain area. We get a bunch of calls from Indiana one day, then New Jersey a few days later and we know newspaper stories have run."
It is said every year, but this year will be the "biggest and best" festival ever, according to Merriam. The festival has contacted former sea goddesses around the country and at least half of the 50 beauty contest winners are expected to attend, Merriam said.
In "the most ambitious production ever done in Harbor Park," according to entertainment director Chuck Kruger, the festival will offer Motown legends the Temptations for the Saturday night headliner.
The smooth Temptations collected 43 top 10 singles, 14 No. 1 records and four Grammy awards. Led by original member Otis Williams, the group will perform hits including "My Girl," "The Way You Do The Things You Do," "Ain't Too Proud To Beg" and "Papa Was A Rolling Stone."
The musical group Beatlemania will present an evening of tribute to the Beatles from the early days through the Sgt. Pepper period. The group now performs in Florida at the British Pavilion at Epcot at Disney World. "They jumped at the chance to come to Maine for the Lobster Festival," Kruger said.
Kruger said the other acts will include a tribute to Buddy Holly, stand-up comedy, two traditional banjo bands, jazz in the eating tent, Rick Charette and the Bubblegum Band, a tribute to George Gershwin and the swing band Eight to the Bar.
A high-quality bronze commemorative festival coin will be designed by Blackinton Mint of Attleboro Falls, Mass., and sold at the event.
A special 50th anniversary tent will be a feature on the Mildred Merrill Park. Historic marching organizations will represent each of the five decades in the annual parade. The theme of this year's parade will be "Claws of red, memories of gold."
The festival will feature the Sea Goddess pageant and coronation, the Great International Crate Race, and the traditional displays at tents on the public landing.
The USS Klaring, a fast frigate built at Bath Iron Works, will visit the festival along with several Coast Guard vessels.
More than 100 vendors have signed up for the event. The festival will include a cooking contest and art show, waterfront demonstrations and activities, carnival rides, visits to the Navy and Coast Guard vessels and the traditional 10K road race.

Full text: SORRENTO -- Growing market demand for premium blue mussels across the nation has prompted Maine's leading mussel exporter -- Great Eastern Mussel Farms -- to cultivate the mollusk in a growing number of prime spots along the Maine coast instead of harvesting them in the wild.
"Chip" Davison, president of Great Eastern Mussel Farms in Tenants Harbor, said Wednesday night that only so many mussels can be harvested from the wild and that limit is being reached. He said cultivating the shellfish is the only way to meet demand for a tastier, meatier product sought by restaurants and supermarket chains across the United States.
Davison said Maine's mussel industry also faces tough competition from Canada's Prince Edward Island, where islanders are raising mussels on ropes suspended from floating rafts. The cultured mollusks command about double the price of those harvested in the wild.
"Aquaculture is really where the action is going to be in the future," Great Eastern's president predicted. "We feel we need to do more farming."
Davison was speaking to a dozen Sorrento and Sullivan residents who attended a public hearing held on Great Eastern's application for exclusive rights to cultivate mussels in a 14.3 acres of water northwest of Treasure Island in Flanders Bay. The Maine Department of Marine Resources held the hearing and DMR Commissioner Robin Alden must decide whether to approve the application by late summer.
Linked to the mainland by a small causeway lined with granite boulders, Treasure Island lies off the eastern shore of Waukeag Neck in Sorrento. The small island has two year-round households. Its population jumps to eight families in the summer.
For over a decade, John and Connie Dedham have lived year-round on Treasure Island. The couple enjoy kayaking, snorkeling, bird-watching and beachcombing. They note their island boasts a nesting pair of loons as well as otters, seals and other wildlife. Bald eagles feed in the area.
The Dedhams fear more dragging -- the method used to harvest the cultured mussels -- will further erode the heavily dragged area. They say local wormers and clam diggers complain fishing draggers have wiped out the flats on the island's northern side. They say eelgrass, rockweed and kelp beds have also been damaged.
"We feel it is a possibility dragging can create an imbalance in the marine life in our cove," Connie Dedham said. "What we saw in our cove looked like clear-cutting of a forest."
In the summer, the Dedhams say they are already awoken or can't sleep some nights due to the noise of the fishing draggers' diesel engines and hydraulic gear as they tow the bay.
"Sounds like someone driving a Caterpiller tractor out there," John Dedham said. "It's pretty annoying when you want to go to bed."
Of American Indian descent, the Dedhams are also concerned possible Indian artifacts might be destroyed by dragging in their cove. They noted the Watson archaeological site, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is farther up Flanders Bay.
Responding to the Dedhams, Davison said the mussels would be raised outside the intertidal zones where wormers and clammers dig. He added the mussel farm would not interfere with lobstering since there are only half a dozen lobster pots on the site's outer rim.
Great Eastern biologist Carter Newall said the mussel seeding would take at most six days per year and the harvesting 20 days every other year. During that period, he said. there might be two boats working at a time. He said the mussels would be offloaded in Winter Harbor.
As for the noise made by the draggers, Davison said he has no control over when the independent mussel draggers fish. As for his own captains, he said one's an early bird and the other isn't. He pledged to deal with any problems arising from his company's two boats.
Actually, Davison said, Great Eastern has been seeding mussels near Treasure Island for over a decade. He said the DMR permit would give his company exclusive rights to raise and harvest the mollusks in the area. He said the zone would be delineated by half a dozen buoys saying "sea farm."
Sorrento resident James West lobsters and drags for mussels year-round. He has fished from Portland to Eastport.
"I have never had any trouble with clammers or wormers because we don't fish where they fish," he said.
Winter Harbor mussel dragger Ray Timmons urged DMR official Laurice Churchill to recommend approval of Great Eastern's permit. He said wild mussel stocks are being depleted.
"If we don't start farming, we are going to be out of it sooner or later," he said.
Sorrento resident Sturgis Haskins asked what Great Eastern's future plans are for Flanders Bay.
Davison said Flanders Bay holds great potential for mussel farming and he hopes area fishermen will get interested and cultivate the mollusk.
"I would love to see some locals get involved with it," he said. "The only reason we have our two boats is nobody else would do it."
Davison said a group of Maine aquaculturists and other interested people are holding an informational meeting about mussel cultivation at 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 6, at the Ellsworth Public Library. He said the public is encouraged to attend.

Full text: ROCKPORT -- Lew Dietz, the Maine writer who brought the story of Andre the Seal to the world, has died at age 90.
Dietz, who co-wrote the popular "A Seal Called Andre" in 1975 with Andre's friend and caretaker, Harry Goodridge, died at Penobscot Bay Medical Center on Sunday after a short illness.
During a 60-year writing career, Dietz wrote more than 20 books and hundreds of magazine articles. But it was the heartwarming tale of Andre the Seal that earned Dietz a lasting reputation. "A Seal Called Andre" tells of an orphaned harbor seal rescued from the rocky coast by the late Rockport Harbor Master Harry Goodridge.
Goodridge raised Andre from a pup and taught him tricks that delighted thousands of locals and summer visitors during 15 years of daily performances from Andre's "stage" in Rockport Harbor.
Adapting to fame like a seal to water, the camera-loving Andre was a natural for publicity. Andre made headlines when he left Maine each fall to winter at the New England Aquarium in Boston and in the spring when he swam home to Rockport. Media tracked Andre's every move as he made his way up the coast.
When he died in July 1986, Andre was mourned worldwide. Just as a statue of Andre overlooking Rockport Harbor keeps his legend alive, Dietz's book also remains in print. The story of the orphan seal has been translated into Japanese and was made into a popular Hollywood movie.
Goodridge's daughter Carolyn said Dietz and her father were the best of friends long before they collaborated on the Andre book.
"They were old friends long before Andre came on the scene. They were hunting buddies," Goodridge said Tuesday. "As for the Andre part of it, Harry wasn't much of a writer and Lew was. That's why he came into the picture."
Goodridge described Dietz as "a wonderful guy. I was a very close friend of his right up to his death. He was 40 years older than me, but he had a wonderful, active mind. He was just a wonderful man."
Dietz also was known for another collaborative venture, 1977's "Night Train at Wiscasset Station," a text and photograph volume that is considered a Maine classic. Dietz's crisp prose descriptions, combined with the photographs of his friend, the legendary Rockland photographer Kosti Ruohomaa, have delighted readers for two decades.
Although known as a Maine writer, Dietz was born in Pittsburgh on May 22, 1906, and raised in Westfield, N.J. He studied journalism at New York University and briefly practiced his craft in Paris. He soon returned to New York where he found work in advertising.
By 1932, Dietz decided he had had enough of city life and struck off for Boothbay Harbor to begin a career as a free-lance writer. By the end of the 1930s, Dietz was penning stories for such major publications as the Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and American Magazine.
In Boothbay, Dietz married his first wife, Margaret Hawkey. The couple resettled in the Camden-Rockport area during World War II where Dietz played his part by signing aboard at the Camden Shipyard when the yard was pressed into action churning out wooden-hulled minesweepers.
Always an avid outdoorsman, Dietz began writing tales of the Maine woods for Field and Stream and other publications once the war ended. By the late 1940s, he created a series of boys books on the outdoor life of hunting, fishing, trapping and guiding, always with an emphasis on adventure and conservation.
In the early 1950s, Little, Brown and Co. published "Jeff White, Young Woodsman," the first of a five-volume series featuring a young adventurer. Dietz wrote a half-dozen other fiction books for Little, Brown and also wrote "The Allagash" for Holt, Rinehart and Winston's "Rivers of America" series.
As a founding contributor to Down East magazine, over the next three decades Dietz contributed scores of articles, primarily on outdoors subjects. His last contribution to Down East was a piece of fiction published in 1988. He also wrote for True, Yankee, Geo and Redbook. His work is included in several anthologies.
After his first marriage ended in divorce, Dietz married the painter Denny Winters in 1960. The couple established an informal artistic salon in the large white house overlooking Rockport Harbor where Dietz was to reside for more than half a century. Winters was one of the founders of Maine Coast Artists. Dietz was instrumental in obtaining Rockport's old firehouse for a gallery. The gallery continues in operation.
Dietz served six years on the Maine Commission on the Arts and Humanities. He was also chairman of the Rockport Conservation Commission and was instrumental in efforts to preserve the Oyster River Bog. As a Democrat, Dietz was a rarity in Republican Rockport, but he served for years on the party's county and state committees. He was a delegate at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, where he took a stand against the Vietnam War.
One of seven children, Dietz was preceded in death by five brothers and a sister. Winters died in 1985. A memorial service will be held for Dietz this summer.

Bacteria may fight caterpillar

Full text: PORTLAND -- Caterpillar-killing bacteria could provide Portland with a safer way of ridding its Casco Bay islands of the health problems the insects cause.
Testing will begin this spring on the bacteria, which could replace the controversial pesticide used to kill browntail moth caterpillars that have caused rashes and respiratory problems on the islands.
The discovery comes too late to stop the planned spraying of Dimilin on the islands next month, but state and federal researchers say the bacteria could be used to get rid of the caterpillars next spring.
Browntail moth caterpillars first appeared in Maine in 1989 and have become a particular problem on Portland's islands. Their tiny hairs become airborne and land on people, causing a severe, itchy rash that persists for days. The hairs also can cause breathing problems.
Despite the health hazards the caterpillars pose, many islanders, particularly on Peaks Island, have opposed use of Dimilin. The pesticide can harm lobsters and other shellfish, and its long-term effects on human health and the environment are unknown.
The new bacteria, however, are engineered to kill only a particular insect and pose no risk to humans, the environment, aquatic life or even other insects.
The browntail-killing bacteria were discovered this winter by Normand Dubois, a U.S. Forest Service microbiologist, and researchers at the Northeastern Center for Forest Health in Hamden, Conn. The bacterium is a combination of two strains of an established bacterial insecticide called Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
When a caterpillar eats it, the Bt mixes with certain cells on the caterpillar's stomach wall, seeps into its blood and kills it.
Biologists will begin testing the bacteria's effectiveness in late May, when the caterpillars are actively feeding on the foliage.
The testing probably will be done somewhere on Peaks Island, said Richard Bradbury, a Maine Forest Service entomologist who will conduct the tests with Dubois and Jeff Tarling, Portland's arborist.
The Bt will be applied from the ground, not sprayed from an airplane. The group must find the right mixture of the bacteria, because browntails are finicky and won't eat foliage if they suspect something is wrong, Dubois said.
"What we want to do is prove that it will work in nature as well as it works in the lab," he said. "That's why we have to go with the ground application this year."
The caterpillars emerge from their webs in early May, feed voraciously and grow to 1 1/2 inches long before becoming moths in the summer. Portland is preparing to spray Dimilin on Little Diamond Island, Cushing's Island and infested parts of Peaks Island. The aerial spraying is planned for the third week of May, weather permitting, Tarling said.
State law requires the city to have written permission from property owners before spraying. About half of Peaks Island property owners have indicated they would allow the spraying.
The growth of the browntail's population is slowing, but the caterpillars, which may be found on hardwood trees within three miles of the ocean from Cape Elizabeth to Port Clyde, show no signs of disappearing.

Abstract: The state's softshell clam landings have dropped by 72 percent in the last 15 years. Now biologists hope to use thumbnail-sized clams to create a sustainable fishery. Later this month, the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery will announce the names of towns in the midcoast, southwest and Down East parts of the state that will receive a million free seed clams. The clams will be used to seed dormant flats, and perhaps eventually increase productivity. Twelve applicants are vying for the project, from Wells in York County to Edmunds and South Trescott in Washington County. Midcoast communities include Wiscasset, Waldoboro, and the five-town shellfish coalition of Newcastle, Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, Edgecomb and Damariscotta.

Full text: WALPOLE -- The state's softshell clam landings have dropped by 72 percent in the last 15 years. Now biologists hope to use thumbnail-sized clams to create a sustainable fishery.
Later this month, the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery will announce the names of towns in the midcoast, southwest and Down East parts of the state that will receive a million free seed clams. The clams will be used to seed dormant flats, and perhaps eventually increase productivity.
Twelve applicants are vying for the project, from Wells in York County to Edmunds and South Trescott in Washington County. Midcoast communities include Wiscasset, Waldoboro, and the five-town shellfish coalition of Newcastle, Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, Edgecomb and Damariscotta.
Hatchery outreach coordinator Ken Vencile says the state's unstable clam supply has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars from the Maine economy. It also has contributed to the loss of some conventional clam markets, and prevented the expansion of new ones.
"We want to see if this is a viable way to sustain the fishery," said Brian Beal, shellfish biologist with the University of Maine at Machias, and the Beals Island Project. "We're looking at ways to help create a more sustainable fishery, rather than a boom-or-bust one."
Beal said the project had hoped to announce the selected areas this week, but investigators are still examining flats.
For now, the clams to be used in the project are growing in the tanks in the Darling Marine Center, waiting to be scattered across coastal mud flats.
In June, they will be covered with mesh fine enough to keep out birds and crabs. Within half an hour, they will settle into the mud, and three years later, they will have grown to their legal harvest size.
Winning towns must agree to enforce their clamming ordinances, involve area schools, and provide volunteers willing to make a three-year commitment to monitor water quality, assess the growth and survival of the clams in the plots and attend meetings to discuss the results.
The plots will be monitored monthly, but hatchery administrators are relying on local enforcement to keep people away from the closed areas. "We're hoping they will see the potential of this project and give it a chance to succeed," Vencile said.
Biologists will be watching to see if the numbers of wild seed clams increase in the project areas.
"We've noticed that when we put netting down it seems to attract wild clam settlers," said Vencile.

Abstract: Last summer, Tom Roberts brought his organically grown produce, herbs and flowers to Hathorn Park and set up a small farmers market. He had participated in the Orono market for years but was tired of traveling so far from his Pittsfield farm. "This was based on the response I got last summer from my customers and from several other farmers in the area," said Roberts this week. One of the complaints he often received was that his customers never knew which day he would be at the park and what his hours were. By organizing, said Roberts, and setting a schedule, his customers can be assured of a dependable market date or dates.

Full text: PITTSFIELD -- Last summer, Tom Roberts brought his organically grown produce, herbs and flowers to Hathorn Park and set up a small farmers market. He had participated in the Orono market for years but was tired of traveling so far from his Pittsfield farm.
The venture was so successful that over the winter Roberts recruited several other farmers and has organized the Pittsfield Farmers' Market, which they hope will debut in June.
"This was based on the response I got last summer from my customers and from several other farmers in the area," said Roberts this week. One of the complaints he often received was that his customers never knew which day he would be at the park and what his hours were. By organizing, said Roberts, and setting a schedule, his customers can be assured of a dependable market date or dates.
He already has commitments for this season from two farmers -- a producer of strawberries and cider from Thorndike and a cantaloupe farmer from Athens. "We are looking for different types of vendors that will give our shoppers the broadest variety," said Roberts. Local farmers, shellfish and fish vendors, bakers and craftspeople will be welcome at the organizational meeting next week.
A farmers market, said Roberts, is the perfect marriage of the rural and urban sectors of a community. "When you shop at a farmers market, you see who grew it. Part of the aura of the market is the direct connection with the farmer. We realize we are not just selling a product, we are selling our personality as well. It is a whole, package presentation."
Roberts became well-known last year for his creative vegetable displays, stacking crates filled with colorful vegetables and using baskets, flowers and herbs to soften the look. He is very much the picture of a farmer: cap perched on his head, long, graying beard, suspenders and boots.
"The response I got from folks was that I had good stuff and I knew how to display it," said Roberts. He feels that a citizens board would be invaluable in helping keep the market pure; that is, eliminating tailgate peddlers who buy their produce from other farmers or supermarkets and then resell it as their own.
"We don't want a flea market. This is a not a fire sale. Any type of product or craft should be juried, and it must be grown by the presenters themselves and be farm-related," said Roberts.
Roberts said an organizational meeting next week will begin the process, including setting up a board to help manage the market. "When you have competing vendors, there are naturally bound to be disputes. We need to have a body that doesn't involve just the farmers to arbitrate and set rules," said Roberts. "I'm looking for avid shoppers, who live in town, to become a liaison between the farmers, the town, set the rules, days of operation."
The meeting is set for 7 p.m. Wednesday, April 16, in the council chambers of the Pittsfield Municipal Building. Roberts encourages any local farmer or producer and interested residents to attend.

Abstract: Representatives of a Connecticut-based firm, PSD Group, visited Ellsworth, Lubec and Eastport Friday to inspect possible sites for a fish and shellfish processing plant. Lubec Community Development Director Chet Childs told the Board of Selectman Thursday night that he had been contacted by Maine and Co., a state-sponsored economic development group that works with the Office of Community Development. Childs said Friday the group seemed favorably disposed to the area. "Obviously noncommittal at this point, but they were impressed with the size of the area, the potential work force that could be drawn from Machias to Robbinston, and the fact that we have excellent water in Lubec," Childs said.

Full text: LUBEC -- Representatives of a Connecticut-based firm, PSD Group, visited Ellsworth, Lubec and Eastport Friday to inspect possible sites for a fish and shellfish processing plant.
Lubec Community Development Director Chet Childs told the Board of Selectman Thursday night that he had been contacted by Maine and Co., a state-sponsored economic development group that works with the Office of Community Development.
"Their job is to go out and find businesses and try to get them to relocate to Maine," Childs said.
Childs said PSD needed a 25- to 50-acre site, preferably on the water, to build its facility. He said the company predicted the plant would create more than 100 jobs the first year, as many at 300 jobs by the third year.
Childs said Friday the group seemed favorably disposed to the area. "Obviously noncommittal at this point, but they were impressed with the size of the area, the potential work force that could be drawn from Machias to Robbinston, and the fact that we have excellent water in Lubec," Childs said.
In Lubec, there is a large parcel on the bay on Pleasant Street, across from the sewer treatment plant near the downtown area. Although much of it is wetland, Childs said he had spoken to Department of Environmental Protection officials who told him it could be reclaimed. But the town would have to mitigate that change by creating wetlands in other areas.
"What they are looking for is suited by that property. They want to be close to a fishing community, they said within 15 miles of the water, but they want right on the water if they can get it," Childs said.
If the company locates in the Down East area, Childs said, it probably would want the benefit of an enterprise zone or a tax-increment financing package. The TIF program was created by the Legislature several years ago to attract new business and additional employment to an area.
Childs said the land to be inspected was assessed at $153,200. He said the property, including a portion owned by Boston University, was available for sale. He said he was uncertain why it had been valued at such a high price. "It's pretty much worthless land," he said.
After the meeting, Childs said the company apparently had looked at property farther south on the coast but was unable to locate an appropriate spot. "Apparently they were looking for more space than was available down there, so they are coming Down East," he said.

Lobster council wins praise Bills to extend, kill panel aired at Augusta hearing

Abstract: The philosophical question of whether the state should force lobstermen to pay for marketing got swamped Monday beneath a wave of warm feelings for the Maine Lobster Promotion Council. The Legislature's Marine Resources Committee held public hearings on two bills pertaining to the council, one to keep it alive for four more years and one to kill it. Although attendance at the hearing was hampered by bad weather, more than a dozen spoke in favor of the council, with only two against. The bill to abolish the council is sponsored by Rep. Jim Layton, R-Cherryfield. He told his fellow committee members the Legislature and the Department of Marine Resources "should not be in the business of assessing and collecting taxes for this. The industry itself should determine whether there is a need for this and create its own method of funding it. I'm not against a Lobster Promotion Council, but the promotion effort should come from the industry, as it is with potatoes, blueberries and sardines."

Full text: AUGUSTA -- The philosophical question of whether the state should force lobstermen to pay for marketing got swamped Monday beneath a wave of warm feelings for the Maine Lobster Promotion Council.
The Legislature's Marine Resources Committee held public hearings on two bills pertaining to the council, one to keep it alive for four more years and one to kill it. Although attendance at the hearing was hampered by bad weather, more than a dozen spoke in favor of the council, with only two against.
The council, created by the Legislature in 1991 to boost Maine's premier seafood product, has as its primary source of funding mandatory surcharges on state-issued licenses. The amount ranges from $25 to $75 per year for harvesters, depending upon the class of license, and $200 for dealers. The council's annual revenue from the surcharges has ranged from $245,000 to $310,000.
The bill to abolish the council is sponsored by Rep. Jim Layton, R-Cherryfield. He told his fellow committee members the Legislature and the Department of Marine Resources "should not be in the business of assessing and collecting taxes for this. The industry itself should determine whether there is a need for this and create its own method of funding it. I'm not against a Lobster Promotion Council, but the promotion effort should come from the industry, as it is with potatoes, blueberries and sardines."
The only other person to speak for abolishing the mandatory fees was lobsterman Craig Sprowl of Boothbay, who also said participation in a promotion effort should be voluntary.
Those coming out for the council and its funding mechanism included state officials, dealers and many harvesters who said they originally were opposed to the mandatory fee but had been won over by the council's work, especially in creating a stable market and in allaying consumer fears about the safety of eating shellfish.
"I was against the council at the start," said Harvey Crowley of Corea, president of the Downeast Lobstermen's Association. "I've been a fishermen for 50 years, I've seen the market glutted, I've seen prices so low I've had to tie my boat up. What I've seen since the council started is that for $25 a year, I'm able to go fishing."
Lobsterman Steven Robbins of Stonington said he was "amazed that there's even a bill out there to repeal this. We're getting a lot of bang for our buck. To do away with this would be a terrible mistake."
Robbins, as did several others, said the council has been particularly effective in responding to the adverse publicity about contamination in shellfish, such as the discovery of dioxin in tomalley, the Portland oil spill and red tide.
Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden said she "always has been skeptical of government marketing efforts, but this is a good example of what the consolidation of funds can accomplish. Their promotion, appearances at trade shows, consumer education, crisis management, responding to negative campaigns have all been very effective on a very small budget, and they've used this assessment to leverage hundreds of thousands in grants."
Jeff Kaelin, executive director of the Maine Sardine Council, said while his group is funded by voluntary contributions from packers, the nature of the lobster business makes the mandatory fee the only workable approach. "It's easy for us to tax ourselves -- there's only four companies packing sardines. In the lobster industry, you have hundreds, thousands, of independent operators. The surcharge is the only equitable way."
Judy Powell of the state Department of Agriculture also supported the mandatory fee.
Sue Barber, executive director of the lobster council, said stiff foreign competition and the somewhat stagnant American consumption of seafood makes the effort to expand into new markets a necessity.
While not taking credit for it, Barber noted that the dramatic increase in Maine lobster harvests since 1990, from 28 million pounds worth $59 million to nearly 40 million pounds worth $105 million last year, has been accompanied by a modest but appreciable increase in boat price, a development that seemingly defies the law of supply and demand.
"We've had this tremendous increase in production with no glut, no tie-ups," Barber said.
The Marine Resources Committee has several lobster bills on its agenda this session, including proposals on restricting entry into the fishery, an owner-operator requirement for licensure and a repeal of the trap tag law passed last session. Because the weather prevented many lobstermen from traveling to Augusta Monday, the committee will continue its hearings at a later date, probably next week.

Shellfish bill packs hearing Loss of municipal control at issue

Abstract: The bill, sponsored by Sen. Marge Kilkelley, D-Wiscasset, would abolish municipal shellfish ordinances and replace them with one state standard, a change supporters say would open the clam flats to all, and that opponents claim would destroy the local expertise and volunteerism that has the industry on the rebound. A veteran of 10 years in the House before moving over to the Senate this year, Kilkelley told the committee that friends and foes alike have said the bill "is probably the craziest thing I've ever done as a legislator," but she added inequalities in access to the resource makes it worth the fight. Since 1963, state law has required that towns make only 10 percent of the clam licenses they issue available to nonresidents of the town, at up to twice the price. While that may have been acceptable 34 years ago, Kilkelley said, the reality of today is that many who rely on income from shellfish harvesting can no longer afford to live on the coast.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- Early this legislative session, several members of the Marine Resources Committee predicted that a bill to wrest shellfish management from municipal control would be the hot item on their agenda.
Those seers proved to be accurate Thursday as more than 200 harvesters, town and state officials, fisheries scientists and legislators packed a public hearing to argue history, economics, logistics, logic and the always emotional issue of public access to natural resources.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Marge Kilkelley, D-Wiscasset, would abolish municipal shellfish ordinances and replace them with one state standard, a change supporters say would open the clam flats to all, and that opponents claim would destroy the local expertise and volunteerism that has the industry on the rebound.
A veteran of 10 years in the House before moving over to the Senate this year, Kilkelley told the committee that friends and foes alike have said the bill "is probably the craziest thing I've ever done as a legislator," but she added inequalities in access to the resource makes it worth the fight.
Since 1963, state law has required that towns make only 10 percent of the clam licenses they issue available to nonresidents of the town, at up to twice the price. While that may have been acceptable 34 years ago, Kilkelley said, the reality of today is that many who rely on income from shellfish harvesting can no longer afford to live on the coast.
Kilkelley said she decided to write the bill after talking to a constituent from inland Whitefield. "This is a man with two kids who told me he was lucky enough to get a nonresident license this year, but couldn't count on one for next year. If people are going to support their families, they need access to our resources. They need an opportunity to work and to earn a living."
With most of the state's shellfish powers already on record as being opposed to the change, Kilkelley, describing herself as "a very practical person," admitted it is unlikely the bill will make it out of committee. "Instead, I ask you to use this as a vehicle to look at the public policy issues involved, and to determine how the unintended negative consequences of the current law can be ameliorated."
In addition to asking the committee to consider increasing the nonresident license allotment and revising the price structure, Kilkelley said the law must be amended to ensure that licensing decisions made by a town are based upon science and not societal pressures. Kilkelley also asked for a review of the tight restriction some towns place on nonresident recreational licenses.
Several supporters said towns have become too territorial in enforcing their shellfish ordinances. They questioned how clams could be deemed the property of towns while all other natural resources, from lobster to white-tailed deer, are open to all.
"It's a darn shame to shut out people from Augusta, Waterville or Skowhegan," said Clark Jones of Wiscasset. "I can go up there to hunt deer, but they can't come to my town to dig a peck of clams for a picnic."
Lori Howell, vice president of Spinney Creek Shellfish Co., said that although some towns have managed the resource well, "the standards of municipal enforcement are not high enough. We could sell two to three times as many clams if we'd get beyond these territorial boundaries and get on with the business of increasing production."
While supporters ran out of speakers long before their one-hour time limit expired, opponents lined the length of the Augusta Civic Center auditorium waiting to get in their shots.
First up was Bob Cummings of the Phippsburg Shellfish Committee, who, as did many others to come, said clams are a different kettle of fish from other resources in that properly managing a flat takes an enormous amount of volunteer effort that only locals can provide.
"It's the people of these towns that have fought to clean up the flats and to restore this resource," Cummings said. "It's only the local people who have the political will to do what's right. It would take $100,000 of state money to do what Phippsburg volunteers do every year. History has shown again and again that that which everyone owns, no one protects."
Sen. Phillip Harriman of the Yarmouth-Brunswick region agreed that the local volunteers who clean up flats, monitor water quality, reseed and survey would disappear if the bill became law.
Jack Schneider of Georgetown said he was "totally perplexed" as to how anyone could consider jeopardizing the livelihoods of more than 1,800 commercial harvesters by taking responsibility for clam management from local volunteers and turning it over to "those bureaucrats in Augusta."
Speaking as an Augusta bureaucrat, Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden said she, too, was puzzled and opposed. "There is a long history, going back to Colonial times, of local management of this local resource," Alden said. "We rely on our partnership with towns -- shellfish demands intense management and hard work. It demands a sense of stewardship and responsibility that comes from these municipal ordinances, that creates this direct link between use and management."
Alden said local efforts to restore contaminated flats have led to the reopening of more than 21,000 acres of flats in the last two years and estimated the cost of replacing the volunteer work at more than $1 million.
University of Maine shellfish biologist Brian Beal called Kilkelley's bill "poorly thought-out and illogical" by assuming that the local volunteerism would continue under state control. "Instead of wasting our time defending local control and comparing clams to deer, we should be here today debating a nonexistent bill on enhancing managment of this resource," Beal said.
The committee, which had only a few questions for those testifying, will sort through the comments gathered during the hearing at a work session next Thursday.

Full text: You can still make reservations for the 12th annual "Evening With The Great Chefs" fund-raiser at 6 p.m. Monday at Jeff's Catering in Brewer. The event, including an auction, benefits the National Kidney Foundation of Maine.
NKF volunteer Jennifer Walton hopes all 350 tickets will go because of the outstanding auction items and fabulous foods donated for the benefit. For years, bronze sculpturist Forest Hart has contributed to the auction. This year, Walton said, it is "`Perky,' a little red fox with a value of $300."
KISS radio offers $800 worth of advertising. You could get a year's free paging from New England Page, restaurant certificates, furniture, or signal your choice for a variety of activities from theater to music events.
Walton, a kidney transplant recipient, is pleased that professional auctioneer and fellow recipient Ben Tilton of East Corinth will be at the microphone. Ben Tilton and Sons work the audience into a generous bidding mood. "He and his sons all participate, and it's really kind of neat," she said.
The event offers food prepared by students at Penobscot Job Corps Center and United Technology Center of Bangor. Representing the health field will be chefs from Eastern Maine Medical Center and Acadia Hospital.
Restaurants taking part are the Sea Dog, Jasmine's, the Olive Garden, Feta's, the Lemon Tree, Governor's, Geaghan's Roundhouse, the Brown Bag, Killarney's, The Mex, and Steve's Stagecoach.
Specialties prepared by chefs at the University of Maine Wells Commons will be served with favorite staples from the Brick Oven Bakery and The Bagel Shop. Wholesale food suppliers include Jordan's, Sisco, Carl Smith, Northcenter, Maine Shellfish, Grant's Dairy, Shop 'n Save, and Shaw's Hogan Road.
Call 942-1028 for tickets.
In the spirit of the season, the staff of Hope House, providing emergency shelter and services for people with substance abuse problems, sends thanks to those helping improve the lives of its guests.
Chris Olsen reports that Jack Quirk and Chevrolet-Geo recently donated a 1985 Subaru station wagon to provide transportation for Project Hope. The new program, coordinated by Jim Harney, enables homeless individuals and those in Hope House transitional housing become involved in community service projects such as food distribution by S.H.A.R.E. and Shalom Zone.
On Wednesday, The Bangor Noontime Lions Club awarded Hope House a $1,600 grant to purchase a new computer system for maintaining a donor record database, publishing a newsletter, printing educational materials and information for fund-raisers, and providing access to the Internet to help identify new funding sources.
In the same spirit, thanks come from Dennis Marble, executive director of the Greater Bangor Area Shelter, to those who have given time, talent and money to improve that Main Street facility.
"Our shelter has needed some renovations for quite awhile, especially regarding the downstairs offices area," Marble wrote. In the past several weeks, "terrific improvements" have been made to the facitilty, which lacked adequate staff office space, had only one area for private conversation and two phone lines for six staff members and 30 guests.
Community Health and Counseling Services, Bangor Area Visiting Nurses, Northeast Occupational Exchange, Wabanaki Mental Health Associates, and the Greater Bangor Area Crisis Stabilization Services often had staff helping guests only to be hampered by lack of telephone access.
Two new offices have been added plus a third phone line. Funding came in a $12,00 grant from Region III Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services, coordinated by Kerry Slack. Additional work will be funded with this grant.
But the value of the grant was far exceeded "due to the unselfish, volunteer efforts and donations" by members of the community, Marble wrote.
"The major work has been done by Robby Speirs and the other folks with Habitat for Humanity."
Greatly appreciated assistance also came from Ron Lunn and Portland Glass; Bob Kelly, House Revivers; Norm Taylor, Jeff Taylor and Mike Tompkins, Taylor Communications; Mark Martin, director of Home Builders Institute affiliated with Penobscot Job Corps Center; and Dan Kinney of Kinney Electric.
"Cindy Raymond, a young woman who lives near the shelter," Marble wrote, "took it upon herself to make a set of curtains so guests would have privacy when meeting in the director's office."
We can tell you, if your business or organization is remodeling or redecorating, to call GBAS at 947-0045 to find out if the shelter can use what you no longer need. GBAS appreciates any donations.
"All of this support is one more chapter in this community's history of helping our homeless," Marble wrote, "and we are sincerely and profoundly grateful.'

Abstract: Fans of Brownie [Mildred Brown] Schrumpf gathered Saturday afternoon at the University of Maine at Augusta to celebrate her induction into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame, and to sing the praises of the beloved 94-year-old cooking guru whose folksy food column appeared weekly in the Bangor Daily News for four decades. The Maine Women's Hall of Fame, established in 1990, is co-sponsored by the Maine Federation of Business and Professional Women and the University of Maine at Augusta. Past inductees include the late Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and Mabel Wadsworth of Bangor who helped establish the Maine Family Planning Association. Born in Readfield in 1903, Brownie graduated from the University of Maine with a degree in home economics. She was the assistant 4-H Club leader for Maine and the Penobscot County 4-H Club agent in the 1920s and '30s, and later taught home economics at the University of Maine, Orono, and cooking at the YWCA in Bangor.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- Fans of Brownie Schrumpf gathered Saturday afternoon at the University of Maine at Augusta to celebrate her induction into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame, and to sing the praises of the beloved 94-year-old cooking guru whose folksy food column appeared weekly in the Bangor Daily News for four decades.
Mildred Brown Schrumpf, affectionately known as Brownie, was unable to attend the ceremony due to illness. But a nephew, Roland LaVallee of Winthrop, accepted the certificate for her, and attorney Dana Devoe of Orono presented it to her Sunday at the Orono Nursing Home where she now lives.
Schrumpf was one of two Maine women inducted this year into the Hall of Fame based on her outstanding contribution to improving opportunities for all Maine women. Ethel {Billie} Wilson Gammon of Livermore Falls, founder of the Washburn-Norlands Living History Center, also was chosen for the honor.
The Maine Women's Hall of Fame, established in 1990, is co-sponsored by the Maine Federation of Business and Professional Women and the University of Maine at Augusta. Past inductees include the late Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and Mabel Wadsworth of Bangor who helped establish the Maine Family Planning Association.
Schrumpf and Gammon became the 11th and 12th members of the Hall of Fame.
On Saturday, friends, family and colleagues happily shared memories of Brownie, the diminutive cook, home economist, nutritionist, author and teacher who was never without a smile and a wise piece of culinary advice. Her cookbooks, "The Flavor of Maine" and "Memories from Brownie's Kitchen," became staples in kitchens everywhere.
Brownie's cooking and teaching prowesses, knowledge of food preparation, boundless energy and community spirit were recalled by Fred Hutchinson, president of the University of Maine; U.S. Rep. John Baldacci; Katherine Musgrave, UM professor of nutrition; and NEWS reporter Joni Averill, representing publisher Richard J. Warren who was not able to attend the ceremony.
Born in Readfield in 1903, Brownie graduated from the University of Maine with a degree in home economics. She was the assistant 4-H Club leader for Maine and the Penobscot County 4-H Club agent in the 1920s and '30s, and later taught home economics at the University of Maine, Orono, and cooking at the YWCA in Bangor.
Throughout the 1950s and '60s, Brownie was the Maine Food Products Promoter for the Maine Department of Agriculture. She also ran a series of food demonstrations on television and served as assistant executive director and acting director of the General Alumni Association of the University of Maine.
"Everywhere there was a need, there was Brownie," said Priscilla Dodge of Dixmont, a retired librarian who remembered Brownie cooking meal after meal for the families of those who were ill, visiting local nursing homes, shopping for groceries for senior citizens and chauffering them about.
Dodge said that Brownie would often say that "older people don't like to drive in bad weather."
"The funny thing is, these people were five or 10 years younger than Brownie herself," said Dodge, chuckling. "She just never seemed to age."
Dodge, a retired librarian, said that when she became aware that the Women's Hall of Fame Committee was looking for nominees, she immediately thought of Brownie. Dodge joined the NEWS and the University of Maine General Alumni Association in nominating Schrumpf for the Hall of Fame.
"If she's not in it, she should be," contended Dodge, who, as a child, would watch her mother cut Brownie's recipes out of the newspaper and refer to her with any cooking query.
"She represented Down East cooking at its best," Dodge recalled Saturday. "Whenever my mother had a problem with a recipe, there was Brownie on the other end of the phone."
UM President Frederick Hutchinson also retained fond memories of Brownie, who taught home economics to his wife, Dione. On their way home from school, his two daughters and other children in the Orono neighborhood would make a beeline for Brownie's kitchen where she'd heap homemade cookies upon them, he said.
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. John Baldacci said that Brownie also had been his father's home economics teacher at UM and that she instilled in him a love for good food and for cooking.
"He had so much respect for her," said Baldacci, whose father died several years ago. "She made a real impact on him. He would have wanted me to speak here today."
Katherine Musgrave, a professor of nutrition at UM, said Saturday that when she first moved to Maine from the South in the 1960s, she was unfamiliar with how to prepare shellfish and would often call Brownie late at night for culinary advice.
"I knew she would be up long after midnight," Musgrave said, chuckling. "She had boundless energy."
"Brownie exemplifed what we try so hard to teach in nutrition education -- that food must be good and the preparation simple," the professor added.
Musgrave said that in 1973 when the energy crisis precipitated an interest in canning foods, she counted on Brownie to always have "a ready answer."
"Brownie had more knowledge about canning, pickling and preserving than could be found in any extension or food book," she said."And the beauty of Brownie was that she never tried to teach anything that she hadn't done herself."
Meanwhile, Joni Averill of the NEWS said Brownie's columns were not so much about food, but about living.
"Her food columns weren't really about mixing ingredients properly to make a product, they were about mixing ingredients properly to make a life," Averill noted.
"If you read several of Brownie's columns, you discover at the outset you're not really reading at all. You are actually standing beside her, in her kitchen, and she is gently, firmly, lovingly, instructing you. She is not talking to you, she is guiding you through a process that is guaranteed to succeed if you follow her directions," Averill told the group.
Roland LaVallee happily recalled the homemade candies his aunt would continually bestow upon the family.
"The caramels were my favorite," he said.
Rick Warren, NEWS publisher, agreed that everyone coveted Brownie's famous confections.
"We all eagerly looked forward to holidays when Brownie would bring in samples of her holiday cooking to share with us. It was the lucky ones who first saw her coming through the door, because they often got all her soft, creamy caramels," he wrote in a statement which Averill presented at the celebration.
Meanwhile, LaVallee said Brownie would have been "flattered to pieces" to have received such accolades on Saturday. Still, everyone agreed that the lively little cook deemed pats on the back totally unnecessary.
"She'd have done everything exactly the same way without the recognition," said Hutchinson.

Full text: If fishermen in the Machias-Machiasport-Cutler and Milbridge-Harrington-Addison areas have yet to inform themselves about Cherryfield Foods' proposed cranberry project in Washington County, then perhaps it is time they did so. This project, if approved by the Department of Environmental Protection, will allow the company to convert 1,337 acres of natural wetlands and uplands in the drainages of the Machias and Pleasant rivers into artificial cranberry bogs, reservoirs and tailwater ponds. This affront to the environment is bad enough, destroying natural wetlands and drawing off large amounts of water from the aquifers during the driest times of the season to fill the reservoirs and flood the bogs.
Worse, however, are the additional pesticides that will find their way into our rivers and coastal waters. Aren't all the pesticides dumped on an additional 900 acres of cranberries? Supposedly, Cherryfield Foods' will have a system of tailwater ponds to hold the pesticide-contaminated water that is drained off the craberry bogs. Does anybody believe these will work? Does anybody believe the pesticides will not seep down into our groundwater, and that the tailwater ponds will not overflow and end up in our rivers?
What further harm will these additional pesticides cause to our already beleaguered fisheries? What will happen when the elver run coincides with an early spring application of pesticides and heavy rain causing flooding? What will happen to the aquatic microorganisms fed upon by shellfish? What will happen to lobsters that feed upon organisms killed by the pesticides? Can anyone at DEP answer these questions for us? Of course not, so why would the agency charged with protecting our environment permit this project? I urge concerned fishermen to call or write their legislators and Jeff Madore at the Department of Environmental Protection. Paul K. Donahue Bangor

Abstract: Sanitary district officials say they will fight a $50,000 fine levied by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Full text: WELLS -- Sanitary district officials say they will fight a $50,000 fine levied by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The federal agency says the district's treatment plant discharged too much chlorine into the ocean, which posed a risk to shellfish. The violations date back to 1993, according to the EPA.
Dennis Thayer, superintendent of the district, says that on several occasions the amount of chlorine exceeded federal levels, but he said it was "minuscule amounts ... less than in your drinking water."
"We're going to fight this," Thayer said. "The check isn't in the mail."
The district has three weeks to appeal the citation.
The treatment plant was one of six in New England cited by EPA for discharge violations.
State environmental authorities also have questioned the EPA's actions.
"There's really a question as to how bad this situation is," said Stuart Rose, a water-resources supervisor with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.

Safeguarding seafood FDA initiative aims to curb food-borne illnesses

Abstract: A nationwide initiative launched by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is designed to prevent future food-borne illness outbreaks. By the end of this year, an estimated 1,000 Maine residents employed by more than 300 seafood processing firms will learn to comply with new inspection guidelines. Contamination will be prevented through use of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point system, known as HACCP. First developed in reponse to NASA concerns about food-borne illness in astronauts, the system has been around for years as a voluntary program. What is new is the mandate that will require its implementation. About 30 volunteers in Maine have been trained as HACCP instructors. So far they have shared their knowledge with 220 participants in nine three-day training courses offered from Boothbay to Machias, in Burlington, Vt., and Portsmouth, N.H. A 10th course was wrapped up this week on Vinalhaven.

Full text: When players for the Providence College men's basketball team ate tainted salmon at a restaurant buffet in New York City early this month, it cost them the next day in a key Big East tournament matchup against Villanova.
Crippled by illness, the Friars lost their shot at the tournament title. No doubt the loss was painful, but it could have been worse for the disappointed players. Thousands of times every year, food poisoning is fatal.
A nationwide initiative launched by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is designed to prevent future food-borne illness outbreaks. By the end of this year, an estimated 1,000 Maine residents employed by more than 300 seafood processing firms will learn to comply with new inspection guidelines.

About 30 volunteers in Maine have been trained as HACCP instructors. So far they have shared their knowledge with 220 participants in nine three-day training courses offered from Boothbay to Machias, in Burlington, Vt., and Portsmouth, N.H. A 10th course was wrapped up this week on Vinalhaven.
Other sessions are scheduled this spring in Machias, Portland and Ellsworth, and training will likely continue through the end of the year.
"Part of it is just building up an information base, an understanding of bacteria, viruses and chemicals," said Mahmoud El-Begearmi, University of Maine Cooperative Extension nutrition and food safety specialist.
A professor of food science and human nutrition, he is part of the team working to provide the state with HACCP training. The Department of Marine Resources, the state Department of Agriculture and the National Marine Fisheries Service are other cooperating agencies.
Together they formed the Northern New England Seafood Alliance last year to ensure that affordable, effective training would be available to those who need it. The cost has been kept to $100 per person. Other providers are charging as much as $675 for the same training, according to alliance Vice Chairman Ron Hoelzer of the Brewer-based Maine Sardine Council.
While some seafood processors were skeptical at first about the need for HACCP, attitudes statewide are improving dramatically, he said. Many participants have been relieved to learn that better record keeping will be the biggest required change in their process.
Assistant Manager Bob Hessler was one of a half-dozen employees from Ellsworth's Maine Shellfish Co. trained in HACCP methods early this year. A distributor of fresh and frozen seafood, and a clam and shrimp processor, the business employs about 50 people.
"I think HACCP is requiring seafood companies to do what good seafood companies are already doing," Hessler said. "If you're not a good seafood company, you might have to make some big changes. If you are good, you have to document it -- prove it."
"On the first day, there's a tremendous amount of apprehension and animosity," Hoelzer said of the training sessions. "By the end of the second day there's a real positive attitude. The third day we hold a workshop for people to work on their own HACCP plans. The enthusiasm is sometimes overwhelming. It's inspiring."
Enthusiasm aside, experts seem to be divided on the likely impact of the HACCP system. A 1991 study by the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences, endorsed HACCP use but found little evidence that added controls at the processing level would reduce cases of illness. Money would be better spent inspecting fishing waters, according to the study group.
There were about 6,000 reported cases of seafood-borne illness from 1978 to 1987. Seafood caused just 3.6 percent of all food poisoning cases in that 10-year period, according to the 1991 report.
The greatest risk came with consumption of raw oysters, clams and mussels. Most related illnesses are mild and not reported. No amount of precaution in processing can entirely eliminate the risks of eating raw mollusks.
Hoelzer said a handful of deaths a few years back led to a "perceived problem" so severe the seafood industry finally asked the FDA to help ease public fears. The two groups worked together to mandate the HACCP program.
Under the old style of quality control, inspectors tested a small percentage of a finished product and assumed, if the sample was OK, that it represented everything else. The problem lay in the assumption, Hoelzer said.
HACCP works in reverse to examine steps in the process before problems occur, focusing on "critical points" where the hazard risks are highest.
For crab meat, one of those critical points is cooking, said El-Begearmi. Under the new program crab processors will track cooking temperatures and durations to ensure that contamination risk is minimized. A critical point in the production of other seafoods is storage temperature. Above 40 degrees, bacteria grow much faster, said the professor.
Charlie Tait of Cap Morrill's Fishmarket in Brewer said the firm began work on HACCP plans a year ago. Twice-daily temperature checks of freezers have already been implemented. He expects full HACCP adoption to be costly in terms of time and money, though he's not sure yet what changes will be needed.
Tait believes the effort will make seafood safer if followed exactly, but expects some smaller processors will go out of business because they can't afford to comply with the program.
The HACCP course teaches about types of processing hazards, how they produce illness, where they turn up and how to identify and prevent them. While every processing firm must produce a course graduate, it is not necessary to train every employee.
Those who are trained are responsible for conducting a hazard analysis of their workplace before the guidelines become law Dec. 18, and again every year or whenever the product or process is changed. Federal regulators will conduct on-site inspections to ensure compliance, said Willis Cobb of the FDA's Augusta office, seafood program manager for the New England district.
Tait is skeptical about enforcement of the regulations. He said government agencies like the FDA "are being given more to do all the time with smaller budgets."
"It's not going to be as effective as it could be because they're not going to have people to monitor it," he said. "They're just not going to have the budget to go out and do what they know they should be doing."
There's plenty they should be doing, he said, such as stopping some processors from using unethical tricks that include adding chemicals to scallops to boost their weight.
Cobb said Maine and Massachusetts have similar numbers of seafood firms, and are the Northeastern states most affected by the regulations. Alaska and Washington are other major producers of seafood.
El-Begearmi said that half the seafood consumed in the United States is processed overseas, and for the sake of fairness plants there will also be required to use the HACCP system in producing exports.
"Processors here will not be unduly pressured," he said.
Despite some initial resistance, the seafood industry is likely to benefit in the long run from the stricter safeguards.
"The whole idea is to make the seafood consumers go and buy at the supermarket or fish market wholesome, safe and free of any contamination that could cause injury," El-Begearmi said. "I think people will have more confidence in the industry."

Full text: AUGUSTA -- The State Planning Office's Maine Coastal Program has grants available for creation of boat pump-outs and sewage disposal systems covering 75 percent of the equipment and installation costs of a pump-out, up to $7,500.
The grants are designed for smaller systems and dump stations or to help meet costs of more expensive systems.
Sam Brody of the Maine Coastal Program said, "We strongly encourage people who own marinas or groups that manage boat access areas to apply for the grants while the funds are available. The grant process is very simple, flexible, and the turnaround time is quick."
Places with pump-out stations provide a service to boaters and help keep Maine waters clean. Raw or poorly treated sewage can spread disease, contaminate shellfish beds, and lower oxygen levels in water, affecting fish and other marine animals.
The federal government established a five-year grant program administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and in Maine by the Coastal Program. So far, 23 marinas have been awarded grants for pump-outs.
To apply for a grant or for more information, call Brody at 287-5649 or write to him at the Maine Coastal Program, Station 38, Augusta 04333.

Full text: CALAIS -- It should have been a simple charge of taking clams in a closed area, but the case took on greater significance when two clammers argued that Eastport's shellfish ordinance was keeping them from making a living for their families.
Thomas Cook, 36, and Robert Carter, 35, were in 4th District Court Tuesday to resist attempts to charge them with clamming in a closed area, and in a conservation area.
Although the men were found guilty of the violations and each fined $1,300, they vowed outside the courtroom to continue their battle against the Eastport ordinance. They said they wanted the state to regulate clamming.
Earlier this year, Sen. Marge Kilkelly, D-Wiscasset, sponsored a bill that would scrap town clam harvesting rules and replace them with a statewide standard and a single state clamming license.
Last year, the Eastport Marine Resources Committee, in an effort to protect Carrying Place Cove, and with the approval of the clammers, opened only 60 of the cove's 240 acres to shellfish harvesting. Orange-tipped stakes were installed to mark the open area. The cove is located off Route 190, near the Eastport scenic sign.
Cook said that when the original 60 acres was open, Will Hopkins, project coordinator for the Cobscook Bay Clam Restoration Project, who has been instrumental in developing a conservation plan, had assured them that there were 2,400 bushels of clams in the area. Cook said only 150 bushels were available for harvest.
In December, clammers dug in the closed area, and Cook and Carter later were summoned for the violation.
A group of clammers again met with the committee and asked that at least half of Carrying Place Cove be open to them. Although an additional 60 acres was opened in January, Cook and Carter said Tuesday the new area already had been dug dry.
The Eastport Shellfish Conservation Ordinance, which regulates clamming activities in the community, was approved in 1995.
Cook said he believes only the state should regulate clamming. "I want the state of Maine to take this over and get rid of idiots like Will Hopkins," he said.
Contacted Tuesday afternoon, Hopkins said he had no comment.
If the state regulated clamming, clam diggers could purchase a state license that would allow them to clam anywhere in the state, Cook said.
Carter and Cook said they would be unable to pay their fines. "I already told the judge I am not paying. I am surprised he didn't lug me off," Carter said.
The men said they would be back on the flats today, but they were uncertain which side of the conservation line they would be on.
"Somebody has got to listen. We have to get someone's attention because if we don't, clamming as we know it is going to be gone," Cook said.
Assistant District Attorney Paul Cavanaugh said that if the men did not agree with the city's ordinance, there were procedures to amend it.
"This ordinance includes many references on how to amend it. The city council presumably amends ordinances, and they {the clammers} need to make their political pitch. If they win -- it's amended, if they don't -- it stays the same," Cavanaugh said.

Abstract: Bruce Sidell, director of the University of Maine's newly founded School of Marine Sciences, used that example Tuesday to illustrate how scientific research can benefit industry. He was speaking to dozens of public and private sector leaders at a science, research and economic development forum sponsored by the Action Committee of 50. Founded two decades ago, the Action Committee of 50 comprises 150 members of the public and private sectors in the Greater Bangor area. The group's aim is to promote economic development in eastern Maine. This year's annual forum focused on Maine opportunities to create jobs and economic growth in marine-related industries. James Mullen, director of Acadia Hospital in Bangor and past chairman of the Maine Chamber & Business Alliance, noted marine-related scientific research in Maine has fostered $40 million in economic activity over the past five years. He said that research was conducted with less than $1 million in state funding.

Full text: BANGOR -- In the early 1960s, a Stanford graduate student on a research trip to Antarctica found fish swimming in frigid waters where their body fluids normally would freeze. He discovered the fish possessed an unknown class of biological molecules that prevent ice crystals from growing.
Over the years, biochemist Arthur DeDries' discovery has prompted businesses to explore the possibility of using the matter to prevent agricultural crops from freezing. The particles also have been considered for cold storage of hearts and other organs for transplant, and to eliminate the ice crystals that form in ice cream.
Bruce Sidell, director of the University of Maine's newly founded School of Marine Sciences, used that example Tuesday to illustrate how scientific research can benefit industry. He was speaking to dozens of public and private sector leaders at a science, research and economic development forum sponsored by the Action Committee of 50.
Founded two decades ago, the Action Committee of 50 comprises 150 members of the public and private sectors in the Greater Bangor area. The group's aim is to promote economic development in eastern Maine. This year's annual forum focused on Maine opportunities to create jobs and economic growth in marine-related industries.
The forum's panelists ranged widely, from Albert Carver of Carver Shellfish on Beals Island to Dr. Tom Long, director of the Center for Innovation for Biomedical Technology at the University of Maine.
James Mullen, director of Acadia Hospital in Bangor and past chairman of the Maine Chamber & Business Alliance, noted marine-related scientific research in Maine has fostered $40 million in economic activity over the past five years. He said that research was conducted with less than $1 million in state funding.
"That's $40 generated for every dollar put in by the state. I think the benefits of leveraging partnerships are very clear," Mullen said.
Last month, the Department of Economic & Community Development released a status report on the state's economic development strategy. The report says the state's Department of Marine Resources has set three goals to "put Maine on the map in cold-water marine science and business."
DMR Commissioner Robin Alden reiterated those goals at Tuesday's forum. She said her department aims to stabilize the number of jobs in Maine's traditional fisheries at 22,000 by 2001, and double those in aquaculture from 500 to 1,000.
Her agency also strives to make the state a world-class center for marine research as well as a marine biotechnology center.
Alden sees the involvement of Maine's 14 marine research institutions as key in achieving the DMR's goals. She noted only 75 of the 2,000 marine species in the Gulf of Maine now are harvested commercially. She said related marine research could help in the development and responsible harvesting of new seafood products.
"Marine science, in itself, is good business," she said.
Maine's aquaculture industry -- largely Atlantic salmon -- generates more revenue than any other fishery after lobster. Last year's harvest yielded $46.3 million worth of pen-raised fin fish.
Charleton Ames, chairman of Sea Run Holdings -- a Maine company raising steelhead trout and Atlantic salmon in Eastport -- said Maine's aquaculture industry has the fortune of being widely accepted by the general public unlike Washington state fish farmers who are seen as a threat by environmental groups.
Ames stressed, however, that Maine salmon farmers face tough competition from Chile, Norway and other countries. He said the state's science community has a role to play in developing and securing new marine-related industries.
"We need a marine science map of Maine to know where the marine institutions are and who can do what," he said. "We cannot survive on salmon alone. We need other species to grow."
UM's Long promoted biotechnology as a means to diversify and strengthen Maine fisheries. He is also chairman of the board of a South Carolina biotechnology company that uses marine microorganisms to produce the pink coloring that is injected into pen-raised salmon.
"I think the biggest opportunity and need is to have more effective management," he said. "Having more research is very important."
Joe McGonigle, director of the Maine Aquaculture Association, pointed out Maine's aquaculture industry generates the most revenue after lobster yet the United States is light-years behind the world's leading producers of pen-raised salmon.
"Our nation is a Third World country when it comes to aquaculture," he said. "I think it's because the money isn't there."
McGonigle said Maine's aquaculture industry is exploring other species such as cod, halibut and sea urchins, but the state needs to catch up with innovations just over the border in New Brunswick. He noted the Canadian salmon producer Connors Brothers Ltd., which produces the herring-based feed given to pen-raised salmon.
McGonigle warned that one formidable obstacle lies ahead in the expansion of Maine's salmon industry. He fears speculative environmental concerns about the interaction of wild and farmed species could hurt the industry.
"One of these ocean pens is going to tip or rip, and some of those fish are going to escape," he said. "Much of the concern {about genetic interaction} is speculative. Many of the wildlife scientists have been trained to ask what could happen. That is something that fundamentally has to change."

Renewing the Civilized Dinner Potpies harken back to a time when gentlemen would congregate for a filling meal at their clubs

Abstract: My feelings about eating are influenced by the season, the weather, my disposition and any other elements of the day. I want to feel good when I dine. In March, as the daylight lingers later in the afternoon and the blustery winds blow, what takes the chill off and makes me feel good are pot pies. The pot pie is a homey, functional dish that may evoke recollections of a calico-aproned grandma in a warm, cozy kitchen thriftily recreating yesterday's leftovers. But my associations with pot pies include gentlemen of the business world sitting at linened tables set with fine china, and chefs in tall white hats and checked pants, who, at the waiter's notice, slip an egg-washed pastry of goodness into a hot oven and pull out an aromatic, golden-crusted furl of flavor. [Charles] Fuller's recipe for Lobster and Oyster Pie -- individual pies for restaurants and clubs -- calls for "blanched oysters and lobster meat in equal quantities, a thick lobster sauce thinned with a little oyster liquor, individual pie dishes with the lobster and oysters, moistened with the sauce, strewn with chopped parsley, covered with puff paste, egg washed and backed -- a rattling good selling dish."

Full text: When once asked to define the meaning of regional cuisine, my simple reply was "what you feel like eating." Perplexed looks indicated that perhaps eating for those who posed the question -- as for many of us -- had become more a necessary function of life, not a moment of joy.
My feelings about eating are influenced by the season, the weather, my disposition and any other elements of the day. I want to feel good when I dine. In March, as the daylight lingers later in the afternoon and the blustery winds blow, what takes the chill off and makes me feel good are pot pies.
The pot pie is a homey, functional dish that may evoke recollections of a calico-aproned grandma in a warm, cozy kitchen thriftily recreating yesterday's leftovers. But my associations with pot pies include gentlemen of the business world sitting at linened tables set with fine china, and chefs in tall white hats and checked pants, who, at the waiter's notice, slip an egg-washed pastry of goodness into a hot oven and pull out an aromatic, golden-crusted furl of flavor.
In all the years I ran the Tarratine Club, my grandest feeling was when the daily luncheon specials I placed on the menu would sell out. Pot pies would every time.
Just recently I discovered a "Culinary Handbook" published in 1904 for the Chicago restaurant trade. Charles Fuller, the gourmand and author, detailed 15 recipes for savory pies, including beef, chicken, blackbird, pigeon, veal and oyster, and rabbit.
Fuller's recipe for Lobster and Oyster Pie -- individual pies for restaurants and clubs -- calls for "blanched oysters and lobster meat in equal quantities, a thick lobster sauce thinned with a little oyster liquor, individual pie dishes with the lobster and oysters, moistened with the sauce, strewn with chopped parsley, covered with puff paste, egg washed and backed -- a rattling good selling dish."
At the turn of the century, the growth of the railroads gave birth to America's fine restaurants. Produce and ingredients, once only available in certain regions of the country during specific seasons, became accessible to first-class culinary institutions. The beginning of the industrial revolution was a time of great prosperity, and Fuller urged his compatriots to "celebrate good times in a great land, land of grain, meat and vegetables, with food that cannot be surpassed anywhere."
In the kitchen of 1904, particularly the catering fraternity, the preparation of food was not taken lightly. Ranks of chefs and kitchen help would bone carcasses, make stock, wash and chop vegetables, and bake pastries. The laborious results of these properly run kitchens -- always by men -- would be food enjoyed both as nourishment and entertainment.
Gentlemen would congregate daily at their "club," not to grab a quick bite to eat, but to dine. They would check their hats and workday at the door, and enjoy the camaraderie of their fellow club members as well as a finely prepared hot meal. After rousing political discussions, perhaps even a hand or two of cards, they would return to their business, invigorated.
As the information-age revolution ushers in a new century, perhaps it's time to renew our culinary heritage and return to some civilized dining. With a little extra planning, and a collection of recipes and pastry dishes, we could check our hectic and fragmented lifestyles at the door, and enjoy our families and the luxury of a relaxing eating experience with a savory pot pie.
The individual components of Asparagus Pastry may be prepared a day or two early and stored in the refrigerator. When ready to dine, simply assemble the tart and bake. This is a delicious accompaniment to roast beef, or a delectable first course in an elegant meal.
Asparagus Pastry
For the crust: 2 cups flour 2/3 cup butter Salt 1 tablespoon sugar
Sift together flour, sugar and a good pinch of salt. With a pastry blender or in a food processor, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Add no water. Work into a ball, wrap and chill for an hour or more. Press into buttered 10-inch pie dish or tart pan with your fingers until you have a smooth crust of even thickness. Bake in preheated 375-degree F. oven until just brown, about 20 minutes.
For the filling: 2 pounds asparagus 1 1/2 cups rich Bechamel sauce 2 ounces grated Swiss or Gruyere cheese
Clean and peel the ends of the asparagus and cut into 1-inch pieces. Steam until tender (about 10-15 minutes, depending upon age of asparagus -- only testing will tell). Put the asparagus in the pie shell, pour the Bechamel sauce over it, sprinkle with cheese, and put into medium-hot oven -- 400 degrees F. -- until brown on top. Serve hot.
Bechamel sauce: 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons flour 2 shallots, minced 1 1/2 cups hot milk Peppercorns Thyme Bay leaf Salt Grated nutmeg
In a glass bowl in the microwave, heat the butter on medium setting until melted. Add the chopped shallots and cook on low heat for three minutes. Whisk in the flour, then whisk in the hot milk. Cook on medium-low and whisk until thickened. Add a few peppercorns, the bay leaf, nutmeg, salt and thyme. Cook on low for about five minutes. Strain through a sieve.
For Sunday dinner, I often roast a top-round or eye-of-the-round of beef that has marinated overnight in red wine and garlic. With the leftover meat and red-wine gravy from Sunday's dinner, I make Beef Pot Pies.
Beef Pot Pies
2 cups peeled and cubed potato 1 cup carrots 1 cup sliced celery
Cover vegetables with water and simmer with 2 bay leaves until vegetables are just tender.
1 cup frozen peas
1 cup sliced leeks, sauteed in 1 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup chopped, fresh parsley
2 cups rare roast beef, trimmed and cubed
2 cups gravy
1/2 batch Bakewell Cream biscuit dough or
2 sheets puff pastry (available in frozen section of
supermarket)
Drain vegetables and mix with leeks, peas, meat and gravy. Add 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley. Salt and pepper to taste. Spoon mixture into buttered casseroles. Cover with puff pastry or biscuit dough. Bake in preheated 375 degree F. oven until bubbly and crust is golden. Makes 8-10 pies.
When chicken is on sale at the supermarket, buy one to make the filling for Chicken Pot Pies. Individually wrapped fillings will keep in the freezer along with the puff pastry. They will make an elegant supper when you are pressed for time. Serve the pies with fresh broccoli and cheese sauce, or sliced tomato and lettuce salad with bottled French dressing.
Chicken Pot Pies
One 3-4 pound broiler 1/4 cup flour 4 cups chicken stock 1/3 cup cold water 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice 1 sheet puff pastry 3 bay leaves Salt and pepper to taste 1 egg white
Cook chicken with stock, lemon juice and bay leaves in large pot until thermometer registers 170 and the chicken is starting to fall off the bone. Remove chicken to platter to cool. Strain cooking liquid and chill. Pick meat from bones and cut into chunks. Remove fat from reserved stock and measure out four cups into saucepan and bring to a boil. Whisk 1/4 cup of flour in 1/3 cup cold water until smooth. Whisk into simmering stock and cook until thickened. Whisk in 2 tablespoons heavy cream, and add salt and pepper to taste. In a large bowl, combine chicken with gravy. Grease six 550s (Hall casserole dishes). Spoon in chicken and sauce. Top with puff pastry and brush the top with beaten egg white. Bake pies in preheated 375 degree F. oven until bubbly and crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Clamming takes a hit

Abstract: Brian Beal is right on target about Maine's clamming industry being under attack {BDN commentary, Feb. 15-16}. Clamming has taken a big hit over the last decade due to a natural down cycle in clams, overdigging, and clam flat closures, due partly to the federal government's one-size-fits-all standard for interstate shipping of all shellfish. Also, the understaffed, underfunded Department of Marine Resources' inability to keep up with the demand for water monitoring and shoreline surveys necessary to reopen clam flats.

Full text: Brian Beal is right on target about Maine's clamming industry being under attack {BDN commentary, Feb. 15-16}. Clamming has taken a big hit over the last decade due to a natural down cycle in clams, overdigging, and clam flat closures, due partly to the federal government's one-size-fits-all standard for interstate shipping of all shellfish. Also, the understaffed, underfunded Department of Marine Resources' inability to keep up with the demand for water monitoring and shoreline surveys necessary to reopen clam flats.
Recently, some positive changes have been occurring, particularly brought about by volunteers at the local level with DMR support. Sen. Marge Kilkelly's bill to do away with town laws would be a disaster for the industry. I believe in as much local control over our lives as we can get. The Kilkelly bill will end that for clamming. All the great efforts by volunteers up and down the coast to get flats open under local management plans will go down the tubes.
I've been digging for 40 years and I see this bill as a wakeup call for those of us who want to make a living clamming and are concerned about the future. I loved the freedom to dig where I wanted to in the good old days, before town laws, but those days are gone. Clammers have always been the most individualistic and disorganized in the Maine fisheries but now threats to the industry demand a change. Some good work is going on to create a clam advisory council and I'm hopeful that can help. But I feel strongly that we diggers need more than that; we need a statewide diggers association which can have some organization and unity. A strong voice that will be heard in Augusta. Peter Hope Thomaston

Full text: AUGUSTA -- The Maine Coastal Program needs volunteers for the Penobscot Bay Marine Program, which offers 20 residents of the region five weeks of training in marine and coastal topics.
In return, the volunteers perform 30 hours of work in community service projects in the Penobscot Bay region and meet each month for additional training. Training will be held Tuesdays and Thursdays, beginning in early May. Topics include marine ecology, coastal geology, fisheries science, shellfish management, maritime history, and water quality.
Courses are taught by naturalists, marine biologists, coastal geologists, fish and wildlife biologists, and historians. The type of community service project is left up to the individual to choose, but Atlantic salmon restoration, education programs at a fish hatchery and in school classrooms, watershed survey, water quality monitoring, coastal cleanup, and interpretive walks are all areas where service can be done.
For information, call Laura Taylor or Steve Cole at 287-3261.

Abstract: Maine clam diggers from Boothbay to Stonington urged lawmakers to reject a bill Tuesday they say would rob them of the right freely to market their day's harvest and give shellfish dealers control over their livelihoods. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Jill Goldthwait, I-Bar Harbor, would prohibit commercial shellfish license holders from selling directly to restaurants or other retail businesses. Harvesters would be allowed to sell only to certified seafood dealers or consumers. The latter would require a state Department of Agriculture permit. Brent Perkins, a clam digger representing shellfish councils in Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, Edgcomb, Newcastle and Damariscotta, dismissed the bill as a ploy by shellfish dealers to get control of the market. He said clam diggers rely on being able to sell to restaurants when shellfish dealers are not buying.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- Maine clam diggers from Boothbay to Stonington urged lawmakers to reject a bill Tuesday they say would rob them of the right freely to market their day's harvest and give shellfish dealers control over their livelihoods.
Supported by the Maine Department of Marine Resources, LD 409 is aimed at protecting consumers from tainted seafood.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Jill Goldthwait, I-Bar Harbor, would prohibit commercial shellfish license holders from selling directly to restaurants or other retail businesses. Harvesters would be allowed to sell only to certified seafood dealers or consumers. The latter would require a state Department of Agriculture permit.
Brent Perkins, a clam digger representing shellfish councils in Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, Edgcomb, Newcastle and Damariscotta, dismissed the bill as a ploy by shellfish dealers to get control of the market. He said clam diggers rely on being able to sell to restaurants when shellfish dealers are not buying.
"I have dug millions and millions of clams, bushels upon bushels ..." he said. "I don't see where the sanitation issue comes in. Don't let them pull the sanitation wool over your eyes."
"The dealers are going to take over the industry," Stonington clam digger Robert Ray charged. "The only people who are going to lose is everybody but the dealer."
"These dealers are trying to snow you. Use your own common sense," Ed Miller, a retired, longtime clam digger from Bremen, urged legislators.
DMR Commissioner Robin Alden spoke out in favor of the bill, explaining that Maine shellfish laws do not fully comply with the rules of a nationwide group, the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference, which sets standards for states shipping and receiving shellfish.
If Maine fails to comply, Alden said, Maine shellfish dealers could lose the right to ship out of state. She added that more stringent federal laws are also scheduled to take effect next year.
"If our program does not meet the standards set by the conference," she warned, "our entire ability to sell shellfish out of state could be jeopardized."
Maine shellfish dealers echoed the commissioner.
Lori Howell, vice president of Spinney Creek Shellfish in Eliot, said certified shellfish dealers are subject to and have gone to great expense to comply with current federal health and sanitary regulations.
Unless Maine tightens its shellfish regulations, Howell said, the state's shellfish dealers could lose their certification through the conference. She said that status entitles them to ship out of state and abroad.
Much of Maine's harvested clams and mussels are shipped out of state especially in the summer when demand and prices are high.
"If Maine loses its certification, that means you can't ship product out of state," Stephen Beathem, plant manager and clam buyer at Maine Shellfish Co. in Ellsworth, told legislators.
Losing those out-of-state markets, Beathem said, would have a devastating impact on Maine's economy.
"If Maine loses its certification, 50 percent of all clam harvesters will be out of work and the harvest diminished in value between 30 and 50 percent," he predicted.

Committee set to hear fisheries measures Territory extension among proposed bills

Abstract: At least one of three fisheries-related bills the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee will hear Tuesday is actually considered popular with Down East fishermen. The first, LD 276, is "An Act to Extend the Territorial Waters to 12 Miles for the Purpose of Marine Resource Protection and the Enforcement of Marine Resource Laws." Submitted by District 129 Rep. Paul Volenik of Brooklin, the bill expected to enjoy popular support addresses the problem of out-of-state fishermen sitting three miles off the Maine coast, taking female and off-sized lobsters that Maine fishermen must throw back due to the state's relatively restrictive conservation laws.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- At least one of three fisheries-related bills the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee will hear Tuesday is actually considered popular with Down East fishermen.
Public hearings on the bills will be held at 1 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 18, in Room 113 of the State Office Building in Augusta.
The first, LD 276, is "An Act to Extend the Territorial Waters to 12 Miles for the Purpose of Marine Resource Protection and the Enforcement of Marine Resource Laws."
Submitted by District 129 Rep. Paul Volenik of Brooklin, the bill expected to enjoy popular support addresses the problem of out-of-state fishermen sitting three miles off the Maine coast, taking female and off-sized lobsters that Maine fishermen must throw back due to the state's relatively restrictive conservation laws.
"That is a huge issue for fishermen and for us in that, although we can enforce our laws on Maine vessels outside three miles, we can't for other vessels," said state Sen. Jill Goldthwait, chairwoman of the Marine Resources Committee.
"This bill, frankly, is probably not going anywhere because of legal issues" involving the federal government, said Goldthwait. However, a draft proposal by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission may result in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts sharing joint control up to 30 miles offshore, she said.
A second hearing will focus on LD 409, "An Act Concerning Commercial Marine Fishing Licenses." Sponsored by the Department of Marine Resources, the bill would restrict commercial shellfish license holders to selling only to shellfish dealers or to actual consumers of the product. The idea is to ensure that tainted seafood can be traced back to a harvester for public safety's sake.
"It's probably a bill that dealers will love and harvesters will hate," said Goldthwait.
The third bill, LD 500, is "An Act to Protect Near-shore Groundfish Spawning Areas." The measure would identify spawning areas, and restrict fishing there. A similar bill failed last year when it was decided that more scientific information was needed for proper enforcement.
"In theory, protection of spawning areas is important to preserving fish stocks," said Goldthwait. A downside is that all fishermen could be restricted in such an area, regardless of whether they sought to harvest the spawning species.
The proposed bill also would affirm DMR Commissioner Robin Alden's authority to redesignate spawning areas as they fluctuate, a right Goldthwait said Alden already holds.
Stonington lobsterman Richard Parke said Sunday that such a law would be one more opportunity for Alden to "abuse her powers." Parke already has filed a lawsuit against Alden, protesting her decision in December to allow a seaweed cultivation operation amid traditional fishing grounds in the Bagaduce River near Castine.
Three public hearings on bills regarding fishing for elvers, or young eels, will be held at 2 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 20, in Room 113 of the State Office Building.
The first, LD 353, "An Act to Improve Management of the Elver Fishery," would prohibit the setting of fyke nets out of season and prohibit fishing the middle third of streams. Fyke nets are long bag nets kept open by hoops.
The second, LD 315, "An Act to Amend Laws Regarding Fees Charged in the Elver Fishery," would reduce fees to $50 per net.
The third, LD 528, "An Act Concerning Elver Fishing and Dip Nets," would limit fishing for young eels to that type of net.
Those unable to attend this week's hearings are asked to call or write committee members with their comments.

Abstract: University of Maine hockey teammates Scott Parmentier and Shawn Wansborough had their eyes glued to the menu at the McDonald's in the Bangor Mall recently. Parmentier began the University of Nebraska football team's diet last summer and Wansborough, Parmentier's roommate, decided to follow the diet two months ago. For example, it lists low-fat foods that are the best choice for protein (for example, 95 percent lean ground beef or turkey; white meat tuna fish in water; fat-free cheese; 95 percent lean encased meats; and skim milk); foods that are considered second choice for protein (85 percent lean ground beef or turkey; dark meat tuna in water; low-fat cheese; 85 percent lean reduced fat encased meats; and 2 percent milk) and those considered third choice for protein, which dieters are urged to restrict.

Full text: University of Maine hockey teammates Scott Parmentier and Shawn Wansborough had their eyes glued to the menu at the McDonald's in the Bangor Mall recently.
It wasn't that they needed to be reminded of the choices. They probably know the menu by heart.
What they were doing was trying to convince each other to enter the Cocoon of Calories; the Lair of Lard; the Farm of Fat.
Parmentier began the University of Nebraska football team's diet last summer and Wansborough, Parmentier's roommate, decided to follow the diet two months ago.
"It seemed everything Scott ate was a minimum of 99 percent fat-free. I felt guilty because I wasn't watching what I ate," said Wansborough. "Plus, the way he's been scoring this season, I figured it couldn't hurt."
Parmentier scored 19 goals through Maine's first 29 games to lead the team in that category. Parmentier had played in just 24 of the 29 games due to injury.
Getting back to McDonald's, Wansborough said the two of them gazed at the menu for 15 minutes.
"I'd say, `I'll get an Arch Deluxe if you do,"' said Wansborough.
Some friends from school eventually joined them.
"They were laughing at us," said Parmentier.
Despite the temptation, Parmentier and Wansborough, both juniors, eventually walked away without placing an order.
The Nebraska football diet is flexible and involves listing preferred foods for each nutritional requirement.
For example, it lists low-fat foods that are the best choice for protein (for example, 95 percent lean ground beef or turkey; white meat tuna fish in water; fat-free cheese; 95 percent lean encased meats; and skim milk); foods that are considered second choice for protein (85 percent lean ground beef or turkey; dark meat tuna in water; low-fat cheese; 85 percent lean reduced fat encased meats; and 2 percent milk) and those considered third choice for protein, which dieters are urged to restrict.
The third choice protein list would call for 75 percent lean ground beef, fried fish or seafood, regular cheese and whole milk.
The same type of listing is done for carbohydrates. There is a list of foods that provide good sources of vitamin E (almonds, salmon, sardines, mackerel, trout, clams, oysters and scallops); vitamins A and C (tomatoes, dark salad, grapefruit, winter squash); vitamin C (oranges, pineapple, raisins); and vitamin A (green peas, leaf lettuce, peaches, skim milk, yogurt).
Parmentier points out that the diet doesn't work by itself -- it must be used in conjunction with an ambitious exercise regimen.
"You can't have one without the other," said Parmentier, who works out religiously, as does Wansborough.
They adhere to Maine assistant coach Grant Standbrook's training program.
They both admit that junk food had been a staple of their diets.
"I used to love Burger King. I still do," said Parmentier. "I used to eat there all the time."
"And we also spent a lot of time at McDonald's for a while there," acknowledged Wansborough.
Nowadays, a typical Parmentier menu consists of three or four bowls of Special K cereal in skim milk for breakfast along with V8 juice and a fat-free grilled cheese sandwich; a lunch of four tuna and mustard sandwiches on Italian bread with V8 juice; and a dinner of rice covered with fat-free spaghetti sauce and fat-free cheese.
Another day, the dinner could consist of fat-free hot dogs.
A Wansborough breakfast will include Total Raisin Bran, scrambled Egg Beaters and English muffins; his lunch could very well be boneless chicken breasts and a bowl of cereal; and his dinner could be homemade pizza with fat-free cheese and low-fat sauce. A protein shake may accompany dinner.
He figures he eats 8 ounces of chicken a day.
"Scott eats a lot of tuna fish," said Wansborough. "I wish I liked it. It's so cheap. But I hate it."
Wansborough supplements his diet with a lot of low-fat or fat-free yogurt. He also enjoys frozen yogurt.
They try to limit their fat intake to 60 grams per day.
The players admit they stray from their diets on the weekends, when they often have back-to-back games and need extra nutrition.
"On Thursday night, before a Friday game, we load up on anything," said Wansborough. "We try to get a lot of calories in us."
Pasta is a popular choice.
Both players have lost considerable weight and feel it has improved their performances.
"I went from being in the worst shape of my life last May to the best shape of my life now," said Parmentier, who has dropped 20 pounds and has already eclipsed his previous single-season high for goals by five.
Parmentier obtained a copy of the Nebraska football diet when he played for the Omaha Lancers in the United States Junior Hockey League before coming to Maine. He got it from University of Nebraska football booster Irv Dana.
Wansborough, who is Maine's second leading point-getter behind Steve Kariya, has gone from 200 pounds at the start of dry land training camp in September to 182 pounds now.
"I feel quicker. I don't know if I am. I feel better on the ice," said Wansborough.
"It has made a huge difference," said Parmentier. "I never feel tired anymore. I have a lot of energy and I feel stronger."
"They have decreased their body fat," said Maine hockey trainer Paul Culina. "They are able to work harder now due to the fuels their bodies have received. They are stronger and they have more endurance."
And they also have enough self-discipline to simply stare at the McDonald's menu instead of placing an order.

Maine's clamming industry under attack

Abstract: For some reason, every few years Maine's clamming industry has to endure political attacks that, if successful, would completely eliminate local control of town-sponsored shellfish management ordinances in favor of a state-run syste. To date, thankfully, these incursions have failed. This year, the battle lines in Augusta are being drawn for an eventual fight over yet another legislative bill to reduce to shreds the already fragile fabric of Maine's clamming industry. The threat this time is being sponsored by Sen. Marge Kilkelly of Wiscasset who has indicated that residents of inland communities are essentially being shut out from making a living from clamming. Those coastal communities without management plans such as Milbridge, Gouldsboro, Lamoine, Castine, Deer Isle, Stonington, North Haven, Rockland, Portland, etc. have chosen to exercise no local control over their clamming resource. Anyone holding a state clamming license may harvest clams in these communities providing the areas are not contaminated with fecal coliforms. There is an economic incentive for a community to manage its clamming resource, however. In 1985, University of Maine resource economist, Ralph Townsend, examined the effect of restricting licenses on the economic welfare of harvesters. He concluded that yield per unit of effort was 15 percent higher in communities that managed their resource than in those that did not.

Full text: For some reason, every few years Maine's clamming industry has to endure political attacks that, if successful, would completely eliminate local control of town-sponsored shellfish management ordinances in favor of a state-run syste. To date, thankfully, these incursions have failed. This year, the battle lines in Augusta are being drawn for an eventual fight over yet another legislative bill to reduce to shreds the already fragile fabric of Maine's clamming industry. The threat this time is being sponsored by Sen. Marge Kilkelly of Wiscasset who has indicated that residents of inland communities are essentially being shut out from making a living from clamming.
Sen. Kilkelly's bill ignores history and, more importantly, the resource. Since 1963, coastal communities with clamming habitat have had the option of managing their clamming resource. Today, approximately half of the 100 coastal towns have engineered their own management plan (shellfish ordinance) which is closely scrutinized by Maine's Department of Marine Resources (DMR).
Those coastal communities without management plans such as Milbridge, Gouldsboro, Lamoine, Castine, Deer Isle, Stonington, North Haven, Rockland, Portland, etc. have chosen to exercise no local control over their clamming resource. Anyone holding a state clamming license may harvest clams in these communities providing the areas are not contaminated with fecal coliforms. There is an economic incentive for a community to manage its clamming resource, however. In 1985, University of Maine resource economist, Ralph Townsend, examined the effect of restricting licenses on the economic welfare of harvesters. He concluded that yield per unit of effort was 15 percent higher in communities that managed their resource than in those that did not.
Today, Maine's clamming industry is struggling because of a downturn in clam flat productivity. In the decade between 1985 and 1995, statewide landings declined 56 percent from 283,000 bushels harvested to 124,000. Over that same time, state clam licenses dropped 60 percent from 4,141 to 1,668. The decline in landings has not occurred evenly across the state, however. Since 1985, landings have dropped by 75 percent in Washington County and by 84 percent in Hancock County. Historically, these two counties accounted for 45 percent to 65 percent of all clams harvested in Maine. Today, less than 30 percent of all clams landed in Maine come from these two eastern counties. The loss of jobs in the clamming industry is not for want of harvesters, but from lack of resource. No one can provide an unambiguous answer as to why production has fallen so dramatically, however.
Although production levels today are low, the silver lining is that the industry and groups that support clamming in Maine have stepped up to the plate like at no other time in history to counteract these declines. A few examples of the kinds of activities that have begun to invigorate the clamming industry serve to highlight these efforts.
The Maine Cooperative Extension and the Maine State Planning Office have teamed up to provided technical assistance and funds to teach local volunteer groups about monitoring water quality and conducting shoreline surveys in an effort to assist DMR with sampling that has led to the opening of thousands of acres of clam flats across the state.
The Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment recently announced its visionary of the year award which went to Sherman Hoyt, coordinator for the Georges River Clam Fishery Restoration Project, for efforts to pull together five communities along that river to form a Georges River Shellfish Management Committee.
Hundreds of acres of flats closed for more than 30 years in Eastport were recently opened thanks to the effort of another visionary, Will Hopkins, who, together with clammers from nine communities surrounding Cobscook Bay have formed a clam restoration project there.
The industry sponsored a statewide clam meeting during the Fisherman's Forum last year and this year for the purpose of bringing together groups from around the state to meet and discuss management issues and strategies.
This spring, the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery will initiate a three-year, large-scale, clam culture program in three communities along the coast to demonstrate methods that will hopefully result in a sustainable fishery.
The Kilkelly bill assumes that these and the myriad of other similar efforts will continue and that people will be as interested in shellfish management and water quality issues after local control is lost. Nothing could be further from the truth. Volunteers, shellfish harvesters, shellfish committees, and local elected officials work hard to manage the resource and improve water quality today because they know there will be direct dividends for themselves and their neighbors. Once local control is extinguished, there will be no incentive to undertake these management activities.
Also, the bill assumes an unrealistic level of oversight for a statewide management program. Currently, only three DMR biologists work the entire coast to assist municipalities with shellfish management issues. Their job already requires an excessive amount of field, laboratory, and desk work, so, how could DMR manage all the clam flats in the state effectively when there is insufficient manpower to assist fully the 50 or so communities engaged in management efforts today?
The Kilkelly bill would be an economic catastrophe. It would significantly hamper or possibly eliminate the unbelievable efforts of Maine citizens to rebuild the clamming industry to production levels seen previously in the 1970s and early 1980s.

Abstract: Two Passamaquoddy men charged last year with violation of Maine's saltwater fishing laws were arraigned in 4th District Court Tuesday but refused to enter pleas, claiming Maine law does not apply to them because it violates the tribe's sovereign aboriginal rights. Allie Beal, 37, of Perry was charged last year with taking sea urchins during a closed period and taking clams from a closed area in violation of Eastport's Municipal Shellfish Ordinance. In January he was charged with digging and taking clams in a closed area, again in violation of the Eastport ordinance. "They declined to enter pleas, challenging the jurisdiction of the court," Assistant District Attorney Paul Cavanaugh said Tuesday at his office. Cavanaugh said that following the rules of court, not guilty pleas were entered for the two men.

Full text: CALAIS -- Two Passamaquoddy men charged last year with violation of Maine's saltwater fishing laws were arraigned in 4th District Court Tuesday but refused to enter pleas, claiming Maine law does not apply to them because it violates the tribe's sovereign aboriginal rights.
Allie Beal, 37, of Perry was charged last year with taking sea urchins during a closed period and taking clams from a closed area in violation of Eastport's Municipal Shellfish Ordinance. In January he was charged with digging and taking clams in a closed area, again in violation of the Eastport ordinance.
Also arraigned Monday was Donell Dana, 40, of Perry who in November was charged with taking scallops without a scallop boat license.
"They declined to enter pleas, challenging the jurisdiction of the court," Assistant District Attorney Paul Cavanaugh said Tuesday at his office. Cavanaugh said that following the rules of court, not guilty pleas were entered for the two men.
Attorney Norman Toffolon of Machias represented the two men, but documents filed with the court asked that attorney Bruce Clark of Robinsonville, New Brunswick, an expert on sovereignty issues, be granted permission to also represent the pair.
The attorneys for Beal and Dana filed a motion to dismiss and a 54-page document titled "Confederate Native Court" in which they claim that "newcomer" courts -- all state and federal courts including the U.S. and Canadian supreme courts -- do not have jurisdiction over the legal issues involved.
The papers claimed that only the traditional Passamaquoddy court, "not to be confused with the modern Passamaquoddy Court," has jurisdiction.
"Upon taking judicial notice of the suppression and genocide of the native people caused by the prematurely assumed jurisdiction of the newcomer courts ..." this native court declares:
Jurisdiction rests with the native courts.
Should newcomer courts take exception with the rights of a native court, a third party court should adjudicate the matter.
Newcomer courts or their governments are welcome to submit evidence, law or argument to the native court.
Last year, Beal challenged the court's jurisdiction over his right to drag for sea urchins in waters off Eastport.
At that time, 4th District Court Judge John Romei agreed to delay Beal's arraignment until February to allow the tribe and state to continue negotiations over what the tribe claims is its aboriginal right to unrestricted fishing in "traditional territorial seas," including waters from Point Lepreau, New Brunswick, to Castine.
Last year, Sample argued for the delay.
Sample said when the tribe signed the Maine Indian Claims Settlement in 1980, it did not relinquish its aboriginal fishing rights.
Cavanaugh said the state had the right to respond to the 54-page document filed on behalf of the defendants and that a tentative court date on the issue had been set for March 11.
One issue the court will have to decide, Cavanaugh said, is whether Canadian attorney Clark will be allowed to represent the tribal members. "It is unusual, but not unheard of to have out-of-state council for important criminal defendants. ... It is up to either Mr. Toffolon or Dr. Clark to demonstrate to the court under our rules that we should recognize another nation's bar registry," he said.
The assistant district attorney said he thought Clark had been invited to represent the two men because he is well-versed in sovereignty issues.
"Dr. Clark brought enlightening information to our cause," tribal legislative Rep. Fred Moore said from his office in Augusta Tuesday night.
Moore said negotiations with the state have been "on again, off again."

Signs of population crisis seen in Canadian lobster industry Fishermen taking too many, leaving too few, says oceanographer

Abstract: FREDERICTON, New Brunswick -- Consumer appetite and commercial greed may be creating a crisis in Canada's East Coast lobster fishery. The loudest warning is coming from New Brunswick, where lobster fishermen have reported a steady and significant decline in their catches after record hauls in the early 1990s. Fisheries Minister Bernard Theriault of New Brunswick has asked Ottawa to act on conservation measures recommended in 1995 by the federal Fisheries Resource Conservation Council.

Full text: FREDERICTON, New Brunswick -- Consumer appetite and commercial greed may be creating a crisis in Canada's East Coast lobster fishery.
There are unsettling signs the population of the upscale crustacean may be going the way of the homely cod.
And conservationists in Atlantic Canada worry that bickering between fishermen's organizations and foot-dragging by Ottawa could spell disaster.
The loudest warning is coming from New Brunswick, where lobster fishermen have reported a steady and significant decline in their catches after record hauls in the early 1990s.
Fisheries Minister Bernard Theriault of New Brunswick has asked Ottawa to act on conservation measures recommended in 1995 by the federal Fisheries Resource Conservation Council.
"We do not have time to waste," says Theriault.
The problem is simple: with the collapse of the East Coast groundfishery, much more effort has been focused on the Atlantic lobster, which is prized the world over as one of the great gastronomic treats.
There are about 10,000 full-time licensed lobster fishermen in Atlantic Canada. There are also numerous poachers -- a factor that can't be overlooked in trying to assess the state of the shellfish.
Jean-Claude Brethes, a University of Quebec oceanographer who helped write the 1995 council report, summed up the situation in simple terms.
"We are taking too much and leaving too little," Brethes said from his office in Rimouski, Quebec.
"The exploitation rate is very, very high -- sometimes as much as 80 to 85 percent. It's very high and egg production is very low."
Technology has also increased pressure on lobster populations, says Michael Belliveau of the Maritime Fishermen's Union in Shediac, New Brunswick -- the self-proclaimed capital of the lobster-fishing world.
The crustaceans used to be able to scurry to deeper waters when inshore fishermen came calling. But picturesque wooden traps have been replaced by metal models and today's fishermen come with electronic, lobster-detecting devices.
"There's less refuge for the lobsters when you can go farther out to fish and you can fish a lot faster and much more efficiently," said Belliveau.
Nobody is predicting disaster at this point, said Belliveau.
Fishermen throughout the region realize resources are under pressure. Belliveau said there is general agreement steps must be taken to protect the lobster.
Some fishery groups in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have voted in favor of increasing minimum catch sizes for lobsters. The idea is to give smaller, younger ones a chance to reproduce at least once before going into the pot.
But there's a big market in Europe for the smaller lobsters, and Prince Edward Island fishermen oppose the idea of restricting their catches to larger lobsters.
Many lobster fishermen point out that the crustacean, like the snow crab, is a cyclical creature and say there is no need to panic when the cycle is on the downswing.
"There's almost an ideological rigidity to it in the sense that P.E.I. fishermen are dead set against size increases, whereas our New Brunswick fishermen tend to favor them," said Belliveau.
"So we believe we're on the side of conservation and the Islanders aren't. There are a lot of different reasons for that. You won't find a fisherman now openly against conservation, but they have different views as to how that can be achieved."
Lack of consensus is the main reason for asking Ottawa to move in and impose conservation.
"If the lobster fishery ever disappeared in the Maritimes, hundreds of communities would be devastated," said David Coon of the New Brunswick Conservation Council.
"Given the incredible importance of the fishery, the federal Department of Fisheries is going to have to take a strong role here. They're going to have come down on the side of conservation and make the necessary decisions."
Jacques Robichaud, a federal fisheries spokesman in Ottawa, said consultation is continuing with lobster fishers in hopes of achieving agreement on conservation strategies.

Abstract: Here, my youngest offspring, Hope - so named because my wife and I hoped she was the last of the lot - comes to mind. Not long after she'd had her fill of Pablum, Hope became especially fond of black duck. So much so that when she saw ducks flying over the river, which flows behind our house, she would come running to tell me. Come to think of it, my oldest daughter, Julie, never had to be force-fed, either. On Saturday mornings, when the house often was saturated with the aroma of beans baking around partridge or woodcock breasts, she would sit on the stairs and cry because the meal wouldn't be ready until suppertime. Mainers, those girls, from stem to stern. But seeing as special mention has been made regarding waterfowl as table fare, let's draw a bead on sea ducks and their way-off-target reputation of being unfit to eat. Even though you may never have signed your name to a duck stamp, chances are you've heard the oft-recited recipe for cooking sea ducks: "Place the duck on a rock and cook in a hot oven for four hours - then throw the duck away and eat the rock." That, kind reader, is pure poppycock; an old wives' tale spouted assertively by people who, obviously, never tasted the thick, succulent breast meat of, let's say, a properly prepared eider duck. To prove that, I hereupon offer a recipe that will bag the common fallacy that sea ducks are "fish with feathers." To the contrary, sea ducks - eiders, scoters (coots), old squaws - are not fish eaters. The ducks feed on mollusks, i.e., mussels, whelks, periwinkles, the latter being a staple in the diets of black ducks that spend winters on salt water.

Full text: For the most part, people born and raised in this neck of the woods were introduced to game dinners soon after cutting teeth. It comes with the territory. Seldom, then, is anyone late for supper when the menu features venison or partridge breast or moose steaks or rabbit meat. Likewise, it's safe to say no one has to be called to the table twice when waterfowl such as Canada goose, black duck, teal, or wood duck is being served.
Here, my youngest offspring, Hope - so named because my wife and I hoped she was the last of the lot - comes to mind. Not long after she'd had her fill of Pablum, Hope became especially fond of black duck. So much so that when she saw ducks flying over the river, which flows behind our house, she would come running to tell me. Come to think of it, my oldest daughter, Julie, never had to be force-fed, either. On Saturday mornings, when the house often was saturated with the aroma of beans baking around partridge or woodcock breasts, she would sit on the stairs and cry because the meal wouldn't be ready until suppertime. Mainers, those girls, from stem to stern.
But seeing as special mention has been made regarding waterfowl as table fare, let's draw a bead on sea ducks and their way-off-target reputation of being unfit to eat. Even though you may never have signed your name to a duck stamp, chances are you've heard the oft-recited recipe for cooking sea ducks: "Place the duck on a rock and cook in a hot oven for four hours - then throw the duck away and eat the rock."
That, kind reader, is pure poppycock; an old wives' tale spouted assertively by people who, obviously, never tasted the thick, succulent breast meat of, let's say, a properly prepared eider duck. To prove that, I hereupon offer a recipe that will bag the common fallacy that sea ducks are "fish with feathers." To the contrary, sea ducks - eiders, scoters (coots), old squaws - are not fish eaters. The ducks feed on mollusks, i.e., mussels, whelks, periwinkles, the latter being a staple in the diets of black ducks that spend winters on salt water.
Before we begin marinating and slicing and simmering, however, understand that my reason for writing this unlikely column is double-barreled: to deep-six the aforementioned old wives' tale and to reduce the wasting of sea ducks, particularly eiders, occurring with the ever-increasing interest in sea-duck hunting. The season is long, October to mid-January, daily limits are generous - seven on eiders, four on coots - and because the ducks respond well to decoys, hunters usually have ample shooting opportunity. Unfortunately, not all of the ducks shot are being disposed of on dinner tables. Although the daily limit on old squaws is seven, the smaller sea ducks are seldom hunted.
Now, first things first. The recipe, "Sea Ducks Jerome," recently was sent to me by Clarissa Trasko of Penobscot. No stranger to rigging eider decoys, Clarissa hunts with her husband, Fred, a fisheries biologist at the Green Lake National Fish Hatchery in Ellsworth. Clarissa said she received the recipe from Fred Kircheis, a fisheries biologist with the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Obviously, Fred isn't averse to visiting offshore gunning grounds in the darkest and coldest hour preceding dawn.
Although some women would sooner tell their age than part with favorite recipes, Clarissa said "fire away" when I suggested giving Sea Ducks Jerome a shot here. I trust the fisheries biologists won't feel they've been foul-hooked. Also, my apologies for any offense to Jerome.
Fillet the breast meat from several eiders. Marinate the meat for 48 hours in buttermilk contained in glassware or crockery. Afterward, cut the meat into strips. Melt one-quarter pound of butter in a large pan, add three tablespoons of red currant jelly, the juice of half a lemon, a teaspoonful of dry mustard, and one cup of bourbon.
Admittedly, pouring the latter into a pot may be painful, but, believe me, you won't regret it.
After bringing the mixture to a hard boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, add the meat and cook for three to five minutes, depending on how you like meat done.
The recipe doesn't call for it, but soaking the filleted breasts overnight in a pot containing cold water and a tablespoonful of baking soda will remove most of the blood from the meat, thereby reducing the "gamey" taste.
Admittedly, my culinary expertise does not extend beyond toasting English muffins and making instant coffee. However, my wife's abilities with pots and pans are impressive. Better yet, Nancy doesn't shy away from cooking whatever I bring home from the hills or, in this case, the ocean. So it was that a week or so ago she prepared Sea Duck Jerome.
Simply put, it was delicious; by far, the best serving of sea duck I ever stuck a fork into. Without hesitation, I would describe the tender, juicy flavor as similar to roast beef. Allowing, however, that individual tastes differ, I wouldn't expect everyone to give Sea Ducks Jerome such high rating. But I'm sure anyone who tries the recipe will agree that sea ducks have been greatly maligned as being unfit to eat.
After finishing the delectable meal, which was seasoned throughout with expressions of epicurean delight, Nancy asked, "Well, what do you think?" To which I replied, "I think it's too bad the sea duck season has ended."

Abstract: Growing concerns about the damage being done to aquatic habitat have spawned federal and state initiatives to protect the breeding grounds of fish, shellfish and other marine life. On Friday, the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced a plan to identify, conserve and enhance essential marine areas, a plan that could sharply curtail fishing practices, such as dragging, that are seen as damaging to critical habitat. Also on Friday, Rep. Paul Chartrand, D-Rockland, said he will sponsor legislation this session that could lead to certain critical fish spawning grounds along the Maine coast being designated as marine ecological reserves closed to fishing.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Growing concerns about the damage being done to aquatic habitat have spawned federal and state initiatives to protect the breeding grounds of fish, shellfish and other marine life.
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced a plan to identify, conserve and enhance essential marine areas, a plan that could sharply curtail fishing practices, such as dragging, that are seen as damaging to critical habitat.
Also on Friday, Rep. Paul Chartrand, D-Rockland, said he will sponsor legislation this session that could lead to certain critical fish spawning grounds along the Maine coast being designated as marine ecological reserves closed to fishing.
NOAA's plan is the first step being taken to meet essential fish habitat protection mandates included in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act approved by Congress last year. Its purpose is to reverse the decline in fish populations from Alaska to Maine and in the Gulf of Mexico.
Under the mandate, regional fisheries councils and the states must work with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service to identify the essential habitats of all species managed under federal guidelines, which include most finfish, shellfish and marine mammals.
Activities, primarily fishing practices, that damage essential habitat must be mitigated and areas designated as essential habitat also will be given special protection from harm that originates on land, such as pollution and sediment discharge.
In a prepared statement, D. James Baker, the undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere, said NOAA's plan is a response "to the American public's concern about the diminishing quantity and quality of our marine habitat. The fisheries service will be working closely with the regional fisheries management councils, coastal states and other partners to protect and enhance the habitat essential to the fisheries and other living marine resources under our stewardship."
Chartrand's bill is being submitted at the request of constituent Ron Huber, head of the environmental group Coastal Waters Project. It would require the Maine Department of Marine Resources to study the habitat requirements of commercially desirable finfish and shellfish in state waters and to delineate certain spawning sites as off limits to harvesting.
The establishment of marine reserves along the Maine coast to serve as protected fish nurseries has been talked about for decades -- NOAA proposed a midcoast marine sanctuary in 1983 with no results. Huber says "It's time to act. With the drastic decline in fish species we're seeing, common sense tells us we have to set some areas of the ocean aside to let these species recover, to let some part of the marine world simply be."
The midcoast sanctuary proposed by NOAA 14 years ago would have stretched from the tip of the St. George peninsula to Bath. Rather than designate one large block of ocean as a reserve, Huber says the DMR study his proposal requires probably would find a greater benefit to designating several small, specific spawning grounds as reserves.
"There have been excellent studies on the spawning grounds of cod and haddock in the Gulf of Maine. It's fairly easy to see from this work that there are clusters of shoals and ledges in Cobscook Bay and from Penobscot Bay south that could be tremendously productive fish nurseries if left alone. Setting aside one large area would be asking fishermen in that area to commit economic suicide. We don't want that. In other parts of the world where reserves have been created, in fact, you'll see fishermen clustered around the edges of the reserve as it pumps out fish. That alone should be a tantalizing prospect for fishermen," he said.

Abstract: The migration habits of the endangered shortnose sturgeon will not interfere with two construction projects planned along the Kennebec River, according to researchers. Scientists found that thousands of sturgeons are spending the winter near an island above Merrymeeting Bay. The study commissioned by the DOT will not be completed until July, but the initial results indicate the projects can proceed without harming the shortnose sturgeons' existence in the river.

Full text: BATH -- The migration habits of the endangered shortnose sturgeon will not interfere with two construction projects planned along the Kennebec River, according to researchers.
Scientists found that thousands of sturgeons are spending the winter near an island above Merrymeeting Bay.
That's good news for the state Department of Transportation, which plans to replace the Carlton Bridge in Bath. Bath Iron Works is also planning an expansion.
The study commissioned by the DOT will not be completed until July, but the initial results indicate the projects can proceed without harming the shortnose sturgeons' existence in the river.
"If we had found the sturgeon were wintering at the Carlton Bridge site ... that would have knocked us for quite a loop," said Scott Rollins, who is overseeing the study for the DOT.
The study findings must be reviewed by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which enforces the Endangered Species Act, as well as the Army Corps of Engineers.
Last fall, the state hired Thomas S. Squires Jr., a state marine resources scientist, to conduct the sturgeon field study. The $30,000 study uses sonic tags or transmitters implanted in 15 sturgeons to track their movements.
Scientists already knew the Kennebec River's 7,000 to 10,000 sturgeons spend summers in the nearby Sasanoa River feeding off mollusks and large crustaceans. But they didn't know where the fish spent winters.
"It surprised me that the fish headed upriver and not down," Squires said.
Already, the DOT has made plans to modify its construction schedule on the bridge. Rollins said the contractor will not be able to work on the middle section of the new bridge between April 15 and Oct. 1. That will leave two-thirds of the river channel open to migrating sturgeons.
Sturgeons are most threatened now by overfishing.

R.I. tests faux reefs as habitat for lobsters

Abstract: JAMESTOWN, R.I. -- It doesn't look much like the cutting edge of science: a crane methodically picks up boulders and rocks from a barge and drops them into the chilly waters of Dutch Island Harbor on Narragansett Bay. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, using $270,000 from a legal settlement with the owners of the wrecked tanker World Prodigy, has begun building six artificial stone reefs where lobsters can hide. This spring, juvenile lobsters no more than 3 inches long will be delivered to their new home. The reefs, each measuring 30 feet by 60 feet under 15 feet of water, supply what marine biologists believe is the one missing ingredient for lobsters in Dutch Island Harbor, a rocky bottom. Lobsters are abundant a scant half-mile away, but virtually absent from the fine silt of Dutch Island Harbor.

Full text: JAMESTOWN, R.I. -- It doesn't look much like the cutting edge of science: a crane methodically picks up boulders and rocks from a barge and drops them into the chilly waters of Dutch Island Harbor on Narragansett Bay.
But if the experiment works, fishermen five years from now will be harvesting lobsters from these now lobsterless waters, and a 1989 oil spill that killed fish and shellfish by the thousands will be just an unhappy memory.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, using $270,000 from a legal settlement with the owners of the wrecked tanker World Prodigy, has begun building six artificial stone reefs where lobsters can hide. This spring, juvenile lobsters no more than 3 inches long will be delivered to their new home.
"What we are trying to do is mimic the natural ecosystems of Narragansett Bay," explained John G. Catena, the agency's project director. Larval lobsters only 2 weeks old "look for this type of rocky cobble habitat to protect them from predators."
The reefs, each measuring 30 feet by 60 feet under 15 feet of water, supply what marine biologists believe is the one missing ingredient for lobsters in Dutch Island Harbor, a rocky bottom. Lobsters are abundant a scant half-mile away, but virtually absent from the fine silt of Dutch Island Harbor.
A lot is at stake in the lobster experiment, in part because of a far more damaging spill in Rhode Island last January when the barge North Cape ran aground, spilling 828,000 gallons of heating oil into Block Island Sound.
While the World Prodigy spill killed an estimated 175,000 lobsters, federal officials believe the North Cape spill killed 1 million or more, leaving a trail of dead lobsters 3 feet wide and at least a mile long near Point Judith. As a result, Rhode Island's lobster industry was shut down for 13 weeks.
The federal government and lobstermen are still negotiating a damage settlement with North Cape owner Eklof Marine Corp. But if lobster flourish on the man-made reefs of Dutch Island Harbor, Eklof could be required to build many more of them to offset the damage from the 1996 spill.
"This is experimental. We don't even know if {the lobster} will stay. There are no fences," said Bob Smith, president of the 100-member Rhode Island Lobstermen's Association, who nonetheless supports the lobster reefs. "What comes from this will give us ideas of what to do" in the North Cape talks.
Officials from Boston's Central Artery project also are watching Dutch Island Harbor, sending a consultant to see the man-made reefs Tuesday. The Central Artery soon must build a rock-covered habitat for blue mussels in Boston Harbor to replace shellfish beds destroyed at Spectacle Island, where fill from the project is being deposited.
Over the years, government agencies periodically have dropped rocks onto the sea floor to improve conditions for the lobster industry, but, until now, they haven't monitored the results closely enough to know whether the effort pays off, Catena said.
In addition, some fishermen are skeptical as to whether hatchery-raised lobsters actually increase the overall lobster population or if they simply take over territory that would have been occupied by wild lobsters.
This time, working with researchers from the Sea Grant Program of the University of Rhode Island, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is leaving nothing to chance.
The 500 to 1,000 young lobsters that will be placed on the reefs annually over the next four years will have wires implanted into one leg, allowing researchers to track their movements and survival. The wires, which are detected by a magnetic scanner, function like a supermarket bar code, providing detailed information about each lobster.
Also, federal and university officials will place hatchery-raised lobsters on only three of the six reefs, allowing them to compare population growth. Kathleen Castro of the University of Rhode Island believes that many lobsters may move into the harbor on their own.

Abstract: Dr. Henry Ryan never felt the need to take former House Speaker John Martin out for oysters and beer. That allows Ryan to hire the additional staff immediately, without waiting for the new budget in July. The actual annual cost for those two positions is $90,000, according to Attorney General Andrew Ketterer, whose department oversees the Medical Examiner's Office. Of the 950 cases assigned to the Medical Examiner's Office, about 250 bodies end up being autopsied by Ryan or [Kristin] Sweeney. By being selective, Ryan has reduced by 1,000 annually the number of cases being accepted by his office for review.

Full text: BANGOR -- Dr. Henry Ryan never felt the need to take former House Speaker John Martin out for oysters and beer.
Though some of his colleagues across the country who work with vast budgets and ample staff have told him that a plateful of oysters and a pint of beer to the right lawmaker could go a long way toward solving the chief medical examiner's problem.
That problem, of course, being money.
The prestigious doctor's response to such advice is remarkably simple and unmistakably blunt.
"I don't need that crap."
Instead the state's chief forensic pathologist, who is nearing retirement, stood before the Appropriations Committee last week and took a more direct approach in his quest for funding.
"I won't continue to captain a sinking ship, and you won't find anyone else to either."
While the size of the medical examiner's office staff has not increased, the workload has. It's not that more people are dying or that there are more suspicious deaths requiring autopsies. The problem is everything else.
Lawyers, insurance companies, police departments and every statistics-gathering agency in the nation pound on the doors seeking information about the manner in which people die.
Ryan doesn't dispute the importance of the data-gathering portion of his work. Streamlining statistical data and ensuring proper documentation were among the goals when the Chief Medical Examiner's Office was established in 1968.
But perhaps no one imagined how overwhelming compiling such data would become. There are snowmobile groups that want the cause of death on each snowmobiler killed in the state. And suicide prevention groups who want information about every suicide. And so on.
Then of course there is civil litigation, even paternity suits, that require endless tests that have become increasingly expensive to perform.
Ryan made his point and the Appropriations Committee unanimously approved $33,445 for two new positions, a phone clerk and an officer manager, long sought for the office.
That allows Ryan to hire the additional staff immediately, without waiting for the new budget in July. The actual annual cost for those two positions is $90,000, according to Attorney General Andrew Ketterer, whose department oversees the Medical Examiner's Office.
"The problem is that it's very difficult to find qualified people for that job. I have one leaving at the end of this month and the other one was threatening to leave February 15 if he didn't get some help. I mean I could have had people driving around with dead bodies in their cars asking me what to do with them. What am I going to do, ship them out of state?" said Ketterer.
The appropriation is expected to be signed by Gov. Angus King without further inquiry, since the governor suggested that Ryan make the pitch for the positions to the committee.
Those positions actually were approved in 1989, but the paperwork, which was the responsibility of someone in the Attorney General's Office, did not get filed in time and Ryan lost his funding. The next year was the start of the state's budget crisis.
Now Ryan says that the office is in such turmoil that not only is his deputy medical examiner, Dr. Kristin Sweeney, leaving, but that he may well consider leaving much earlier than his planned retirement in a year and a half.
"I want to leave something with a foundation so 21 years doesn't go down the drain," Ryan told members of the Appropriations Committee.
Ryan took on the role of chief medical examiner in 1975 and is credited with building the system that exists today.
Ryan, who is nationally renowned in his field, says that his office has been chronically underfunded for years. His office staff includes himself, Sweeney who plans to leave her position at the end of this month for another job, two autopsy assistants and two clerks. He also oversees a contractual medical examiner's staff of 250, though the vast majority of those are not active.
The number of staff has not changed since 1979, with the exception of one additional autopsy assistant.
Contractual medical examiners are located throughout the state and are certified to perform external examinations of bodies, determine a cause of death and sign the death certificate.
They consult with Ryan or Sweeney on those cases, most of which involve routine deaths.
If the death is routine or expected and the deceased is under the care of a physician, that physician can sign the death certificate, such as in the case of a cancer victim.
More complicated cases are assigned to the Medical Examiner's Office for review.
Of the 950 cases assigned to the Medical Examiner's Office, about 250 bodies end up being autopsied by Ryan or Sweeney. By being selective, Ryan has reduced by 1,000 annually the number of cases being accepted by his office for review.
With limited resources, Ryan has had to learn to set priorities.
"If a man with a heart problem stands up, clutches his chest and shouts, `Elizabeth, I'm coming to join you. It's the big one' and subsequently drops dead, chances are I'm not going to waste the taxpayers' money performing an autopsy and a multitude of tests on the body. No matter what the insurance companies want," Ryan said.
But the requests from other groups or people bogs down the system. Many times those individuals want information that Ryan does not consider scientifically relevent.
"And most of them of course want the information right now," Ryan said.
Perusing four piles of files accumulated on his desk, Ryan flips through them dramatically.
"These are not autopsies. Nor are these or these or these," he shouts.
Viewing one more closely, he exclaims, "This is from an attorney who wants results from a blood test. It's a 1994 case, but he needs the information right now."
While he talks, his clerks meander in and out of the office sticking phone messages in front of him. Four or five pile up during the two-hour interview.
It's all become just a bit too complicated for this 58-year-old man, who passionately enjoys fishing, reading classics and attending Mass.
To Ryan, the office's most important responsibility is identifying contagious diseases, such as outbreaks of meningitis, E. coli or tuberculosis.
"In cases of unexplainable death in healthy young people, it is absolutely essential to get to the bottom of it," Ryan said, "first and foremost, to prevent further deaths."
In some of those cases, the search may turn up genetic problems, which are critical to identify so that the deceased's family can know about potential problems in other or future family members.
Advances in genetic science have fortunately allowed for more testing to better identify genetic deficiencies, but those tests are expensive and the cost comes directly from Ryan's budget.
Ryan's second priority is to the criminal justice system. It's simply not enough anymore for medical examiners to say the person died of a gunshot wound. It is imperative that the work be complete and well documented.
Police officers and prosecutors want to know the cause of death, the time of death, the distance from which the person was shot, whether there were powder burns on the body, the condition of surrounding tissue and so on.
Such cases often involve consultations with toxicologists, entomologists, anthropologists and other pathologists.
Ryan is meticulously thorough, a characteristic appreciated by those in law enforcement.
His commitment to such important tasks finds him up at 4 a.m. every day typing his own autopsy reports, or performing other types of paperwork. The clerical staff in his office is so overwhelmed by other duties that autopsy reports can take up to six weeks to get typed.
Ryan or Sweeney then must prepare for trial and testify in court of their findings. Doing so sets Ryan up for a barrage of sometimes senseless questions, especially by defense attorneys searching for acquittal.
During one murder trial, Ryan was being questioned by an aggressive attorney who repeatedly asked the doctor if it was possible that the murder victim committed suicide or died of a heart attack.
"I think five bullet wounds to the temple would rule out suicide," Ryan testified. "And I find it highly unlikely that he died of natural causes and then someone shot him five times in the head," as the defense attorney seemed to suggest.
Ryan went on to testify that he supposed he could not rule anything out, including the possibility that an elephant fell from the sky and fired the bullets into the man's head.
Ryan has not much use for the justice system, when trials appear more scripted for show than justice. Science has allowed for such advanced testing that questions are being answered today that would never have even been asked 10 years ago.
The Medical Examiner's Office also performs tests in cases that may not involve criminal prosecution, but civil litigation. Cases such as fatal car or snowmobile accidents or fire deaths.
In doling out his limited dollars, Ryan is careful where the money is spent. He won't, for example, perform autopsies on accident victims who obviously died of head trauma, simply because an insurance company wants to make sure that the driver did not suffer a heart attack before crashing into the tree.
He's not afraid to say no and for that he often takes criticism.
"I'm not willing to pay for the tests involved in the off chance it may make a difference in a civil case," he said.
But they are tough decisions and he gets tired of making them.
So does his esteemed Sweeney, who will leave to work for UNUM Corp. at the end of this month.
She will not miss wearing her accountant's hat on one side of her head and her physician-scientist hat on the other.
Take the case of a 1-year-old child who died mysteriously.
During the course of examination, Sweeney knew right away that she needed to take a look at possible genetic problems.
She reviewed the family history, did a standard autopsy, with routine specimen testing. She did blood tests, toxicologies and tissue examination.
She did a metabolic screening, which involves sending a blotter of dried blood to a reference lab where they test for 30 of the most common genetic metabolic diseases.
The entire time she was taking the samples, performing the tests and sending samples away for testing, the cash register in her head was ringing.
How far should she go to search for the cause of the child's death?
The tests finally indicated the child had a genetic defect that affected microscopic filaments within her cells. Those filaments are the source of the cell's energy. When they don't work right a person is vulnerable to a variety of diseases.
There were more tests that could have been done to try to identify the exact abnormality. Sweeney tested for the most common abnormality caused by the genetic deficiency and it came back normal.
Ideally she would have continued in her search. Realistically, she could not.
"These are important tests for the surviving family members, and the potential children they may have in the future," she said.
These are the judgment calls she no longer cares to make.
With the $33,000 appropriated to him, Ryan hopes to hire an office manager and a phone clerk. Despite all of the scientific technological advances in his field, Ryan's office does not yet have voice mail.
Sweeney's $94,000 a year salary remains in the budget, which will allow him to hire a new deputy chief or perhaps someone to replace himself.
He no longer enjoys the job much and it will depend on the circumstances of the qualified candidates on how long he stays.
"If during the interview process the candidate whom I think would make the best choice would rather come in as chief, I would certainly step down," Ryan said.
With any state agency, budgets are always tenuous. Ryan says his office can't continue to function unless more money becomes available to attract qualified pathologists.
The alternative is an unpleasant prospect to police officers and prosecutors.
"I would suspect if the office was unable to function, we would revert to a county by county system. You'll have police and prosecutors who no longer have a central department to deal with. The results of that would be death investigations that aren't good," said Dr. Edward David, a contractual deputy medical examiner and a Bangor neurologist.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Maine's volunteer-driven effort to clean up and protect its coast has earned kudos of the finest kind from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
NOAA, a branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce, issued its evaluation of the State Planning Office's Maine Coastal Program this week, citing "outstanding improvements" made in the program, and dishing out special praise for the high level of volunteer work being done in such areas as pollution and habitat surveys, coastal cleanups and historic preservation.
The report comes on the 20th anniversary of the Maine Coastal Program and the 25th of the federal Coastal Zone Management Act, which charged NOAA with identifying nationwide coastal problems and setting goals to resolve those problems.
A NOAA team toured the state last September, evaluating 17 coastal protection and improvement projects in operation from Wells to Lubec, which fall under the umbrella of the state program.
Projects singled out by NOAA as being especially beneficial to the health of the shore included the seven-town cooperative effort to protect the Damariscotta River estuary, a state program to train and certify local code enforcement officers in coastal zone management, and the Shore Stewards Partnership and the Penobscot Bay Marine Volunteer Program, which train local residents in water-quality monitoring and other coastal issues.
Noting that the efforts of hundreds of volunteers to improve the coastal environment have resulted in the direct economic benefit of reopening thousands of acres of shellfish flats previously closed to harvesting by pollution, John McLeod, leader of the NOAA evaluation team, said the "success of Maine's program can really be connected to the way the people who run the program have gotten coastal communities involved in helping the coast. When we see so many people doing so much for the coast, we know right away we have an outstanding program."
In its 25 years of administering the Coastal Zone Management Act, McLeod said NOAA has found "that a balance between using the coast and preserving its resources is critical to the health of the coast and even to a state's economy. Finding a balance really demands that communities get involved."
Paul Dest of the State Planning Office said Wednesday the sparkling report card "is very welcome, but the high praise has to go to the hundreds upon hundreds of volunteers in communities up and down the coast. Their work in just one area alone -- water-quality monitoring -- is invaluable in locating sources of pollution and in increasing the public's awareness of the great impact what we do on land has upon the marine environment."
Dest said the attention NOAA gave to the Damariscotta River project "is particularly noteworthy. The plan these seven communities developed has won several awards and is being used as a model across the country for watershed management. It's a great example of value of volunteerism and regional cooperation."

Abstract: For a while it looked as though the clamming industry in Maine was in trouble, with flats being closed because of pollution and federal regulations. But now an army of clam diggers, local shellfish wardens and environmentalists battling to save the flats are beginning to have success. Throughout Maine, state officials reopened about 10,000 acres of clam flats in 1996. In Freeport, state regulators are expected to open 170 acres of flats in the next couple of months. The openings would make 98 percent of Freeport's clam flats available for clamming, up from 35 percent in 1991. Yarmouth plans at the end of this month to offer its first commercial clamming licenses in a decade.

Full text: PORTLAND -- For a while it looked as though the clamming industry in Maine was in trouble, with flats being closed because of pollution and federal regulations.
But now an army of clam diggers, local shellfish wardens and environmentalists battling to save the flats are beginning to have success. Throughout Maine, state officials reopened about 10,000 acres of clam flats in 1996.
"A lot of us felt for a while that we wouldn't have jobs," said Stan Burnham, who is 36 and has worked as a clammer on and off since he was 15. "But now clamming has a good future."
In Freeport, Falmouth, Yarmouth and towns all up and down the coast, the state is reopening clam flats that have been closed for years.
In Freeport, state regulators are expected to open 170 acres of flats in the next couple of months. The openings would make 98 percent of Freeport's clam flats available for clamming, up from 35 percent in 1991. Yarmouth plans at the end of this month to offer its first commercial clamming licenses in a decade.
Besides preserving Maine traditions, the openings save jobs. In 1995, 1,666 licensed clammers in Maine harvested about 150 million clams and sold them for more than $8 million.
The cleanup effort also benefits wildlife and anyone who swims in Maine's waters or eats any kind of seafood, because it ensures the waters are clean.
"Keeping water safe for clams keeps it safe for everything, from lobsters to children swimming on the beach," said Mick McGivaren, Freeport's shellfish warden.
Fecal coliform has caused most of the clam-flat closures. The bacteria found in human and animal waste leaches into the tidal flats from sewage pipes, outdated septic systems and farmers' fields. Eating clams contaminated with the bacteria makes people sick.
When coastal development in the 1980s increased the amount of pollution flowing into the flats, the federal Food and Drug Administration tightened clamming regulations, requiring lower pollution levels and more extensive clam-flat monitoring. As a result, clamming was illegal by 1991 on nearly 20 percent of the state's clam flats, an area covering about 350,000 acres.
The situation was even worse in heavily-developed areas such as Casco Bay, where half the clam flats were shut down by 1993.
At the same time, budget cuts made it nearly impossible for the state to do the extensive pollution-source surveys and water testing necessary to reopen flats. The Department of Marine Resources has only six field operators to monitor the entire Maine coast.
"We were placed behind the eight ball," said Paul Anderson, director of the state's shellfish sanitation program. "We needed help."
Local environmental groups and town governments stepped in with cleanup and water monitoring efforts. Because of their help, only about 13 percent of the state's clam flats remain closed.

Toxicologist studies dioxin, fish

Author: Smith, Andrew

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]18 Jan 1997: 1.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/413852636?accountid=10457

Abstract: A recent column appearing in a weekend edition of the Bangor Daily News spoke of the ubiquitous presence of dioxins in our environment and the need to consider other dietary sources of dioxin than fish or lobster tomalley ("Of dioxin, fish and hamburgers," by Dr. Marquita Hill, Jan. 4-5). As the state toxicologist responsible for recommending the issuance of fish and shellfish consumption advisories to Maine's risk managers, I would like to respond to this column out of concern that some readers may conclude that the current fish and shellfish consumption advisories are unnecessary. First, I want to emphasize that the Maine Departments of Human Services, Environmental Protection, Inland Fish and Wildlife, and Marine Resources have jointly issued consumption advisories urging women of childbearing age to abstain from consuming any lobster tomalley (the green stuff in the body of the lobster technically referred to as the hepatopancreas) taken from Maine coastal waters, or any fish taken from the Androscoggin River, Kennebec River below Skowhegan, and Penobscot River below Lincoln. Others are encouraged to limit their consumption from these waters. These advisories remain in effect. How is it, one might ask, the public health officials could determine it necessary to issue such consumption advisories if as Dr. Hill states, "lobster tomalley is a tiny source" of dioxin; and why is it, she asks, that "if most human exposure to dioxin comes from meat and dairy products, we only hear about fish?" It is because the intake of dioxin from consuming lobster tomalley and fish only appear to be small sources relative to say beef intake of dioxin, when one computes dietary intakes based on national average food consumption rates and national average background concentrations of dioxin (as was done in the 1994 EPA document cited by Dr. Hill). These national food consumption rates average together the behavior of people who consume very little of a given food with those who consume a lot, and everyone in between.

Full text: A recent column appearing in a weekend edition of the Bangor Daily News spoke of the ubiquitous presence of dioxins in our environment and the need to consider other dietary sources of dioxin than fish or lobster tomalley ("Of dioxin, fish and hamburgers," by Dr. Marquita Hill, Jan. 4-5). As the state toxicologist responsible for recommending the issuance of fish and shellfish consumption advisories to Maine's risk managers, I would like to respond to this column out of concern that some readers may conclude that the current fish and shellfish consumption advisories are unnecessary.

Others are encouraged to limit their consumption from these waters. These advisories remain in effect.
Having said that, it is important to emphasize that we have not issued any type of advisory on eating lobster meat, as the concentration of dioxin in the meat tissue is considerably lower than concentrations in tomalley.
How is it, one might ask, the public health officials could determine it necessary to issue such consumption advisories if as Dr. Hill states, "lobster tomalley is a tiny source" of dioxin; and why is it, she asks, that "if most human exposure to dioxin comes from meat and dairy products, we only hear about fish?" It is because the intake of dioxin from consuming lobster tomalley and fish only appear to be small sources relative to say beef intake of dioxin, when one computes dietary intakes based on national average food consumption rates and national average background concentrations of dioxin (as was done in the 1994 EPA document cited by Dr. Hill). These national food consumption rates average together the behavior of people who consume very little of a given food with those who consume a lot, and everyone in between.
Use of average background dioxin concentrations in dietary foods ignores areas with higher contamination of dioxins due to known point discharges of dioxins into the environment (e.g., paper mill wastewater effluent). These national estimates of average dioxin intake are important information to be used in assessing national population exposure and health risks. It is not necessarily the appropriate information for states to use when determining the need for consumption advisories to protect those individuals who consume more fish or shellfish than the average person, who happen to consume fish or shellfish with higher than average concentration of dioxins, or who happen to be uniquely sensitive to the toxic effects of dioxin.
The issuance of fish and lobster tomalley consumption advisories in Maine results from the fact that moderate levels of consumption of these foods (a meal a week) when taken from the above mentioned waters reults in dioxin intake above amounts at which we become concerned about the potential for developmental and reproductive toxicity. When assessing the potential for developmental or reporductive toxic effects, toxicologists have to consider the possibility that short-term exposure to a toxicant may be all that is needed to cause a toxic effect. This is because there are critical windows during pregnancy when the developing fetus in uniquely sensitive to chemical insult. Thus, when assessing the need for fish or shellfish consumption advisories, it is prudent public health policy to consider the possibility that some women of chilbearing age may ingest a number of fish or tomalley meals over a relatively short period of time (consider the pregnant woman on vacation in Maine duirng the summer). Over these shorter periods of time, intake of dioxin from lobster tomalley and fish can be the major sources of dietary exposure.
That we have not issued consumption advisories for meat or dairy products does not mean that these dietary sources are of no concern -- they may be, if further study confirms that limited initial data on levels of dioxins in these other dietary foods. However, it is worth noting that nutritional advice given to the public by state and federal health agaencies for prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer (i.e., limit intake of meats and dairy products with high fat content and when eating meat, eat lean cuts) fortuitously also has the benefit of reducing intake of dioxins, as these chemicals accumulate in fatty tissues. I also want to emphasize that our current focus on fish and shellfish as dietary sources of dioxin does not mean people whould decrease their consumption of fish. Rather, the advisories are only urging people to avoid consuming fish from selected waters. Eating fish is good for you, and is to be encouraged -- another bit of nutritional advice given by public health agencies. Notably, the limited data on open ocean fish suggest dioxin contamination levels are low.
While widespread contamination of dietary foods with dioxin is unfortunate, there is good news to be told. There are ongoing federal and state programs to control dioxin emissions from the major emission sources thought to be contributing to this widespread contamination of food chains. National data suggest that dioxin concentrations in the envionment and in human body tissues are decreasing.
Here in Maine, both fish and lobster tomalley dioxin concentrations have been decreasing in response to ongoing efforts by the paper industry to reduce their discharge of dioxin into rivers. Governor King's initiative to bring Maine's stakeholders together to work toward further reducing the discharge of dioxins into our rivers will continue this trend, allowing us to eventually rescind all dioxin-related fish consumption advisories.
Dr. Andrew Smith is the state toxicologist within the Maine Department of Human Services, Bureau of Health, Division of Disease Control. Dr. Smith also holds an appointment as a research associate in the Department of Envionmental Health at the Harvard School of Public Health, and is a course instructor in Harvard's Center Continuing Professional Educaiton course: Analyzing Risk: Science, Assessment and Management.

Bill would scrap town clam rules Statewide standard urged

Abstract: The bill, sponsored by Sen. Marge Kilkelly of Wiscasset, would scrap the myriad town clam harvesting rules and replace them with one statewide standard -- and one state clamming license. Although specifics of the bill are still to be written, the Lincoln County Democrat says battle lines already are being drawn. Under the current system, towns or groups of towns that have formed regional shellfish committees set the number of clam licenses they will issue each year, reserve most for town residents and make a small number available to nonresidents by lottery. State law requires municipal and regional shellfish ordinances to make the number of nonresident licenses no less than 10 percent of the number of resident licenses issued, and sets the maximum cost of a license at $200 for residents and $400 for nonresidents. In addition, commercial diggers must buy a $63 state license. Maine has about 1,600 commercial diggers.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- A proposal to abolish municipal shellfish ordinances creates the potential for a collision between two of Maine's most cherished traditions -- local control and open access to marine resources. It is expected to lead to heated testimony before the Marine Resources Committee this legislative session.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Marge Kilkelly of Wiscasset, would scrap the myriad town clam harvesting rules and replace them with one statewide standard -- and one state clamming license. Although specifics of the bill are still to be written, the Lincoln County Democrat says battle lines already are being drawn.
"I've had a lot of calls about this. People are either very opposed or very supportive," Kilkelly said. "Nobody's in the middle. It definitely will be a big issue because it's an important issue. It's an issue of fairness."
Under the current system, towns or groups of towns that have formed regional shellfish committees set the number of clam licenses they will issue each year, reserve most for town residents and make a small number available to nonresidents by lottery.
State law requires municipal and regional shellfish ordinances to make the number of nonresident licenses no less than 10 percent of the number of resident licenses issued, and sets the maximum cost of a license at $200 for residents and $400 for nonresidents. In addition, commercial diggers must buy a $63 state license. Maine has about 1,600 commercial diggers.
Although there is considerable variation in what municipal and regional ordinances charge for licenses, few, if any, make more than the bare minimum available to nonresidents, according to Department of Marine Resources statistics.
For example, the ordinance jointly adopted by Wiscasset and Woolwich charges residents and nonresidents the same $150 for a license, but diggers must buy a separate license for each town. Each town issues 10 resident licenses a year and only one nonresident license.
A new five-town shellfish organization for Thomaston, South Thomaston, Warren, Cushing and St. George charges residents and nonresidents the maximum allowed by law for licenses, $200 and $400. The district sells 125 resident licenses per year and offers just 12 to nonresidents.
"It's the only fishery we administer that way and it's simply unfair," Kilkelly said. "The economic reality of the coastal regions is that the very people who rely on clams for essential income can no longer afford to live in the coastal communities. They're forced inland and are being cut off from this resource. Open access to a vital resource for all the people of Maine is, in this case, more important than home rule."
Kilkelly was elected to the Senate last fall after four terms representing House District 57. "Over the years, as the municipal ordinances gained strength, I'd hear from more and more of my inland constituents who were being shut out. As nonresidents in a lottery, they had maybe a 1-in-10 chance at getting a license.
"There's been a real domino effect -- as one town passed an ordinance that was very restrictive to nonresidents, the next town over would adopt one even more restrictive. I've heard of people who had to spend up to $1,000 for licenses as a nonresident," she said.
"We're supposed to be supporting small business development. Well, what's a smaller business than one guy out digging clams? The ability to earn a living should not be decided by these artificial boundaries, by what town you live in," she said.
Kilkelly said some municipal and regional committees have done good work in enforcement, flat reseeding, water-quality monitoring, and in making conservation work a condition of licensure "but it's been spotty. Some invest a lot into the resource, some do very little. I'd like to see the best of what the municipalities have done become the state standard."
The law would not take effect until next January, Kilkelly said, "to give us time to determine what the cost of this one state license should be and to set up a mechanism to continue using the expertise of the local shellfish committees in matters of conservation. We will need more state wardens, so the license fee has to be enough to raise the standard of enforcement, yet be more reasonable than what nonresidents of coastal towns are paying now, without placing any more burden on the local property tax."
Kilkelly said she expects strong opposition from coastal towns, "so I plan on working hard with the inland legislators to show them how their constituents are being shut out of this resource. I'm enough of a realist to know that this may not pass the first time around. If not, I'll at least use this as an opportunity to educate people on the negative way so many Maine citizens are being impacted by our current policies."

Full text: BANGOR -- Hardly a creature was stirring on Wednesday, the sights of snowmen and the sounds of laughing children replaced by a peaceful silence.
On a distinctly unwhite Christmas, the tolling of the noontime church bells echoed past the empty sidewalks and storefronts of downtown Bangor.
But behind closed doors, people celebrated the holiday in their own way, meeting loved ones, watching movies or simply trying to earn a living.
In a dramatic crescendo of leaping flames and clanging pans, Ke-Shih Cheng resembled a video on fast-forward as he prepared the evening meals at State Street's Szechuan Garden. In just five minutes, Cheng, the restaurant's owner and chef, waved the steam away and produced a mouth-watering ensemble of shrimp in soy sauce and garlic chicken.
In the restaurant, Cheng Ouyang, the waiter on duty, was humming along to "Jingle Bell Rock" and thinking of Dec. 25 in his native Taiwan.
"It's called Constitution Day," he said. "It was a long time ago and I don't remember much about it. But I know we didn't have to work."
The owner smiled and chimed in, "We're open because it's convenient for the customers."
At Bangor International Airport, it was a day of many meetings and remembrances. And there couldn't have been grandparents more eager than Forest and Constance Kane of Gouldsboro.
In a Santa Claus hat, Forest Kane, 73, looked out the window overlooking the runway for signs of his grandaughter, Misty Fogg, a high school cheerleader living with friends and going to high school in Virginia Beach, Va.
"You know these young girls," he said as they waited. "Before they get off the plane they have to fix their hair and straighten their clothes."
The couple squinted and pointed the way teen-agers might await the sighting of a rock star.
"I see her," he said. "She probably can't see us through that little window," said Constance Kane, 63. The young woman finally made it through the gate, and her grandparents leaped from their front-row seats for a long-awaited hug.
Across town at the Greater Bangor Area Shelter, visitors shared a turkey lunch and presents provided by donors from throughout the region.
There were gifts from the second-graders at McGraw Elementary School in Hampden, wrapped in papier-mache and decorated with crayons. There were gloves, boots and turtlenecks collected by visiting nurses from stores such as L.L. Bean. Two presents were set aside for Vietnam veterans.
Christmas decor mixed with the center's warnings against drug abuse and unsafe sex, producing the strange sight of a ceramic Santa resting against a box of free condoms. According to Dennis Marble, the shelter's director, 34 people stayed at the shelter on Christmas, ranging from the homeless to recovering drug addicts and the mentally ill.
"We've had some emotional issues this morning because of where people find themselves on this holiday," said Marble.
But as they finished off a piece of Christmas cake, Anthony Brazzo and Christie Chessa celebrated the first anniversary of their meeting and looked forward to a wedding in August.
"You were sitting at the table in the corner and staring at me," remembered Chessa, 19, most recently of Brewer.
"We played cards but we were never on the same team," said Brazzo, 32, of Boston.
They met almost a year ago in January. Chessa was homeless, and Brazzo was seeking counseling for alcohol and drug addiction. Not everything has been rosy for the couple this year -- Brazzo was imprisoned briefly for theft -- but they said they now have an apartment and are looking forward to a new life in Bangor.
"We were living in Boston," he said. "I had to get away from there, from the gangs and the drugs. I'm not about to go back.
Bangor has a lot to offer. We've been given clothes and furniture. And like today, you can sit and talk to people."
Even though their circumstances may not have called up a Dickens story or a Norman Rockwell painting, local people found ways to enjoy the holiday.
Residents at the Phillips-Strickland House in Bangor assembled Wednesday afternoon in the dining room to partake of a festive Christmas dinner prepared by the kitchen staff. Some elderly residents of the boarding home had invited friends and family to join them for the feast, while others planned to visit relatives later in the day.
Marjorie Wentworth, 90, was counting on spending the afternoon curled up with a romantic novel. Wearing a bright red sweater with a holiday motif, the former teacher said that she would forgo the usual visit to relatives' homes, since climbing stairs had become difficult for her.
"This is my extended family, anyway," she said, pointing to the other residents, who sat chatting happily with each other, as they dug into steaming plates piled high with turkey, roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy and boiled onions.
"I saw all my relatives on Thanksgiving," said 91-year-old Thelma Emery, "so I thought it would be nice to be with everyone here.
"And look what they do! They make it so festive!" added Emery, pointing to the gaily decorated tables, the bowls filled with shimmery red jello molds, the elegantly arranged relish trays.
"This is a good place to be!" agreed Peter Allen of Brewer, who had come to share Christmas dinner with his 89-year-old mother, Clara. Allen had brought his 24-year-old son, Peter Jr., here for the holidays from Manhattan.
After everyone was served, the kitchen crew, wearing white aprons and bright red Santa Claus hats, sat down to enjoy the feast.
Having to work on Christmas presented no problem whatsoever, they agreed.
"We get to be with a lot of nice people here," said Darlene Scripture of Hermon.
"This is our first family," declared Ella Getchell of Old Town as she looked around the dining room. "Next we'll be off to visit our own families -- our second families!"
Across town at the Concord Trailways Bus Station, Andrea Lyon, in a bright red Santa Claus hat, waited to board the 3:15 p.m.
express bus to Boston after spending Christmas with her parents in Machias.
Lyon, 30, was heading back to Simmons College in Boston where she is studying library science.
According to her parents, Jane and Elden, their daughter had been sporting the hat when she arrived in Bangor Dec. 22.
"I needed something to get me in the Christmas spirit!" the young woman said, laughing.
Meanwhile, bus driver Frank Hanscome was preparing for the run to Boston.
Hanscome said he had volunteered to work on the holiday. "I wouldn't know what to do if I didn't work on Christmas,"
said the genial bus driver, who celebrated the holiday last Saturday with his family in Scarborough.
Hanscome said that although his passengers would receive their usual snack of crackers and juice, they would be treated to the movie "Miracle on 34th Street" in honor of Christmas.
As of midafternoon, it was the movie, "Michael," which was drawing the largest Christmas Day audiences, according to Mark Cemodanovs, assistant manager of Hoyts Cinemas in Bangor.
Ed and Helen Vandenburgh of Corinna and Helen's mother, Bessie Flagg of Dexter, had chosen instead to watch "The Preacher's Wife" at the theater complex.
Although they had spent a traditional Christmas Eve opening presents and dining on oyster stew with other members of the family, the Vandenburghs were looking for a way to make some new Christmas memories. This Christmas was the first without Wyman Flagg, Bessie's husband and Helen's father, who died last spring. "The movie was fantastic!" said Ed Vandenburgh, as the family prepared to leave for home. "It was a nice way to vary the Christmas routine."
Meanwhile, Bill Perry, the manager of MacDonald's Market in Bangor, said it had been a typically busy Christmas Day.
Perry said that Christmas and Thanksgiving generally represent the store's "busiest days, moneywise."
"Everyone else shuts down," said Perry, recalling a steady stream of customers who had come in for "bread, milk, sugar, and whatever else they need to finish up their Christmas dinner."
Although, he remembered, there was that one customer who apparently was determined to defy tradition.
"Someone came in and bought a frozen salisbury steak dinner," Perry said, with a laugh.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- A joint U.S.-Canadian organization has drafted a blueprint for the protection and management of the Gulf of Maine into the next century.
At a recent meeting in Fredericton, New Brunswick, the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment adopted a new five-year plan that will help guide the work of government and private agencies committed to the stewardship of the gulf and its watershed. Five major topics are identified in the plan: restoring shellfish habitat; promoting the restoration of groundfish; addressing ecosystem and public health effects of toxic contaminants in the marine food chain; protecting and restoring significant coastal habitats; and reducing marine debris.
The council was created in 1989 by the state and provincial governments of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to foster cooperative action on protecting and restoring the gulf.
The new plan, which covers the period 1996-2001, is a sequel to the first plan released in 1991, which laid the groundwork for guiding state, provincial and federal policies.
Some specific goals of the new plan are to reduce by 10 percent from 1990 levels the amount of toxic contaminants in bays, assisting in the restoration of 10,000 acres of significant coastal habitat, and improving the water quality in 12,000 acres of shellfish habitat.
David Keeley of the Maine State Planning Office said the council's work in its first seven years has been "a combination of educational programs, information sharing and hands-on projects to improve the marine environment. Our new plan builds on that, it looks for areas in which the council can help three state and two provincial and federal governments achieve something that's in everyone's interest -- a healthy and productive marine environment.
One of the council's first accompishments, Keeley said, "was to break what I call the `filing cabinet syndrome' that keeps information locked up in one government agency. The council's Web site is an electronic clearinghouse that makes all the information and research on the gulf available to all government agencies, researchers, academic institutions and the public -- anyone who is interested in the gulf.
Hands-on projects assisted by the council "have focused to a considerable extent on reducing marine debris, a significant problem. In Rockland, for example, the council helped finance the construction of a used oil container on the wharf. In general, the council looks for projects that are under way through a state, provincial or local initiative and could use some help."
Although the council does not have the force of law to back its positions, Keeley said, it "does have the strong support of three governors and two premiers, which gives a considerable amount of moral suasion. It's similar to other international agreements in that it builds on the common interests and the common goals."

Full text: ST. GEORGE -- The Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment has awarded Sherman Hoyt of St. George its 1996 Visionary Award.
Hoyt was cited for his work to create clam management organization and open shellfish beds in the Georges River. He worked with local residents and the University of Maine Cooperative Extension and initiated a program to develop a clam management agreement and ordinance for five towns on the river.
Hoyt also trained clam diggers to identify pollution problems and as a result of these efforts, 700 acres of product clam flats were opened to harvesting in July.
Evan Richert, a council member and director of the Maine State Planning Office, said: "The work of Sherman Hoyt and the Gulf of Maine Aquarium has improved the quality of the Gulf of Maine Environment. They exemplify the good work occurring in the gulf, and their receipt of these awards is well deserved."

Eastport clammers oppose closed cove Diggers clash with panel's protection effort

Abstract: At around 11 a.m., wardens and Eastport and Maine State Police officers arrived. He said members of the Eastport Marine Resources Committee confiscated the nine bushels of clams and threw them on the beach. He said the clam diggers lost $450 worth of clams. Eastport police Officer Robert Gregory, who summoned six diggers, said he went to Carrying Place Cove after he received a report that the clam warden was having problems with diggers there. When he arrived, he said, there were about 18 men yelling at one another. He said the situation calmed down when police officers arrived. Although diggers are allowed to dig two bushels per tide at Carrying Place Cove, several diggers proposed an end to that limit. But others feared that move would seriously deplete the resource. "I think you've got to have a limit if you want to dig year-round," said Eastport digger Joel Dickey.

Full text: EASTPORT -- The Eastport Marine Resources Committee's effort to protect Carrying Place Cove by opening only a small portion of it to shellfish harvesting met with opposition over the weekend when clammers who strayed into the closed area were summoned by police.
Eastport digger Herbert Mitchell said that somehow the stakes that marked the line between the open and closed areas were removed, and he and some other clammers strayed over the line Sunday.
At around 11 a.m., wardens and Eastport and Maine State Police officers arrived. He said members of the Eastport Marine Resources Committee confiscated the nine bushels of clams and threw them on the beach. He said the clam diggers lost $450 worth of clams.
Eastport police Officer Robert Gregory, who summoned six diggers, said he went to Carrying Place Cove after he received a report that the clam warden was having problems with diggers there. When he arrived, he said, there were about 18 men yelling at one another. He said the situation calmed down when police officers arrived.
Monday night about 20 clammers were at the Marine Resources Committee meeting to protest the fact that they could dig on only 60 of the 240 acres at Carrying Place Cove. The cove is located off Route 190, near the Eastport scenic sign.
The resources committee was created about four years ago, but the Eastport Shellfish Conservation Ordinance that regulates clamming activities in the community, was approved only in November 1995. The committee has five members, appointed by the City Council and each serves for three years.
Before those clam flats were opened, committee members and diggers met to discuss how the resource should be managed. The diggers agreed to the 60-acre site, and they also agreed to harvest no more than two bushels per tide. Orange--tipped stakes were put in place to mark the open area. Public hearings were held by the City Council and the recommendations of the resource committee were approved.
During the first week, the clammers remained in the open area, but over the weekend the stakes mysteriously disappeared, and several diggers were found digging in the closed area.
Monday night, diggers said they wanted the open area at Carrying Place Cove extended to at least half the cove, but they could not agree on how many acres should be opened, or how many bushels a digger should be allowed to harvest each tide.
Eastport resident Will Hopkins, who acted as moderator, wondered how long the clammers would be satisfied if the line were placed at the midpoint of the cove.
"Until I start starving. Until the light bill gets behind. Then I'll be down here knocking on your door again," Eastport digger Tommy Cook said.
In addition to opening up more of Carrying Place Cove, several diggers suggested another conservation measure, to allow digging on only one tide, banning night digging. But that suggestion was opposed by most of the diggers at the meeting.
Although diggers are allowed to dig two bushels per tide at Carrying Place Cove, several diggers proposed an end to that limit. But others feared that move would seriously deplete the resource. "I think you've got to have a limit if you want to dig year-round," said Eastport digger Joel Dickey.
The one thing diggers seemed to agree on was that they didn't agree.

Full text: FREDERICTON, New Brunswick -- The states and provinces bordering the Gulf of Maine adopted a new five-year plan Friday aimed at restoring and preserving the area's rich marine habitat.
Members of the Gulf of Maine Council said the main thrust of the plan is to rebuild shellfish beds, restore wetlands and reduce toxic contaminants in the bays of the gulf.
"It's a detailed blueprint to address the key issues concerning the environmental future of this precious international resource," said council Chairman Bernard Theriault, New Brunswick's fisheries minister.
The Gulf of Maine stretches from Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, to Cape Cod, Mass., and includes Georges Bank and the Bay of Fundy.
Fishing and shellfishing have been major industries in the gulf, sustaining the work of nearly 20,000 fishermen and contributing hundreds of millions of dollars to the region's economy in recent years.
The Gulf of Maine Council includes representatives from Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Its mission is to maintain and improve the gulf's environmental quality while allowing people to use its resources.
New Brunswick environmentalist Janice Harvey, who attended the council meeting as an observer, was critical of the council and its objectives.
She said that in the six years since the council was created, its major accomplishment was improved communication between state and provincial bureaucracies.
"But we have seen no serious look at fish stocks, no action on some of the major problems," she said.
"We know, for example, that many commercial species use rockweed as very critical habitat, yet the New Brunswick Department of Fisheries, which chairs this council, is promoting a commercial rockweed harvest in the Bay of Fundy. Those two things are inconsistent."
She said the commercial fishery, already closed in some parts of the gulf, could disappear along with the spectacular bird migrations of the upper bay.
Harvey said environmentalists in the gulf region are organizing a Gulf of Maine alliance to put political pressure on the council "to get out there and start doing something."

Abstract: Thanksgiving now was dawning! We children poked one another, and fairly giggled with unreproved delight as we listened to the crackle of the slowly unfolding document. That great sheet of paper impressed us as something supernatural, by reason of its mighty size, and by the broad seal of the State affixed thereto; and when the minister read therefrom, "By his Excellency, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a Proclamation," our mirth was with difficulty repressed by admonitory glances from our sympathetic elders. Then, after a solemn enumeration of the benefits which the Commonwealth had that year received at the hands of Divine Providence, came at last the naming of the eventful day, and, at the end of all, the imposing heraldic words, "God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts." And then, as the congregation broke up a dispersed, all went their separate ways with schemes of mirth and feasting in their heads.

Full text: Harriet Beecher Stowe moved to Maine in 1850, with her husband, Calvin Ellis Stowe, a professor at Bowdoin College. In Brunswick, she wrote her famous "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and many stories about New England life, including "The Pearl of Orr's Island" (1862) and "Oldtown Folks" (1869). The latter offers a vivid description of Thanksgiving soon after the Revolutionary War, and is a particularly fitting reminiscence for today.
Are there any of my readers who do not know what Thanksgiving day is to a child? Then let them go back with me, and recall the image of it as we kept it in Oldtown.
People have often supposed, because the Puritans founded a society where there were no professed public amusements, that therefore there was no fun going on in the ancient land of Israel, and that there were no cakes and ale, because they were virtuous. They were never more mistaken in their lives. There was an abundance of sober, well-considered merriment; and the hinges of life were well oiled with that sort of secret humor which to this day gives the raciness to real Yankee wit. Besides this we must remember that life itself is the greatest possible amusement to people who really believe that they can do so much with it, -- who have that intense sense of what can be brought to pass by human effort, that was characteristic of the New England colonies. To such it is not exactly proper to say that life is an amusement, but it certainly is an engrossing interest that takes the place of all amusements. ...
When the apples were all gathered and the cider was all made, and the yellow pumpkins were rolled in from many a hill in billows of gold, and the corn was husked, and the labors of the season were done, and the warm, late days of Indian Summer came in, dreamy and calm and still, with just frost enough to crisp the ground of a morning, but with warm trances of benignant, sunny hours at noon, there came over the community a sort of genial repose of spirit, -- a sense of something accomplished, and of a new golden mark made in advance of the calendar of life, -- and the deacon began to say to the minister, of a Sunday, "I suppose it's time for the Thanksgiving proclamation." ...
We also felt its approach in all departments of the household, -- the conversation at this time beginning to turn on high and solemn culinary mysteries and receipts of wondrous power and virtue. New modes of elaborating squash pies and quince tarts were now ofttimes carefully discussed at the evening fireside by Aunt Lois and Aunt Keziah, and notes seriously compared with the experiences of other Aunties of high repute in such matters. I noticed that on these occasions their voices often fell into mysterious whispers, and that receipts of especial power and sanctity were communicated in tones so low as entirely to escape the vulgar ear. I still remember the solemn shake of the head with which my Aunt Lois conveyed to Miss Mehitable Rossiter the critical properties of mace, in relation to its powers of producing in corn fritters a suggestive resemblance to oysters. As ours was an oyster-getting district, and as that charming bivalve was perfectly easy to come at, the interest of such an imitation can be accounted for only by the fondness of the human mind to works of art.
For as much as a week beforehand, "we children" were employed in chopping mince for pies to a most wearisome fineness, and in pounding cinnamon, allspice, and cloves in a great lignumvitae mortar; and the sound of this pounding and chopping re-echoed through all the rafters of the old house with a hearty and vigorous cheer, most refreshing to our spirits. ...
At other times of the year we sometimes mummured at these labors, but those that were supposed to usher in the great Thanksgiving festival were always entered into with enthusiasm.
There were signs of richness all around us, -- stoning of raisins, cutting of citron, slicing of candied orange peel. Yet all these were only dawning and imitations of what was coming during the week of real preparation, after the Governor's proclamation had been read. ...
The cheering anticipation sustained us through what seemed to us the long waste of the sermon and prayers; and when at last the auspicious moment approached, -- when the last quaver of the last hymn had died out, -- the whole house rippled with the general movement of complacency, and a satisfied smile of pleased expectation might be seen gleaming on all the faces of the young people, like a ray of sunshine through a garden of flowers.
Thanksgiving now was dawning! We children poked one another, and fairly giggled with unreproved delight as we listened to the crackle of the slowly unfolding document. That great sheet of paper impressed us as something supernatural, by reason of its mighty size, and by the broad seal of the State affixed thereto; and when the minister read therefrom, "By his Excellency, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a Proclamation," our mirth was with difficulty repressed by admonitory glances from our sympathetic elders. Then, after a solemn enumeration of the benefits which the Commonwealth had that year received at the hands of Divine Providence, came at last the naming of the eventful day, and, at the end of all, the imposing heraldic words, "God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts."

Marine life weathered oil spill Long-term effects on creatures in Portland's Fore River unclear

Abstract: Preliminary studies indicate that the Sept. 27 oil spill in the Fore River caused no widespread mortality or oiling of marine life, but there is still concern about the spill's long-term impact. "We found a much more rich and diverse community down there than anybody expected to find," [John Sowles] said, expressing confidence that the immediate impacts of the spill were minimal. Seth Barker, oil spill coordinator at the Maine Department of Marine Resources, says he expected the survey to find plenty of dead shellfish, considering the magnitude of the spill and the fact that there was toxic No. 2 fuel oil in the mix.

Full text: PORTLAND -- Preliminary studies indicate that the Sept. 27 oil spill in the Fore River caused no widespread mortality or oiling of marine life, but there is still concern about the spill's long-term impact.
"There's always that question of {impaired} growth and reproductive effects and that sort of thing down the road," said John Sowles of the state Department of Environmental Protection.
Green crabs, periwinkles, anemones and other creatures that dwell on the river bottom appear to be healthy and active, as do finfish, mussels and clams, the preliminary studies found.
A diver who swam under the bow of the crippled tanker Julie N just 10 days after it struck a bridge and spilled 170,000 gallons of oil into the river found that even those waters were unexpectedly teeming with life.
"We found a much more rich and diverse community down there than anybody expected to find," Sowles said, expressing confidence that the immediate impacts of the spill were minimal.
Researchers from six states and federal agencies have been working over the past few weeks on a "pre-assessment" of the damage caused by the spill. These initial studies, estimated to cost $322,000, will help determine if more long-term research is needed and will lay the groundwork for a restoration plan.
Seth Barker, oil spill coordinator at the Maine Department of Marine Resources, says he expected the survey to find plenty of dead shellfish, considering the magnitude of the spill and the fact that there was toxic No. 2 fuel oil in the mix.
"They seem to have survived the exposure to the oil," he said. Many of the studies are ongoing, with their final results not expected until December or January, according to Paul VanCott of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
As a result, no formal conclusions about the damage to natural resources will be made until after the first of the year.
"As a practical matter, however, we will move as quickly as possible to restoration planning because we don't want to spend more time studying impacts than we have to," VanCott said.

Abstract: "I feel relieved," said George MacLeod, president of Friends of Fort Knox, which formed five years ago after voters in Maine nixed repairs to the fort for a second time in two years. "I feel that this is a major turning point for the Friends of Fort Knox," he said. The $1 million in repairs to Fort Knox was part of a $3 million bond issue to fund capital improvements to state parks and historic sites, including making them handicapped-accessible. Returns at 2 a.m. showed 59 percent of the voters approving the bond and 41 percent opposed. Even though support outpaced the opposition from the outset, early on MacLeod expressed some uncertainty about losing ground in southern Maine because the funds largely would go toward improvements in eastern and northern Maine.

Full text: Mainers were in a spending mood Tuesday, backing $40.5 million in bond issues to clean up sewer systems and landfills, jump-start small businesses and fix up historic sites and parks in the state.
Early Wednesday morning, with 83 percent of the state's 646 precincts reporting, returns showed consistently strong support for the bonds, with most being endorsed by almost three-fifths of the voters.
It was never even close. That was good news for backers of the bonds and especially for the Friends of Fort Knox, an organization that has battled for about five years for increased attention and financial support for the most heavily visited historic site in the state.
"I feel relieved," said George MacLeod, president of Friends of Fort Knox, which formed five years ago after voters in Maine nixed repairs to the fort for a second time in two years. "I feel that this is a major turning point for the Friends of Fort Knox," he said.
The $1 million in repairs to Fort Knox was part of a $3 million bond issue to fund capital improvements to state parks and historic sites, including making them handicapped-accessible. Returns at 2 a.m. showed 59 percent of the voters approving the bond and 41 percent opposed.
Even though support outpaced the opposition from the outset, early on MacLeod expressed some uncertainty about losing ground in southern Maine because the funds largely would go toward improvements in eastern and northern Maine.
That seemed to make little difference. Almost half of the $3 million approved would go toward improving Churchill Dam, which controls water levels in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway. The waterway serves outdoorsmen and fisheries and is a natural habitat for fish and fowl.
The largest of the bond issues before voters, Question 5, would pump $16.5 million into statewide efforts to clean up massive automobile tire stockpiles, close solid waste landfills to safeguard drinking water supplies, and fund efforts to reduce hazardous discharges into the environment. It too was generating hefty support, with about 61 percent in favor.
Meanwhile, the bond issue for small business ventures received the greatest support, garnering 65 percent of the votes.
"I hope it carries through as the night goes on; this is critical for the state of Maine to move forward," said Charles Mercer, a spokesman for the Finance Authority of Maine, which would administer the small business loans that are part of the $11 million Question 6.
Through the sale of the bonds, the state would establish a $6 million loan program for agriculture and natural resource-based companies like farms and acquaculture enterprises that have potential but are considered risky investments by banks.
Small manufacturers would also be eligible for loans under the $5 million Small Enterprise Growth Fund, which targets businesses in high-growth fields that need a hand up. Companies eligible for the loans include those involved in marine sciences, biotechnology, precision manufacturing and computer software.
Upgrading of sewer treatment plants and public water systems was the impetus behind the $10 million bond issue Question 7. This bond received the public's backing with 63 percent of the vote.
With passage of the question will come $10 million in federal grants that will be combined with $2 million from the bond issue for loans to municipalities to improve sewer treatment facilities and to abate untreated discharges from sewer overflows.
Other money from the bond issue would be used to replace the Waldoboro Utility District discharge system, which is below environmental standards and has resulted in state officials closing nearby areas to shellfish harvesting.
Late Tuesday afternoon before polls closed, Secretary of State Bill Diamond was predicting that the bond issues would fare well with voters. The four bond issues represented the smallest bond request since 1989 and generally, Diamond said, people are feeling good about the economy.
And when they're feeling good, they tend to be more willing to approve bonds, according to state statistics.
The fate of a bond issue could also depend on happenstance, something as simple as where it appears on the ballot.
"There's always the fear that going down the ballot, voters will start to feel poor and not want to spend quite as much money when it gets down to the bottom," Diamond said. "It doesn't happen all the time, but it is a concern."
Overall, Maine voters have been fairly liberal about opening their wallets and purses and spending money. Based on statistics from Diamond's office, Mainers have approved bonds about 68 percent of the time since 1985.

Full text: EASTPORT -- At the crack of dawn, under a violet- and orange-streaked sky, engines roared and scores of scallop boats fanned out Friday to fish South Bay and the myriad other coves and inlets in Cobscook Bay.
Maine's 1996 inshore scallop season, which opened at sunrise on Nov. 1, drew scores of scallop draggers lured by the prospect of making as much as several thousand dollars for a day's catch of the pearly-white marine creatures. Some boats anchored overnight to have first crack at the rich scallop beds in South Bay, Gouldsboro Bay and other prime areas.
On patrol since 4 a.m. Friday, Maine Marine Patrol Specialist David Dent and Officer Jodi Mosher said South Bay resembled a Christmas parade as dozens of draggers, their red and green navigational lights glowing in the dark, got a head start toward the fishing grounds.
"It looked like all of Lubec was coming up the bay," said Dent as he and Mosher headed out from Eastport for a second round of patrolling aboard the Marine Patrol vessel Machias.
Expecting an onslaught, the Marine Patrol and U.S. Coast Guard were out in force all along the coast. In a well-coordinated operation, their officers boarded scallop draggers to ensure they were equipped with proper safety and fishing gear. They also were present to assist in case boats collided, fishing drags got entangled, lobster gear got damaged or some other incident triggered by overcrowding occurred.
Also on hand to monitor the situation were Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden; Herman Backman Jr., the DMR's regional coordinator and former president of the Downeast Lobstermen's Association; and Bob Peacock, chairman of the DMR's Marine Advisory Council.
Flying in a Marine Patrol plane up to Eastport early Friday morning, Alden said she had spotted 50 to 60 scallop draggers clustered around Black and Placentia islands off Mount Desert Island and a similar number concentrated in Gouldsboro Bay. She said there did not seem to be nearly as many draggers as reported last year.
"It's a lot of boats but it's not more than we expected," Alden said. "The Coast Guard has been a godsend. I don't know what we would have done without them."
Petty Officer Dave Candee, supervisor of the U.S. Coast Guard's search-and-rescue unit in Eastport, agreed there were fewer scallop draggers than last year. He counted 130 boats in Cobscook Bay.
"We had anticipated a heck of a lot of boats. This year was pale by comparison to last year," he said.
Candee said there were no boating accidents and few safety violations were found. He noted many scallop boats had voluntarily participated in the Coast Guard's marine safety program prior to opening day.
For a decade now, the DMR has prohibited scalloping in certain inshore areas for all or part of November. The season closes April 15.
The partial opening was instituted to prevent gear conflicts between scallopers and lobster fishermen. November is a prime month for lobstering. It's the time of the year when lobsters make their annual migration to deep, offshore waters where they spend the winter. Traditionally, lobster fishermen have kept their gear in the water to catch the crustaceans as they move offshore.
But the scallop season's staggered opening has put pressure especially on Gouldsboro Bay and other prime areas open to fishing from the start. On opening day, scallop draggers descend on those open areas still dotted with lobster traps. Lobstermen charge the overcrowding not only threatens their gear but also the migrating brood stock and juvenile lobsters.
In Cobscook Bay, local scallop fishermen complain the area is stripped clean in a matter of weeks, leaving them nothing to harvest the rest of the season. They also fear the heavy fishing is harming the scallop brood stock and juvenile population.
In addition, Cobscook Bay is subject to extreme tidal ranges that cause fast currents, choppy seas and tide rips. On opening day, the convergence of scallopers, many of whom are from out of town, makes dragging there even more perilous. A few years ago, two scallop boats got tangled and divers had to cut the drags.
Last month, Harvey Crowley, a Corea lobsterman and president of the Downeast Lobstermen's Association, said the towns of Gouldsboro, Steuben and Winter Harbor plan to petition the Legislature to close Gouldsboro Bay annually until Dec. 1.
Sitting with her legs braced on the stern of the Machias, as the Marine Patrol boat charged out of Eastport, Alden said her department is seriously considering a Dec. 1 opening for all scalloping areas, and other alternatives to the present staggered season.
"We are seeking a better way to open the scallop season," she said. "This kind of opening is not the optimal way to run a fishery, but a change would involve the scallop, shrimp, lobster and groundfish fisheries and the issues are very complex."
Ahead, the scene resembles a regatta. Scores of scallop draggers are scattered across South Bay. The boats zigzag across the choppy waters, managing miraculously to stay out of each other's path. They leave great brown swaths where sediment from the bottom of the bay has been kicked up from repeated tows.
"It's a scallop factory," Marine Patrol Capt. David Dent says, surveying the scene, with binoculars from the helm of the Machias. The Machias draws up to a red-hulled dragger from Lubec. The drag is hauled up and rocks, crabs, scallops, seaweed, starfish and sea urchins cascade onto the "dumping" table. The crew sort through the muddy pile, tossing legal-sized scallops into plastic totes.
"A lot of little ones compared to last year," Capt. Mel Gallant tells the Marine Patrol officers who use a brass ring to gauge whether the scallops measure at least the minimum legal size.
Undersized scallops was the main fishing violation found on more than a dozen fishing boats boarded by Dent and Mosher by early afternoon. Some of the juvenile mollusks discovered were as small as a silver dollar.
Commissioner Alden said the multitude of juvenile scallops bodes well for the 1997 scallop season, and she urged fishermen to toss the undersized creatures back into the sea.
"The abundance of undersized scallops is a good thing," Alden said. "If people stay off of them, they'll be there next season and worth a lot more money."

Abstract: Do you favor a $10,000,000 bond issue for the following purposes: (1) $8,000,000 to construct water pollution control facilities, providing the state match for $10,000,000 in federal funds; and (2) $2,000,000 to address environmental health deficiencies in drinking water supplies? In the past 30 years, the state and its communities have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up residential and commercial sewage and waste. The results have been spectacular on Maine's rivers. The benefits are obvious. The cost, however, is significant. This bond will continue that work, and make it more affordable in key areas.

Part of a continuing investment in the quality of the Maine environment, the largest share of this bond, $8 million, will be combined with federal funds to pay for expansion or upgrading of waste water treatment plants.
In the past 30 years, the state and its communities have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up residential and commercial sewage and waste. The results have been spectacular on Maine's rivers. The benefits are obvious. The cost, however, is significant. This bond will continue that work, and make it more affordable in key areas.
This bond is the first in three years to provide funds for construction and expansion of large centralized sewage treatment facilities. The $4 million for this purpose isn't nearly enough to significantly ease the financial pain on most municipalities, but it will help by reducing the amount some towns or districts will have to borrow to finance construction.
Revolving loan programs under the aegis of the state have worked well in Maine. This bond issue will create one for communities and districts that must improve their water systems to comply with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The $2 million from Question 7 will be combined with federal funds to make loans, at no interest, for these local projects.
Proponents of the bond issue point out that more than 800 public water systems in Maine may be eligible to apply for these loans next year. The challenge to the state will be to devise a system of its own for filtering these requests and funding them in order of priority.
An additional $1 million from the bond will be distributed through the Small Community Grants Program. This will help sparsely populated Maine communities, where central collection and treatment plants are impractical, target their help to specific homes and businesses. Last year, 247 individual systems were built with these funds.
The bond also provides $1 million to pump up the Overboard Discharge Program that replaces commercial and residential systems that pollute coastal drainage areas and shellfish beds. This program can transform these areas, making them productive for shellfish harvesting and pollution free.
Maine voters have seen previous bond issues similar to Question 7. They have been approved. This one also deserves a YES vote.

Full text: MONTREAL -- A year after the referendum that nearly split Canada in two, Quebec is as polarized as ever, its economy in disarray, and its morale soured by ceaseless debate over separatism.
Officially, Quebecers who opposed independence were the victors on Oct. 30, 1995, casting a bare majority 50.6 percent of the votes that were tallied during an evening of wrenching tension.
In many ways, however, the outcome turned Quebecers on both sides into victims. In part because of political uncertainty, outside investment in Quebec has shrunk and thousands of people are leaving for other provinces. Montreal's 12.6 percent jobless rate is the highest of any big Canadian city.
"Nobody should have to live with a sword of Damocles constantly hanging over their heads," Prime Minister Jean Chretien said during a recent foray into Montreal to preach the rewards of Canadian federalism.
Quebec's separatist-led provincial government doesn't minimize the economic woes. Premier Lucien Bouchard is convening a three-day summit of business and labor leaders Tuesday to seek a consensus on deficit-cutting, job creation and tax policies.
Bouchard hopes to gain support for painful government spending cuts that would, in a few years, prove to Quebecers and outsiders that his Parti Quebecois is capable of governing an independent, solvent nation.
And he wants the province on firmer financial footing when the next referendum takes place, perhaps in four or five years.
Monique Simard, vice president of the Parti Quebecois, said the turn of the century could be a highly symbolic moment for Quebec, though she stopped short of predicting the referendum would be held then.
"Four, five, six years -- in politics that's an eternity," she said in an interview. "But people who've been strong sovereigntists for 20, 25 years agree with our timetable. They are patient. It will happen some day."
Chretien and his federalist allies insist separation is not inevitable, but their strategies vary from week to week, sometimes in contradiction.
Several prominent Quebec federalists were upset when the national government decided in September to ask the Canadian Supreme Court for a ruling on whether Quebec has the right to secede unilaterally.
Justice Minister Allan Rock said the point was to show that Quebec, if it did vote to secede, would face tough negotiations over division of government debt and assets. But the move seemed to play into separatist hands.
"It's an attempt to treat Quebec as a captive people," said Bouchard.
Federalists strive to show Quebec the benefits of staying in Canada. Chretien just announced an interest-free, federal loan of $64 million to help Quebec's Bombardier Inc. develop a new passenger jet.
Yet some federalists can't resist spotlighting any bit of economic bad news in Quebec, hoping hard times will eventually erode the popularity that Bouchard consolidated with his passionate referendum campaigning last year.
Support for independence increased steadily in post-referendum opinion polls, peaking at 55 percent in June.
Since then, the trend has reversed. The latest monthly survey by the Montreal polling firm of Leger and Leger gave the federalist side a slight edge.
"It's clear that for Lucien Bouchard the honeymoon is over," said pollster Jean-Marc Leger.
"People are looking for effective government, not more talk about the constitution," he said.
Though bread-and-butter issues may be paramount for most Quebeckers, hard-liners in both the French-speaking majority and the Anglophone minority have ensured a persistent nastiness in the political climate.
Parti Quebecois militants have successfully pressed for tougher enforcement of language laws that restrict the use of English on signs.
Meanwhile, an aggressive English-rights movement has arisen for the first time, staging protests and rallies. One of its leaders, Howard Galganov, plans to defy language laws at a store to be opened in November and has dared Bouchard to make him a political prisoner.
Though most Quebecers speak at least a little of the other community's language, a deep gulf remains.
It was a rare occasion Wednesday at Magnan's, a beer-and-oysters tavern in Montreal, when talk-show hosts from French and English radio stations arranged a joint live broadcast. Tavern patrons and radio listeners engaged in lively bilingual discussion of whether the two communities can get along.
Gilles Proulx, a feisty separatist who is host of a show on the French station CKAC, gave a gloomy prognosis.
"Did we really talk to one another since last year?" he asked. "I'm not sure. I think this is very sad for the future of Quebec." Proulx contended it is easier for white and black leaders in South Africa to work together than for English and French speakers in Quebec.
But Proulx probably spoke for may on both sides with another comment.
"I'm fed up talking about this," he said. "I'd rather talk about hockey."

On Route 1A north of Ellsworth, [Henry Aho] said, the DEP has equipped six households with water filters. He said the ground water was contaminated by a waste oil collection operation from 1963 to 1980. He said the next step will be to pinpoint the contamination's origin and determine how best to deal with the hazardous material. In the Washington County town of Meddybemps, Aho said, the Green Hill Quarry contains gravel contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, commonly known as PCBs. He said the carcinogenic material is believed to have infiltrated the gravel from leaking electrical transformers. He said the gravel pit is not being quarried. [Tom Gocze] was given a FAME loan guarantee for only $72,000 on a loan from a bank and said the $150,000 maximum in the enterprise loan would have been better.

Full text: Four of the eight referendum questions on the Nov. 5 ballot ask Maine voters to approve issuing state bonds worth more than $40 million to finance a variety of environmental, economic and capital improvement projects.
If all four 1996 bond issues - listed as Questions 4 through 7 on the ballot - are approved, taxpayers will be obligated to repay $40.5 million in principal and a projected $11.5 million in interest.
The long-term borrowing package has generated little public debate or discussion, although a coalition of business, municipal and environmental organizations is supporting passage.
The Economic and Environmental Improvement Coalition says "prudent investments' not only will protect natural resources but also will stimulate the economy and improve Maine's cultural and recreational attractions.
The largest bond issue, Question 5, would raise $16.5 million for several environmental cleanup projects around the state. It includes funds for cleaning up hazardous waste, reducing dangerous scrap tire stockpiles and covering solid waste landfills.
Question 4 asks for $3 million to repair and improve state parks and historic sites. Another $10 million is requested by Question 7 to address drinking water and water pollution concerns.
The bond issue in Question 6 would provide $11 million to help create jobs through low-interest loans to small farm enterprises and small businesses with potential for growth.
Each bond issue is examined below. Question 4: Parks, historic sites Ballot Question 4 asks voters whether they support a $3 million bond issue to make capital improvements at state parks and historic sites. According to state officials, the objective of the bond issue is to "keep Maine's state park system a safe, attractive and vital part of the tourism economy."
The largest portion of the expenditure, $1.4 million, would fund the replacement of Churchill Dam, which controls water flow for canoeists and fisheries managers in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway.
"The Allagash is part of Maine's tradition and heritage, the epitome of the North Woods, and the most outstanding multiday canoe trip," said Herbert Hartman, director of the state Bureau of Parks and Lands.
The most recent dam was built in 1968, with a structural life expectancy of 15 to 20 years. A bond issue to replace the dam was defeated in 1990.
Hartman says deteriorating timbers at Churchill Dam have caused compression and settlement of the structure, impeding the proper function of the dam's gates. Continued deterioration would eventually result in the collapse of one or more of the timber cribs, making it difficult or impossible to control water levels. A consultant's study has predicted significant impacts on recreational resources if the dam is no longer functional. Water levels on Churchill and Eagle lakes are expected to drop from 3 to 7 feet depending on the season.
Chase Rapids, the renowned 9-mile stretch of the Allagash below Churchill Lake, would not be boatable during low-flow periods in July and August, and the stretch between Musquacook Stream and Michaud Farm would be as much as 20 percent lower.
The brook trout fishery would be diminished, and togue populations would drop as lower water levels adversely affected spawning areas, said Hartman. Waterfowl habitat would be reduced, as would flood control benefits.
The second-largest apportionment of bond issue funds would be $1 million to complete roof and masonry restoration at the Fort Knox State Historic Site in Prospect.
"Fort Knox is the state's most heavily visited historic site," said Hartman. "It's like the Allagash. It's one of the things that plays a unique role in the state's heritage."
The secretary of the interior has listed Fort Knox, a massive granite structure built to protect the Penobscot River in the mid-19th century, as a high-priority National Historic Landmark, due to the extent to which it is threatened by deterioration.
Funds would be used to finish final phases of capital improvements there.
Hartman said the Friends of Fort Knox, together with the bureau, had raised $900,000 toward improvements. But the roof is only half done, and interior masonry still needs work.
Friends spokesman George MacLeod says the fort has sustained water damage over the past 50 years due to failure of the roof and drainage system. The cumulative effects of moisture problems have caused sections of the fort to be closed to the public.
Without remedial work, the structure will soon pass the point of cost-effective restoration, MacLeod said recently.
The third expenditure of the bond issue would be $600,000 for renovations to make state parks and historic sites accessible to the disabled.
The Bureau of Parks and Lands has already provided some improved access, through existing funds, for its 50 state parks and historic sites. While new facilities under construction are being made accessible, significant needs remain at older sites.
Improved access to buildings, campsites, and recreational facilities is needed. Upgrades at public restrooms, pathways, trails, boardwalks, and parking lots would benefit the general public as well as the disabled, said Hartman.

Question 5: Environmental cleanup Hazardous-substance sites will be cleaned up, scrap tire stockpiles will be eliminated, and nearly two dozen Maine communities will be reimbursed for solid waste landfill closures if the $16.5 million "Environmental Bond," referendum Question 5, passes Nov. 5.
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection would use $2.5 million to investigate and clean up hazardous substance sites. Some $5 million would finance removal of tire stockpiles, and $9 million would be distributed to Maine cities and towns as reimbursement for closing solid waste landfills.
Since the mid-1980s, Maine voters have authorized $14.5 million for hazardous-substance cleanups. To date, the DEP has received and investigated 400 reports of contaminated sites. DEP officials say substantial work remains to be done at 50 locations.
In many of the cases, DEP officials say site investigation and cleanup costs are covered by the private parties who generated the hazardous substances.
Henry Aho, supervisor of the DEP's Uncontrolled Hazardous Substance Site Program, says much of the $2.5 million earmarked for hazardous substance cleanup would be used to cap an abandoned industrial landfill in the Oxford County town of Paris.
The balance, Aho said, would be used to deal with ground-water contamination affecting private residences in Ellsworth, PCB-contaminated soil at the Green Hill Quarry in Meddybemps and other long-overdue cleanup projects.
"We have sites which have been on the back burner for a while that we need to deal with," Aho said Thursday. "They are not sites in highly populated areas, but they need to be addressed."
On Route 1A north of Ellsworth, Aho said, the DEP has equipped six households with water filters. He said the ground water was contaminated by a waste oil collection operation from 1963 to 1980. He said the next step will be to pinpoint the contamination's origin and determine how best to deal with the hazardous material. In the Washington County town of Meddybemps, Aho said, the Green Hill Quarry contains gravel contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, commonly known as PCBs. He said the carcinogenic material is believed to have infiltrated the gravel from leaking electrical transformers. He said the gravel pit is not being quarried.
Aho said the Ellsworth and Meddybemps projects could wind up on the back burner again should another hazardous-substance site posing a greater public health threat surface. He said the Eastland Woolen Mill in Corinna has the potential to be one such site. He said chlorobenzene, a flammable liquid used to dye wool, has contaminated the immediate area's ground water.
"It's definitely a public health threat," he said. Voters will decide whether to authorize $5 million for the continued elimination of scrap tire stockpiles throughout Maine.
The state produces about 1.7 million scrap tires annually. The five largest piles boast 40 million scrap tires.
Jim Glasgow, a DEP environmental specialist, says tire stockpiles are a fire hazard. He said tire fires can cause significant environmental damage from toxic soot fallout and oil and water runoff.
"Our big focus has been fire," he said Thursday. "The only way we can have any assurance is to remove these tire stockpiles and send them to recycling operations."
Glasgow said the $5 million would be used to eliminate the state's largest pile of 20 million scrap tires in Bowdoin. He said stockpiles in Durham, Greenwood, Nobleboro and Meddybemps are also targeted.
If the Environmental Bond passes, $9 million will be distributed to Maine cities and towns that closed and capped their solid waste landfills during this year's construction season.
In the late 1980s, the Legislature mandated the closure of municipal landfills to protect drinking water supplies. To date, Maine voters have approved seven landfill closure bonds totaling $59 million. Some 261 of 392 municipal landfills have been shut down.
Ted Wolfe, coordinator of the DEP's Landfill Closure and Remediation Program, expects 22 municipalities will have closed their landfills by year's end and will be entitled to reimbursement. He said the state will reimburse 75 percent of the communities' costs.
Wolfe said Augusta, Waterville, Litchfield, Houlton, Corinna, Eastbrook, Franklin, Tremont, Jonesport, Columbia Falls, Danforth and Machias are among the communities that will likely benefit from the bond issue.
Wolfe said Maine has one of the most proactive landfill closure programs in New England.

Question 6: Job growth, economy Tom Gocze runs Access Technologies, a small business in Bangor with big ideas. But as an inventor looking for ways to improve energy efficiencies in the home, Gocze has found it difficult to find backing for his projects.
Financial institutions are often gun-shy of new products which have not yet been proved and have no guarantee of success. And the banks, he said, are looking for immediate returns in a field where there are often dry spells and paybacks are sometimes slow.
In November, Maine voters will be asked on referendum Question 6 to approve $11 million in bonds aimed at making it easier for small businesses to upgrade or expand their existing facilities, spread out into new markets, or develop new products.
The bonds, if approved, would be broken down into two categories: $6 million for agriculture and natural resources-based industries and the remaining $5 million for enterprising businesses with high-growth potential.
Although Mainers have approved bond issue loans for the potato industry and for economic recovery during the credit crunch in the past, these new loans would reach businesses previously not afforded access to the low-rate loans.
"This bond issue is designed to meet needs that we've never tried to meet before," said Charles Mercer, director of external affairs for the Finance Authority of Maine, which would administer the programs. A special 11-member board appointed by the governor will make the decisions on the investments in the Small Enterprise Growth Program.
Both loan programs are revolving-door projects, meaning that as the loans are paid back, the funds will be made available for new loans.
Mercer said the loans are a way to create new jobs in emerging and expanding high-tech industries such as biotechnology, software development and pharmaceuticals at a time when traditional industries such as textiles and footwear are declining. They also are expected to help bolster other traditional Maine industries such as dairy farms and new ones such as cranberries.
Under the Small Enterprise Growth Fund, entrepreneurs and small-business owners would be able to borrow up to $150,000 to support their business efforts. The loans must be matched at least equally with funds from other sources, and borrowers are assessed a fee that would be used to cover any loan losses.
What makes this fund different is that loan repayments can be deferred. Interest still accrues on the loans but payment on these capital loans could be delayed for six months or a year, perhaps longer, giving companies time to develop their products and markets. Loans also could be paid back based on how well the company is doing.
"We want to give them time to breathe," Mercer said. Such a loan would have made a difference, Gocze said, with a project a few years ago that went sour. Gocze developed a hot-water heater that ran on solar power during the day and on electricity during off-peak times when electric rates were lower, saving the consumer money.
Gocze was given a FAME loan guarantee for only $72,000 on a loan from a bank and said the $150,000 maximum in the enterprise loan would have been better. The flexible repayment schedule could have helped Gocze expand into out-of-state markets where demand for solar power and use of off-peak electric rates was in greater demand. Instead, Gocze's funding ran out within a year while the bills have taken years to pay off.
The largest of the two loan programs, at $6 million, is the Agricultural Marketing Loan Fund. This loan fund expands upon the 1981 Potato Marketing Improvement Fund, which offered loans to help improve the quality and shelf life of Maine potatoes by funding improved storage facilities and centralized packing plants.
From about $5 million 15 years ago, the potato fund has grown to about $14 million, according to Mercer, and has resulted in a combined $32 million investment by banks, the businesses themselves and through the loans.
While the potato fund was limited to just one area, the Agricultural Marketing Fund will be open to businesses involved in aquaculture, animal husbandry, farms and businesses that process, store or market these products.
To be eligible, businesses can't borrow more than 55 percent of the cost of projects under $50,000 and 45 percent of the cost for projects that exceed $50,000.
John Harker, business development specialist with the Maine Department of Agriculture, sees many uses for it.
Aroostook County potato farmers could expand into alternative crops, such as wheat for the growing microbrewery industry or for feed for pig and beef operations in Canada. High-tech sprayers that reduce the amount of pesticides used on apple crops could be bought and apple crops could be bolstered by atmospherically controlled storage facilities and deer fences.
Gov. Angus King has pointed to Maine's developing cranberry industry as being ripe for these loans.

Question 7: Drinking water Towns ready to upgrade aging sewer treatment plants and public drinking water systems could qualify for funds if referendum Question 7 is approved by voters on Nov. 5.
The $10 million bond issue would provide $8 million to upgrade and replace water pollution control facilities and $2 million to improve public drinking water systems as required under the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Many Maine municipalities could benefit from the bond issue. The aim of several upgrades would be to eliminate pollution in coastal areas and streams, according to Dennis Purington of the Department of Environmental Protection. Areas now closed to shellfish harvesting could be reopened once treatment plants are upgraded or replaced, one of the largest projects the bond would fund.
According to Purington, $4 million of the bond proceeds would be directed toward replacement projects, with the Waldoboro Utility District expected to be the primary recipient. The Waldoboro district needs to replace its discharge system, which now does not meet environmental standards. Once replaced, the state could reopen adjacent areas to shellfish harvesting.
No bond issue has authorized funding for those types of facilities since 1993, Purington said.
The state's revolving loan fund could receive $2 million if the referendum passes, matching funds for $10 million in federal dollars. Several local communities, such as Bar Harbor, are now benefiting from the revolving loan program, which has an interest rate lower than the commercial rate. The fund helps municipalities upgrade sewage treatment facilities and eliminate or abate untreated discharges from sewer overflows.
Two $1 million projects are also included in the bond issue. The first, to be distributed through the Small Community Grants Program, could benefit individuals and businesses in more than 60 communities. Through that program, state grants would be directed to homeowners and businesses who need to upgrade their own sewage systems to eliminate inadequately treated discharges. Twenty-year loans are available through the program.
Communities which could benefit include Bangor, Brewer, Bucksport, Castine, Cherryfield, Clifton, Cranberry Isles, Dover-Foxcroft, Eagle Lake, Lubec, Otis, Sullivan, Swans Island and Winterport among many others.
The second $1 million would be distributed through the Overboard Discharge Program. Grants under that program target residential and commercial systems that discharge waste into shellfish harvesting areas or into small streams. There are 16 communities likely to win grants, if the bond is approved. They include Vinalhaven, North Haven, Owls Head and several other towns along the southern coast.
Public drinking water systems also will benefit if the bond issue passes. Two million dollars would be directed to a revolving loan program for communities which must upgrade their water systems to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Congress passed last month a revolving loan program for public water systems, which means the $2 million at the state level will be matched by $10 million in federal dollars.
More than 800 public water systems throughout the state could be eligible to receive loans through that program in 1997. A priority system, administered through the Bureau of Health's Drinking Water Program, will identify systems eligible for the first available dollars.

Abstract: The gorilla affair actually reopens the book on animal intelligence in general. The sine qua non of natural science has traditionally been that only humans can think. This no longer seems true. If one denies that gorillas think, then [Binti]'s samaritan act must be attributed to instinct or reflex. But now we can't believe this. We have seen the evidence for ourselves: She carried the boy in a loving fashion to waiting arms rather than swing him about like a rag doll or tear him limb from limb. In Rwanda, by contrast, infants are thrown into the air by soldiers and bayonetted. Perhaps this is why the Binti affair came and went as quickly as it did. The hope was that this story would stir profound and protracted human interest. But no one wanted to think about it too much. It is my opinion that Binti knew exactly what she was doing. Gorillas are territorial, and no doubt her territorial instincts were aroused by the appearance of a human inside her compound. She had a choice, then: Save the child or do it harm. Given the number of human onlookers, she chose wisely. Had she hurt the child in any way, she would have been summarily shot and Descartes would have carried the day.

Full text: Not long ago much was made of the rescue of a 5-year-old boy by a gorilla. The boy had fallen 18 feet into the gorilla pit at an Illinois zoo and was retrieved -- with compassion aforethought -- by a large female, who carried the child with utmost care to anxious zookeepers.
I say much has been made of this. And rightly so. Humans, exhausted from their exertions in Bosnia, Rwanda, and Chechnya, are ready to seize upon any evidence -- no matter how slender the thread -- of humanity in their own species, if only out of nostalgia.
It is ironic that the thread of humanity they have seized upon was presented not by Homo sapiens, but by a near (and, if the DNA technologists have their way, getting nearer) relative, Gorilla gorilla. The event was enough to make a Republican blush with shame. And if Binti (the gorilla's name) sniffs good and hard, she will smell revisionism in the air: These creatures are not so bad after all; perhaps their time line on earth should not be puncutated by the profiteers.
The gorilla affair actually reopens the book on animal intelligence in general. The sine qua non of natural science has traditionally been that only humans can think. This no longer seems true. If one denies that gorillas think, then Binti's samaritan act must be attributed to instinct or reflex. But now we can't believe this. We have seen the evidence for ourselves: She carried the boy in a loving fashion to waiting arms rather than swing him about like a rag doll or tear him limb from limb. In Rwanda, by contrast, infants are thrown into the air by soldiers and bayonetted.
Which are the beasts? The picture grows muddled. Actually, animal behaviorists have suspected for a long while that animals think and that they experience emotions. I once saw a sort of sliding scale in a book, an inclined line illustrating the degree of thought evident in different animal groups. At the top of the grade were humans; slightly below them, the gorillas and chimps; followed by other primates, down through canines, felines, and precipitously bottoming out with lizards, mollusks, and academic trustees.
The advocates of the intellectual life of animals have several darlings among some of the big-brained species -- apes, dolphins, and seals. Each in its way has stirred scientists with its ability to comprehend and, in the case of chmps and gorillas, generate quasi-human language. These latter can't vocalize, but they have been taught to use sign language to get their human keepers to do their bidding.
And yet there is evidence aplenty that bigness of brain has little to do with intelligence. Larger parrots, for example, have walnut-size brains, and yet they have been taught to fabricate whole sentences, and in tones which connote their emotional state at the time. One famous papagei by the name of Alex, upon realizing that his owner was about to leave him at the vet, begged, "Come here. I love you. Wanna go back." It is enough to bring a gentle tear to the cheek of the hardened skeptic.
Interestingly enough, humans of 100,000 years ago already had brains of the present size; brains fully capable of sending a man to the moon or deciphering the genetic code. But they contented themselves with the meanest existence and produced only the crudest stone tools.
So what is it that prevents scientists and interested persons in general from whooping to the cause of animal intelligence? Or rather, who is it? The answer is Descartes, the amateur number jumbler of the 17th century. When he wasn't teaching math to the Queen of Sweden at ungodly hours of the morning, he was forging a philosophy of resistance to the idea that animals can think. For if they could, then they would be entitled to moral rights. At a time when moral rights were already in short supply among humans, so squandering any on animals was not even a consideration.
Perhaps this is why the Binti affair came and went as quickly as it did. The hope was that this story would stir profound and protracted human interest. But no one wanted to think about it too much. It is my opinion that Binti knew exactly what she was doing. Gorillas are territorial, and no doubt her territorial instincts were aroused by the appearance of a human inside her compound. She had a choice, then: Save the child or do it harm. Given the number of human onlookers, she chose wisely. Had she hurt the child in any way, she would have been summarily shot and Descartes would have carried the day.

Abstract: If we read the story carefully, we see that the crime of Sodom was attempted rape, not "sodomy." In only a few scattered passages does the Bible condemn gay sex. Most of those passages are part of a "holiness code" that Christians have considered to be no longer valid. The fundamentalists emphasize parts of the Bible that seem to condemn gays, while they ignore similar passages that say people who work on the Sabbath should be executed, that forbid us to touch the skin of a dead pig (like a football), forbid the eating of shellfish, or forbid us to cut our beards. We must ask, why are only the condemnations of gays to be obeyed, when the rest of the "holiness code" is no longer considered valid?

Full text: There are many churches, and even more interpretations of the Bible. But some people, like Will Nott (Letter, Oct. 1), have a hard time understanding how others could have an interpretation different from their own.
My understanding of the Bible suggests that the command that we love one another is stronger than any possible condemnation of gay sex. There's not much about homosexuality in the Bible, considering how big a book it is. It says much more about love, justice, and compassion than about gay sex. The Ten Commandments never condemn homosexuality, and neither did Jesus. But Jesus did condemn the self-righteous religious leaders who judged and condemned others.
If we read the story carefully, we see that the crime of Sodom was attempted rape, not "sodomy." In only a few scattered passages does the Bible condemn gay sex. Most of those passages are part of a "holiness code" that Christians have considered to be no longer valid. The fundamentalists emphasize parts of the Bible that seem to condemn gays, while they ignore similar passages that say people who work on the Sabbath should be executed, that forbid us to touch the skin of a dead pig (like a football), forbid the eating of shellfish, or forbid us to cut our beards. We must ask, why are only the condemnations of gays to be obeyed, when the rest of the "holiness code" is no longer considered valid?
In the New Testament, only Paul mentions homosexuality. But Paul thought is would be best for everyone to remain celibate. Most of us ignore that recommendation. Jesus said, "judge not, so that you will not be judged." In the Gospels, he mentioned love 47 times, and forgiveness 22 times. We would do well to follow such an example.
It is time to heal the wounds caused by last year's referendum. But now the same people who brought us that divisive referendum are circulating a new petition. They want to outlaw gay marriage, which is already against state and federal law. Another law to outlaw something that's already outlawed, just to stop something that isn't happening! We don't need another divisive referendum. I will decline to sign any such petition.

Full text: PORTLAND -- The ban on any type of fishing in Portland's inner harbor continued Tuesday as a result of the 170,000 gallon oil spill, but the state has lifted a shellfishing ban that covered 80 square miles.
The Department of Marine Resources lifted the shellfishing ban from Cape Elizabeth to the Royal River in Yarmouth Monday as crews continued to clean up the spill.
The shellfishing restrictions were put in place after the tanker Julie N struck the Million Dollar Bridge between Portland and South Portland on Sept. 27, spilling heating oil and bunker fuel that spread up the Fore River to Stroudwater Marsh.
Federal scientists have abandoned the use of a solvent called Corexit to flush oil from the marsh, noting that the solvent had thinned the oil to the point where it could not be recovered.
About 200 workers continued the cleanup Monday.

Penobscot Bay to be probed top to bottom

Author: Bruce Kyle Of the NEWS Staff

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]08 Oct 1996: 1.

Abstract: In the study, which is expected to take several years, scientists will gather information on the bay's depths, makeup of the sea floor, circulation patterns, intertidal habitat, concentrations of chlorophyll, sea temperatures and the land cover of the Penobscot region. That information will be used to improve management of wild fisheries, such as lobster and urchins, to reclaim polluted or depleted clam flats, to restore inshore stocks of cod and haddock and to further develop the aquaculture industry. Organizations joining in the project are the University of Maine Geological Survey, the Bigelow Laboratory for the Ocean Sciences, Maine Maritime Academy, the Maine Office of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), the Department of Marine Resources, the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, which has expertise in satellite mapping and a long-standing relationship with NOAA.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- Gov. Angus King announced Monday the launching of a public-private venture that will give Maine its first up-close and scientific look at the rich yet largely unknown marine environment of Penobscot Bay.
The Penobscot Bay Marine Research Collaborative is funded by a $600,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and administered by the Island Institute.
It will bring together nine research and marine resource organizations for a thorough surface-to-bottom study of the bay that is the critical link between the state's largest upland watershed and the Gulf of Maine.
King said one of his guiding principles in developing environmental policy "has been that we need better science. There have been a number of occasions when we've had to make decisions without data, a leap of faith. This is a major step in getting the data we need to provide a detailed look at what's over, under and in Penobscot Bay."
In the study, which is expected to take several years, scientists will gather information on the bay's depths, makeup of the sea floor, circulation patterns, intertidal habitat, concentrations of chlorophyll, sea temperatures and the land cover of the Penobscot region. That information will be used to improve management of wild fisheries, such as lobster and urchins, to reclaim polluted or depleted clam flats, to restore inshore stocks of cod and haddock and to further develop the aquaculture industry. Organizations joining in the project are the University of Maine Geological Survey, the Bigelow Laboratory for the Ocean Sciences, Maine Maritime Academy, the Maine Office of Geographical Information Systems (GIS), the Department of Marine Resources, the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery, the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, which has expertise in satellite mapping and a long-standing relationship with NOAA.
Stressing that the goal of the study will be practical applications rather than just assembling data, King said the first step in meeting the challenge of economic development in Maine "is to identify our assets, and one of our major assets is the ocean. If we're going to use the ocean to benefit people's lives, we have to know what's out there. This is a crucial step towards making our coast as vital as it once was."
King praised the Island Institute for bringing the project together, saying the Rockland-based private, nonprofit organization "took the lead in developing the kind of public-private partnership we need. This is not a regulatory program in any way -- it's gathering information that will help us make better decisions about Penobscot Bay."
Researchers will use methods that combine satellite, aircraft, shipboard and land-based measurements to produce information and maps of the various layers of the bay. The results will be maintained at the Maine GIS office and will be available to fishermen and all others who use marine resources. Updates on the project will be available on the Internet's World Wide Web via the state of Maine home page.
As an example of the kind of practical applications the study could produce, Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden said that, while fishermen and scientists have had considerable success recently raising cod in hatcheries, "we know very little about releasing them into the wild -- we don't know enough about currents or where there are the proper bottom sediments. With this study, we can look at existing larval cod areas and determine the characteristics that can lead to successful restoration programs." The Penobscot Bay project is the second such effort funded by NOAA, the first being a study of the coast of south Florida.
Bob Feder of NOAA said, while the Florida project focused upon assessing and repairing the damage done to the marine environment by the extensive draining of swamps and development, the Maine study "is geared more toward keeping a relatively healthy ecosystem healthy, of how we can strike a balance between the environment and the economy.
"A tremendous team of public and private organizatins has been put together for this, and the result will be to bring the user of marine resources much closer in to the policy planning process, to create a true feeling of ownership. These people working hand-in-hand will leave something lasting -- a legacy -- to the people of Maine."

Abstract: Cleanup crews continued to remove oil from the waters of Portland Harbor on Sunday, two days after a tanker slammed into a drawbridge, spilling 170,000 gallons of fuel oil. Fishermen, meanwhile, wondered when they could get back to work and how they would be compensated for their losses. George Blake, executive vice president of Maritime Overseas Corp., which owns the tanker, the Julie N, apologized to fishermen "for the destruction this unfortunate accident has caused." He assured that they would be compensated for damage to their boats, gear, and lost income. Fishermen were urged to take claim forms at the meeting. After the crash, 170,000 gallons of heating oil and the boat's own fuel spilled into the Fore River that runs between Portland and South Portland. As of midday Sunday, 300 cleanup workers from up and down the East Coast had recovered about 300,000 gallons of oil and water. Officials refused to speculate on what percentage of the spilled fuel had been recovered.

Full text: PORTLAND -- Cleanup crews continued to remove oil from the waters of Portland Harbor on Sunday, two days after a tanker slammed into a drawbridge, spilling 170,000 gallons of fuel oil. Fishermen, meanwhile, wondered when they could get back to work and how they would be compensated for their losses.
Portland Harbor remained closed, but the Coast Guard said it would allow small commercial vessels to come and go as long as they called in their plans first.
"We don't want to impede the commercial fishing industry," Coast Guard Cmdr. Burt Russell said to more than 200 fishermen who turned out for a meeting Sunday afternoon.
But Eugene Bellanceau, a lobsterman from Windham, said his son couldn't even use their boat if he wanted to: It's covered in thick, black oil.
"Our boat was white, but it's black now," he told officials. "We set 300 lobster traps a year and now we can't set any."
Bellanceau and other fishermen with oiled boats, were urged not to use their vessels, because it would just create small oil slicks.
George Blake, executive vice president of Maritime Overseas Corp., which owns the tanker, the Julie N, apologized to fishermen "for the destruction this unfortunate accident has caused." He assured that they would be compensated for damage to their boats, gear, and lost income. Fishermen were urged to take claim forms at the meeting.
"We do recognize the financial impact on you and the fisheries. We intend to deal fairly with you," he said.
The Department of Marine Resources has issued a ban on fishing, lobstering and shellfish harvesting. The ban on shellfish -- clams and mussels -- extends as far east as Harpswell.
Pete McAleney, owner of New Meadows Lobster in Portland, was concerned about the immediate impact to the fisheries, but also the long-term reputation of Casco Bay lobster.
"If they smell like oil we'll refuse them," he said. "I'm not taking a chance by selling contaminated lobster."
McAleney, a wholesale dealer, buys about 25,000 pounds of lobster a day. Lately, he hasn't bought any.
"The protection of the marine environment remains our number one priority," said Cmdr. Russel "A great deal of people remain actively involved in this extensive recovery operation."
Containment and cleanup efforts started shortly after the Liberian-flagged tanker hit the Million Dollar Bridge on Friday morning, tearing a 30-foot gash in the ship's hull and damaging the quarter-mile drawbridge.
After the crash, 170,000 gallons of heating oil and the boat's own fuel spilled into the Fore River that runs between Portland and South Portland. As of midday Sunday, 300 cleanup workers from up and down the East Coast had recovered about 300,000 gallons of oil and water. Officials refused to speculate on what percentage of the spilled fuel had been recovered.
Four miles of containment boom snaked around the 560-foot Julie N, which remained docked at a terminal about a mile upriver from the damaged bridge.
Workers from federal and state wildlife agencies searched for birds injured by the oil. About a dozen birds were being treated by wildlife rehabilitators at an emergency center at the South Portland Armory. The Marine Animal Rescue Unit, which is affiliated with the New England Aquarium, surveyed the harbor for seals affected by the spill.
Lois Winter, of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said eight seals were spotted Sunday swimming in oil-slicked waters. Winter said that when oil gets into their fur, the seals can lose buoyancy, lose insulation and suffer hypothermia. Clumps of fur may also fall out.
The seals did not appear distressed, but Winter said it takes several days for the oil to affect the mammals.
The Million Dollar Bridge, meanwhile, remained closed to traffic Sunday, but operators were able to lower and raise the drawbridge. The Maine Sunday Telegram reported that the 80-year-old bridge may have moved about 2 inches when the boat hit, and engineers were uncertain whether the two spans would align when the drawbridge was closed.
The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the crash but said it could be months before a cause is released. A local harbor pilot was on the tanker's bridge when the ship, which is 10 feet narrower than the 95-foot opening in the drawbridge, hit the bridge on one side then bounced to the other side.

Abstract: Before 1994, Massachusetts had always taken first place. "Maine has better fish populations and has historically promoted diversification," [Jon Gibson] said, adding that Maine fishermen harvested 57 different species last year. "Maine is somewhat fortunate in that regard," Gibson said. "Many of the species are located mostly in the Gulf of Maine and not so much in the south." According to the National Marine Fisheries Services, commercial fisheries in the Northeast Region, which stretches from Virginia to Maine, brought in $983.1 million in revenue, with Maine topping the list.

Full text: PORTLAND -- Fishermen along the Eastern Seaboard sold their catch for more money in 1995 than in the previous year, despite the dramatic decline of New England groundfish and the Chesapeake Bay's eastern oyster, federal officials said Tuesday.
Revenue from commercial fisheries last year totaled $983 million, with Maine leading the 10-state region with $273.6 million, and Massachusetts following with $216.3 million, said Jon Gibson, spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
The total revenue for the area stretching from Maine to Virginia increased by 8 percent compared to 1994 and 11 percent over 1993.
Maine fishermen outsold their counterparts for the second year in a row by relying on their trademark lobster and diversifying their catch with high-value species such as sea urchin, shrimp and farmed Atlantic salmon.
Before 1994, Massachusetts had always taken first place. "Maine has better fish populations and has historically promoted diversification," Gibson said, adding that Maine fishermen harvested 57 different species last year.
"Maine is somewhat fortunate in that regard," Gibson said. "Many of the species are located mostly in the Gulf of Maine and not so much in the south."
Of all the fisheries, lobster was the moneymaker. New England harvested 66.1 million pounds of lobster in 1995 worth $206.6 million -- a 29 percent increase since 1993.
"In terms of value, lobsters are what carry the industry," Gibson said.
Sea scollops followed with 17 million pounds for $89 million, and blue crab collected $75 million. Others topping the list were the Atlantic salmon, menhaden, the surf clam, northern quahog and the sea urchin.
"What we have seen over the long haul is the decline in the importance of the actual fish species and an increase in the nonfish, like the bivalve, mollusks and crustaceans," Gibson said. Every state in the region, with the exception of Rhode Island and New Jersey, showed increased revenue over the 1993-1995 period. Delaware fishermen brought in the least money at $9 million.
Virginia's revenue increased the most -- 69 percent -- between 1993 and 1995, thanks to the harvest of more than 752 million pounds of menhaden, an industrial fish used in fish meal and fish oil, Gibson said.
But Virginia -- ranking third with $111.2 million in revenue -- and surrounding states also suffered with the collapse of the pricey eastern oyster, found in the Chesapeake Bay. Revenue from oyster decreased by 84 percent since 1993 because of two oyster diseases, MSK and Dermo. Fishermen harvested 9.2 million pounds worth $35.9 million in 1993, and only 1.8 million pounds in 1995 worth $5.8 million dollars.
"The eastern oyster is to that part of the country as the groundfish are to this part of the country," said Gibson in Woods Hole, Mass. "The difference is we haven't seen such a sharp decline so quickly. It's been gradual here."
Stocks of New England groundfish have been dropping since 1980, and are now at an all-time low, primarily because of overfishing. The Northeast's three traditional groundfish species -- cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder -- collectively accounted for revenue of $35.8 million in 1995, a 38 percent decrease since 1993. Groundfish now account for less than 4 percent of the region's earnings.
But while fishing revenues have increased overall, don't quit that day job to lead the seemingly romantic life of a lobsterman or fisherman.
The fishing industry is generally not a growing business. "It's still a hard way to make a living," said urchin diver Jim Bolen of Friendship. "It's getting scary enough that anyone else who has something to do should look at that to cover their butt."

Cleaner water may be helping clam flats

Author: The Associated Press

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]20 Aug 1996: 1.

Abstract: Shellfish officials in Freeport plan to open the last 200 acres of clam flats closed by old household sewage systems. Areas in Harpswell and Phippsburg and Wiscasset have also been approved for clamming. And about 1,000 acres of mudflats near Rockland were opened recently because of a new sewage treatment plant on the St. George River. In 1991, when Mick McGivaren began sampling the water in the Harraseeket River in Freeport, 70 percent of the flats were closed. Now -- after those last 200 acres are opened -- 98 percent of the flats will be deemed safe for digging.

Full text: FREEPORT -- Cove by cove, stretches of previously closed clam flats in Maine have become open to diggers in recent years. Some say it's a sign of cleaner water.
In Casco Bay, in 1993, 44.5 percent of the bay's flats were closed. By 1995, the percentage of closed flats had dropped to 37 percent.
"What it means to me is progress and success and I hope that percentage closed continues to decline," said Paul Anderson, director of the shellfish sanitation program for the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Shellfish officials in Freeport plan to open the last 200 acres of clam flats closed by old household sewage systems. Areas in Harpswell and Phippsburg and Wiscasset have also been approved for clamming. And about 1,000 acres of mudflats near Rockland were opened recently because of a new sewage treatment plant on the St. George River.
The ratio of open to closed clam flats is considered an environmental benchmark of how clean the water is.
In the late 1980s, the federal government began using stricter criteria for classifying shellfish areas. Those changes were so severe that many states had to close areas and put in new programs, said Anderson.
"Now, what we're seeing is the fruits of our labors. Our databases are flush with water quality data," he said.
In 1991, when Mick McGivaren began sampling the water in the Harraseeket River in Freeport, 70 percent of the flats were closed. Now -- after those last 200 acres are opened -- 98 percent of the flats will be deemed safe for digging.
"I'm seeing cleaner waters," said McGivaren. "Everybody's much more sensitive to the cleanliness of our waters and our shores."
But, while agreeing that the numbers indicate progress on the environmental front, others cautioned that there are other reasons for clam flats re-opening and there's still more to do to decrease pollution.

Casco Bay caterpillars target of spray bid Insect causing reactions in islanders, survey says

Author: The Associated Press

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]15 Aug 1996: 1.

Abstract: Survey results will go to the state Board of Pesticide Control and state legislators from the area, said George Flaherty, Portland's manager for island affairs. City officials hope that if they can prove the caterpillars are a health threat, Portland will get state permission for wider spraying of the pesticide Dimilin. In May, with property owners' permission, the city hired a crop-duster to spray the pesticide over parts of Peaks, Great Diamond and Cushing islands. The same contractor sprayed two privately owned islands, Clapboard and Sturdivant, and parts of Falmouth on the mainland.

Full text: PORTLAND -- Officials are hoping a new survey detailing health problems caused by the browntail moth caterpillar on Portland's Casco Bay islands will persuade the state to use more pesticides to get rid of them.
The survey conducted this summer shows that 84 percent of those responding suffered skin rashes as a result of the tiny hairs on the caterpillars. Twenty-one percent said they had respiratory problems.
Survey results will go to the state Board of Pesticide Control and state legislators from the area, said George Flaherty, Portland's manager for island affairs. City officials hope that if they can prove the caterpillars are a health threat, Portland will get state permission for wider spraying of the pesticide Dimilin.
In May, with property owners' permission, the city hired a crop-duster to spray the pesticide over parts of Peaks, Great Diamond and Cushing islands. The same contractor sprayed two privately owned islands, Clapboard and Sturdivant, and parts of Falmouth on the mainland.
Dimilin is considered harmless to humans and other mammals, birds and fish. But some island residents, particularly on Peaks, oppose its use because it can harm lobsters and other shellfish, and because its long-term effects on health and the environment are unknown.
Because of the opposition on Peaks Island -- the bay's most populous island -- only the island's southwest corner was sprayed. That ensured that the pesticide could not drift onto properties where owners didn't want it.
Residents in areas that weren't sprayed have continued to suffer from the caterpillars this summer.
The respiratory problems and rashes occur principally in June and July, when the caterpillars mature.
The caterpillar hairs carry a toxin that has plagued islanders each summer for at least two years. The hairs get airborne and either drift against exposed skin or fall on items that people handle.
Some people react so violently to the caterpillar toxin that hospital emergency treatment, or prescription steroids, has been necessary.

First Class Act Postmaster makes Cranberry Island center of far-flung community

Abstract: Behind the scenes, busily sorting the day's mail, is Islesford Postmaster Joy Sprague. Sporting burgundy-red nails and a black "Sting" cap acquired at a recent concert of her favorite rock star, she cuts a flamboyant figure compared with most postal workers clad in official pinstriped shirts and blue pants. Speaking from Boston, U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman Alicia Gamow says the phenomenal growth in sales and revenue of the Islesford post office's Stamps by Mail service is proof Sprague's novel approach works. The daughter of an Islesford lobsterman who died at sea, Sprague has spent most of her life on Little Cranberry. A single mother with two daughters, she has been postmaster for nearly two decades. As a teen, she began working at the post office as a leave replacement. She became the youngest postmaster in the United States when she took over that job at the age of 20.

Full text: CRANBERRY ISLES -- These summer days, Beal & Bunker's mailboat, Sea Queen, makes a 10 a.m. run to Little Cranberry Island about three miles off Mount Desert Island. Coarse canvas sacks stamped "U.S. Mail," along with crates of milk and other freight, are lifted off the boat onto a pickup truck waiting on the pier.
Loaded to the gunwales, the battered, black Toyota trundles up the road, past pink rugosa rosebushes and piles of green-wire lobster traps speckled with barnacles, to the Islesford Market in Little Cranberry's village, where the village post office is housed.
Literally a hole in the wall, the tiny post office occupies a corner of the store. Its window is framed by dozens of old metal mailboxes. Islanders young and old cluster around it. They chat and check out their boxes, anticipating the appearance of a letter.
Mail time is the high point of daily life in Islesford. Summer or winter, the ritual of going to the store and fetching the mail brings people out of their homes, binding together this small island community that boasts about 82 winter inhabitants and scores more summer people.
Behind the scenes, busily sorting the day's mail, is Islesford Postmaster Joy Sprague. Sporting burgundy-red nails and a black "Sting" cap acquired at a recent concert of her favorite rock star, she cuts a flamboyant figure compared with most postal workers clad in official pinstriped shirts and blue pants.
While black boxes on post office counters across the United States display postal transactions, the blue-eyed postmaster's radiant smile and friendly manner -- her personal touch -- have hundreds of people ordering postage stamps through the mail from her tiny Maine post office. She has filled orders from all over the United States and the globe, including Mexico, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Puerto Rico and the Fiji Islands.
The U.S. Postal Service's "Stamps By Mail" program enables customers to order their postage stamps through the mail to avoid standing in line and other inconveniences. Orders are filled and returned postage-free.
Over the past decade, the Islesford post office's annual revenue from the Stamps By Mail service has skyrocketed. In the late 1980s, annual sales topped only a couple thousand dollars.
This year, they've hit $59,000. And that's not counting earnings over the next two months before fiscal 1996 ends.
The Islesford post office now ranks No. 1 in Maine for mail-order stamp sales.
Strangely enough, most of the Islesford postmaster's Stamps By Mail customers have never met her in person, nor have they ever set foot on Little Cranberry. But they know all about the church fair, the masquerade ball, the Christmas pageant, the Wits and Nitwits variety show and other happenings on the island.
Homespun approach
For years now, Sprague has enclosed with each stamp order a rambling, personal letter, handwritten in her unmistakable curlicue cursive, and a color snapshot of sea smoke swirling in the harbor, a double rainbow over a beach or another island scene.
In one letter last December, she described a winter solstice celebration on the island:
"At the coast guard beach, many came and gathered around a blazing bonfire. Enjoying music on tape by Paul Winter, we also made several six-foot-tall snowmen complete with kelp tongues," she wrote. "Snow clouds slowly made their way south, leaving behind a crystal-clear midnight sky pierced with diamond-like stars. The longest night of the year is tucked behind us."
Speaking from Boston, U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman Alicia Gamow says the phenomenal growth in sales and revenue of the Islesford post office's Stamps by Mail service is proof Sprague's novel approach works.
"Joy is really enthusiastic and puts her whole heart into whatever she does," Gamow says, recalling how Sprague once skipped rope to work as part of the Portland post office's commute-another-way program.
The Islesford post office's success comes at a time when other small post offices in Maine and across the nation have either shut down or are threatened with closure. A century ago, just about every Maine village boasted its own post office, but today only about 444 remain.
Another world
Born and raised in Islesford, Sprague says the post office and general store are the heart of the island. She and storekeeper Susie "Soos" Krasnow seem like soul sisters. Between them, the two women have created a unique, homey atmosphere.
"We offer the community a place where you can feel comfortable hauling up a chair, having a cup of coffee and joking around,"
Sprague says.
Walking into the old, red-shingled building housing the store and post office is like stepping into another time, a surreal world, or onto the set of a TV sitcom. A black-spotted plastic cow dangles from the ceiling. A gigantic poster of Marilyn Monroe adorns the wall. A pink satin ballet slipper and a necklace of bleached whelks and periwinkle shells hang beside mailboxes. A bouquet of pink lilies and carnations graces the post office counter.
In the store section, an older gentleman has fallen asleep in a wicker chair. Oblivious to the din, he has been napping for about half an hour while his sister shops and chit-chats. A dollhouse stands in between a mink teddy bear, Quaker Oats and Chinese sweet and sour sauce on the shelves. A xylophone and children's books are tucked beneath Oysterettes, Wheat Thins and other crackers. A striped, tail-less Manx cat prowls the aisle.
The daughter of an Islesford lobsterman who died at sea, Sprague has spent most of her life on Little Cranberry. A single mother with two daughters, she has been postmaster for nearly two decades. As a teen, she began working at the post office as a leave replacement. She became the youngest postmaster in the United States when she took over that job at the age of 20.
Home to far-flung community
More than five years ago, Sprague decided some ceremony was in order when a year-round resident became her 100th sender of the U.S. Postal Service's overnight and special delivery service, Express Mail. She presented a homemade batch of brownies to the customer.
But brownies just didn't seem enough fanfare.
"I thought of cream puffs," says Sprague, whose mother makes the decadent treats for the church fair and Saturday night bean suppers. "They just look like a party."
The postmaster began awarding cream puffs to every 25th Express Mail sender, establishing a tradition that has snowballed. The luscious sweets, with chocolate tumbling down the sides, weigh about 7 ounces apiece on the mail scale. Senders are photographed with their treats. Dubbed "The Cream Puff Hall of Fame," the photos hang on the post office wall.
Sprague credits Great Cranberry Island Postmaster Leigh Liebow with giving her the idea of writing a personal letter to Stamps By Mail customers. She says Liebow sends a friendly note to summer residents in the fall, reminding them to order their Christmas stamps.
The Islesford postmaster expanded on the idea, enclosing a personal letter and photo with each stamp order. She keeps a wide selection of stamps on hand, tailoring orders to her customers'
tastes.
For instance, a New York City resident once requested stamps to match her purple stationery. She received the abolitionist Harriet Tubman stamp and others containing purple, lilac, lavender and violet hues.
Or there's the artist in Reno, Nev. He told the postmaster he likes "things and pretty women." These days, she has been sending him Marilyn Monroe and antique car stamps.
Initially, Sprague's mail-order stamp customers were mostly summer people longing for Islesford. But news of the folksy letter, scenic photo and customized service spread. Pretty soon, strangers were placing orders.
Besides keeping the post office and her job intact, the island postmaster says it has been personally rewarding to connect with so many people. She says her customers treat her like a family friend, sending photos of weddings and other milestones in their lives. She says some appear at the post office and introduce themselves.
One California customer has proposed to her twice in person.
"He says, `Will you marry me, Joy?"' says Sprague, who is holding out for Sting. "He has done it twice now."
Just the other day, she received a card from John and Pauline Dullanty of Cambridge, Mass. The couple enclosed photos of themelves.
"We are watching the Olympics and thought of writing a note to our gold medal member of the U.S. Postal Service to say `thank you' for all the nice things you do for all your loyal followers," the Dullantys wrote. "Roses are red. Violets are blue. It's really a pleasure to send our thanks to you."
There are the two Dominican nuns in Detroit, Mich. They planned to visit Islesford, but one of them is battling cancer.
"She is being very courageous about it," Sprague says. "The therapy seems to be going well."
Or there's the fellow at the North Hampton County offices in Easton, Pa. Learning of Sprague's black standard poodle, Hemingway, he sent the canine a box of dog biscuits.
"He said, `Give the mutt a hug,"' she says, chuckling.
What is it about Sprague and the island that is attractive? The way she explains it, it sounds like the mystique surrounding Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon.
"I think it's the fact it's an island and the unique way of life that people find hard to imagine -- like being at the end of the dock with two weeks' worth of groceries and a nor'easter blowing." The postmaster muses. "I think people in America want that connection of a small community. They want to look {at} and feel a time that's being lost in this country."
Islesford summer resident Sarah Corson is among the postmaster's devotees. She loves to juxtapose stamps of jazz musician Louis Armstrong and Impressionist painter Mary Cassatt.
"I place her ear just above his trumpet," she says.
Corson says Sprague's stamps, letters and photos provide her with a spiritual link to Islesford during the winter. But she adds that the postmaster's joyful outlook is uplifting.
"She creates an atmosphere in which other people want to give," she reflects, noting that her husband has been known to play his accordion on the store's steps. "Joy is a metaphor for possibility."

Abstract: During the past 10 years, the hatchery has produced an annual average of 12 million half-inch soft-shell clams for stock enhancement purposes. Clams have been seeded on intertidal flats in 25 of the 45 coastal communities that have shellfish management programs. Hatchery-reared seeds have been planted in flats as far south as Kittery and as far east as Eastport.

Full text: BEALS ISLAND -- The State Planning Office has awarded a $35,000 Coast Program grant to the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery, said Evan D. Richert, director of the office.
The grant is part of the office's "Investing in Washington County" initiative, a partnership with county residents to identify the most promising economic sectors and make state investments in them.
The grant will be used toward increased production of soft-shell seed clams; a shoreline survey of Cobscook Bay; and to improve communication between the clam hatchery and county communities regarding stock enhancement and water quality problems.
The grant also will fund several research projects on clams.
The Beals Island hatchery was established in 1987 and until 1995 was administered by the University of Maine at Machias, which also provided technical assistance and limited financial aid.
In January 1996, the hatchery program began its 10th year with a new administrative partner, a 16-member board of directors made up of individuals from academia, government, finance, business and industry.
During the past 10 years, the hatchery has produced an annual average of 12 million half-inch soft-shell clams for stock enhancement purposes. Clams have been seeded on intertidal flats in 25 of the 45 coastal communities that have shellfish management programs. Hatchery-reared seeds have been planted in flats as far south as Kittery and as far east as Eastport.
There have been technical advances in nursery and field grow-out phases of the program including the development of methods of overwintering clams -- rather than seeding flats in the fall -- that alter first winter survival rates from less than 20 percent to greater than 85 percent; and the discovery, through field experimentation, of factors that enhance growth and survival, such as the appropriate time of year to plant, optimal stocking densities, appropriate seeding areas, and the type of protective netting to use to deter predators.

Shellfish market in clampdown Dealers, diggers, eateries feel pinch of flat closings

Abstract: As the summer tourism season peaks, shellfish flats from Portland to Matinicus Island -- the heaviest producers of clams and other shellfish -- were still closed this weekend to harvesters because of health concerns. Diggers remained idle, forcing some restaurants and fresh seafood markets to take steamers off their menus or go digging into the Canadian markets to bring steamers to their customers. Wholesale prices are expected to go up even when the ban is lifted and the supplies of clams recover. Before the ban, clams cost The Lobster Pound Restaurant in Lincolnville Beach about $75 per bushel; now they cost about $80. A restaurant official expects prices to increase by $10 per bushel or more once the ban is lifted because it is peak season. Whether it was helping the restaurant or hurting it, demand for the steamers has been down since the ban was put into effect. Some customers are hesitant to order clams in light of the ban, [Peter McLaughlin] said, although the restaurant only buys clams that are certified. Normally the restaurant sells about 40 bushels of steamed and fried clams during the week, but because of the ban it sold about six or seven bushels fewer than normal last week.

Full text: Tropical Storm Bertha and subsequent rainstorms may have soaked much of the state, but they have left many clam diggers and dealers high and dry.
As the summer tourism season peaks, shellfish flats from Portland to Matinicus Island -- the heaviest producers of clams and other shellfish -- were still closed this weekend to harvesters because of health concerns. Diggers remained idle, forcing some restaurants and fresh seafood markets to take steamers off their menus or go digging into the Canadian markets to bring steamers to their customers.
The July 14 ban on digging for clams, mussels, quahogs and oysters was partially lifted last week and is expected to be lifted for most of the remainder of the state today as conditions have improved, said Paul Anderson, director of the Shellfish Sanitation Program for the state.
The ban was withdrawn for flats east of the Penobscot River and west of Cape Elizabeth Thursday, a few days after the ban went into effect. This left the restriction in place for flats from Portland Head Light to Matinicus Island as well as some more sensitive areas such as theBagaduce and Scarborough rivers and their estuaries.
Anderson said although much of the state's flats will no longer be restricted, some areas more sensitive to pollution, such as the Kennebec River region and the Medomak River region, may remain restricted areas for a few more days.
State authorities instituted the ban in the wake of Bertha, which dumped nearly a half-foot of rain in some areas. As a result, water bacteria surged above acceptable levels as some sewage treatment plants were pushed beyond capacity and overflowed into rivers that feed into the ocean.
"Obviously we want to open them as quick as possible within the boundaries of prudent public health," said Robin Alden, commissioner for Marine Resources.
Such flooding and subsequent bans aren't unusual. It's just the timing of this one that is drawing attention and concern in the state. Most bans in the past have occurred following springtime thaws and floods. This ban is hitting home for Mainers who rely on tourists' appetites for the shellfish.
"It's been real hard on both of us, dealers and diggers," said Roger Feltis, who not only harvests clams but also serves as a dealer, brokering them to local markets and into other states, like Massachusetts, where the clams can fetch higher prices.
Feltis, who operates Roger Seafood in Waldoboro, said prices diggers are getting for shellfish like clams were already abnormally low -- about $50 per bushel -- compared with several years ago when they were about $80 per bushel at this point in the year. Now, diggers will have to scramble to make up the lost time or lose a week in the clamming season that closes in the early fall.
Wholesale prices are expected to go up even when the ban is lifted and the supplies of clams recover. Before the ban, clams cost The Lobster Pound Restaurant in Lincolnville Beach about $75 per bushel; now they cost about $80. A restaurant official expects prices to increase by $10 per bushel or more once the ban is lifted because it is peak season.
But for some businesses still without clams, speculation about prices is premature.
At Jess's Market on South Main Street in Rockland, fresh whole clams for steaming are usually a big seller. With the ban still in effect, Jess Wiggin, the market's owner, is coming up empty-handed for the steamers. That means fewer sales and fewer customers coming in.
The only clams in the store are the deeper-water variety, the Mahogany clams or those found in cans on the store's shelves.
Wiggin, a certified seafood dealer, has erased the price of clams on the billboard in front of his store.
Wiggin had thought he was prepared for Bertha's repercussions. He had stocked up on clams and oysters before the storms hit.
"You have to think ahead in the seafood business," he said in his still-busy market.
Wiggin bought 30 bushels of the clams, three times what he'd normally pick up. The clams didn't last and by about midweek last week, he ran out.
At the Landing Restaurant in Rockland, with no steamers available, the chefs and cooks were busy preparing shrimp coctail as an appetizer for customers who had a yearning for seafood.
Up the coast from Rockland at Lincolnville Beach, however, steamers were available at the Lobster Pound Restaurant. But Executive Chef and Vice President Peter McLaughlin had to tap markets in Canada to get these steamers, and supplies were running low. McLaughlin estimated the restaurant had enough steamers to last through the weekend and perhaps into the early part of the week.
Whether it was helping the restaurant or hurting it, demand for the steamers has been down since the ban was put into effect. Some customers are hesitant to order clams in light of the ban, McLaughlin said, although the restaurant only buys clams that are certified. Normally the restaurant sells about 40 bushels of steamed and fried clams during the week, but because of the ban it sold about six or seven bushels fewer than normal last week.
McLaughlin looks at the ban as part of the price to be paid for doing business in Maine.
"It's normal," he said. "It's a given that the state is going to shut it down."

Abstract: Last weekend's torrential rains prompted the DMR Sunday to close the entire Maine coast to shellfish harvesting after the heavy rains caused some sewer treatment plants to overflow and discharge raw sewage into the sea. The emergency action followed the deluge that began Saturday. In a 24-hour period, Belfast got 5.5 inches of rainfall, while Ellsworth received 3 inches.

Full text: Clam diggers as well as tourists and Mainers hankering for steamers or a basket of fried clams will be relieved to hear the ban on shellfish harvesting has been lifted in two sections of the Maine coast.
The Maine Department of Marine Resources Thursday removed the prohibition on harvesting clams, mussels, quahogs and oysters east of the Penobscot River and west of Cape Elizabeth.
Harvesting is still barred in a section of coastline stretching from the Portland Head Light to Matinicus Island as well as the Bagaduce and Scarboro rivers and their estuaries.
The DMR's water quality specialists have been out taking water samples to ensure coastal flats that previously had been open to harvesting are not polluted following the recent spell of heavy rainfall.
"We've found the water quality is clean enough to warrant an opening," David Dennison, a water quality specialist at the DMR's Lamoine laboratory, reported Thursday.

The emergency action followed the deluge that began Saturday. In a 24-hour period, Belfast got 5.5 inches of rainfall, while Ellsworth received 3 inches.
DMR officials say such closures are not uncommon. They say the closures are usually imposed when rainfall is heavy in the fall, early spring or in the aftermath of a hurricane. One such shellfish harvesting ban occurred last year and another early this past spring.

Abstract: State marine resource officials banned shellfish harvesting along the Maine coast Sunday after heavy weekend rains caused some sewage treatment plants to overflow and discharge raw sewage into the sea. The Department of Marine Resources indefinitely prohibited all forms of harvesting clams, mussels, quahogs and oysters. The prohibition could last up to a week, said David Dennison, a DMR water quality specialist at the department's Lamoine laboratory. Maine Shellfish in Ellsworth supplies clams, mussels, quahogs and other shellfish to hundreds of stores, restaurants and other businesses and institutions around Maine. Plant Manager Stephen Beathem said such closures can have far-reaching effects on business.

Full text: State marine resource officials banned shellfish harvesting along the Maine coast Sunday after heavy weekend rains caused some sewage treatment plants to overflow and discharge raw sewage into the sea.
The Department of Marine Resources indefinitely prohibited all forms of harvesting clams, mussels, quahogs and oysters. The prohibition could last up to a week, said David Dennison, a DMR water quality specialist at the department's Lamoine laboratory.
The DMR took the emergency action following the torrential rains that began Saturday. Within a 24-hour period, Belfast got 5.5 inches of rain and Ellsworth got 3 inches, said Dennison.
"This is greatly in excess of the normal rainfall," he said. "Such a heavy inflow of water can cause sewage treatment plants to overflow and directly discharge fecal matter into the ocean."
Castine, Machias, Yarmouth and Thomaston were among the coastal communities where treatment plants overflowed, according to the DMR.
Paul Anderson, head of the DMR's shellfish sanitation program, said the closure is a precautionary measure until his department's water quality specialists are able to take water samples and ensure that coastal flats previously open to harvesting are not polluted.
Anderson said such closures are not uncommon. He said they usually are imposed when rainfall is heavy in the fall, early spring or in the aftermath of a hurricane. He said one such shellfish harvesting ban occurred last year and another early this spring.
The closure comes at a time of the summer when millions of visitors pour into the state to sample "steamers" and other traditional Maine fare.
Maine Shellfish in Ellsworth supplies clams, mussels, quahogs and other shellfish to hundreds of stores, restaurants and other businesses and institutions around Maine. Plant Manager Stephen Beathem said such closures can have far-reaching effects on business.
"It shortens up your supply and drives prices really high," he said Monday. "Course, you have a certain amount on hand but that can run out."
Josette Pettegrow runs the 40-year-old Trenton Lobster Pound just before the Thompson Island Bridge linking the mainland and Mount Desert Island. She recalled one year when the flats were closed for most of the season.
"Right now, it doesn't have much impact on us. We had a {refrigerated} supply prior to the closure," she said Monday. "I feel much better having the closure than having someone get sick."

Abstract: BEALS ISLAND--By the time the dishes are cleared from Maine's annual 40-million pound lobster feed, we Americans have gobbled, slurped and splashed our way through about 20 million pounds of the ultimate white meat, succulent and butter-drenched.

Full text:   BEALS ISLAND--By the time the dishes are cleared from Maine's annual 40-million pound lobster feed, we Americans have gobbled, slurped and splashed our way through about 20 million pounds of the ultimate white meat, succulent and butter-drenched. That's the good part.
Rotting out on the national back porch is a mammoth 10,000-ton trash bag- of stink-to-high-heaven lobster shells, bodies and goop--garbage so foul we swear next year we'll order out pizza.
Down on Beals Island, generations-old Carver Shellfish Inc. is working to bring some modern table manners to the business, first by having launched a quick-frozen tail and claw line, which could send the lobster bib to the ash bin of history, and now by developing a process to turn every scrap of waste into something useful.
"We've been working for four years to add as much value as possible to lobster, to move away from merely selling an unimproved natural resource," says Raoul Pelletier, a career veteran of the food-processing industry who heads up the waste-recovery project. "The first phase was the frozen product, which we believe is every bit as good as fresh in taste and texture and vastly superior in consistency. The second phase we're in now is to recover value from the waste, to turn what has been a major liability for the industry into an asset."
The waste recovery project is funded in part by a $37,500 Fishing Industry Grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce through a program to help the industry develop new products and markets.
The heart of the project is a machine adapted from the poultry industry that separates lobster waste into two components: a meat paste and a ground powder of shell and fiber.
The paste, an orange pate, can be used as the base for soups, sauces, salad dressings, stuffings, perhaps even lobster burgers. Carver's will be working with the University of Maine Food Science Department this year to develop marketable products and to conduct taste-test focus groups.
The shell and fiber powder has been chemically analyzed and found to have great potential as a nutrient-rich additive to high-quality fertilizer and to feed for the salmon aquaculture industry.
"None of this is totally new," Pelletier said. "The Canadians have been extracting paste for years, the shells and bodies have been composted, but we're trying to take it to a level where one day the lobster industry will be waste free, where, instead of paying a composter to haul off our waste, we have a valuable product to sell."
The Maine lobster industry is riding high on several consecutive years of record harvests in the 40-million pound range, but Pelletier, like many, believes a drop back to the traditional harvests of 20 to 25-million pounds is inevitable.
"We're dealing with Mother Nature here, with cycles we cannot control," he said. "Right now, the predators of young lobsters--such as cod and haddock--are in decline, so the lobster population is up. When the predators come back, lobster will level off. When that happens, lobstermen will really see the benefits of adding more value to the product.
"I've worked in virtually every part of the food industry--candy, produce, fish, poultry--and this is the key everywhere: extract the maximum out of your raw material, turn what you've been throwing away into a product with value."
Only about 8 to 10 percent of Maine lobsters are processed, with the bulk going to the live market. Brent Beal, plant manager of Carver's Island Maid brand frozen shellfish line, says overcoming the public belief that the only good lobster is a live lobster will take time and an industry dedicated to quality.
"Anyone who buys live lobster knows what happens--you get one that's perfect, one that's tough as leather and one that's mush," Beal said. "With our quick-freeze process and quality control, the inferior lobsters never make it to market, the customer never gets a bad lobster. Our packaging has five layers of protection. We run abuse tests. We constantly evaluate quality. Right now, we're up to an 18-month shelf life with no loss of quality."
Carver's spotless processing plant produced about 800,000 pounds of cryogenically frozen lobster product last year and is aiming for a million this year, nearly all going to restaurants and hotels. About three-fourths of the product is raw green tails and the rest pre-cooked claws.
"The big surprise has been the claws," Beal said. "We sold 200,000 pounds last year and could have sold twice that if we'd had it. The Las Vegas casinos love them. We score the shell so you can just snap it open. They make great finger food."
While 40 million pounds of lobster worth more than $100 million is a pretty big deal down on the docks, Pelletier says lobstermen need to take a closer look at how they fit into the big food-industry picture.
"In the food business, 40 million pounds is nothing. Americans eat 40 million pounds of candy a day," he said. "The lobster industy has been under this terrible disadvantage of having to sell a live product. Imagine what would happen to the poultry industry if people suddenly thought they had to bring live chickens home from the store.
"Every sector of the food industry has the same challenge--deliver a product that is high quality, consistent and convenient and cut your waste to the absolute minimum. If you don't use it, you lose it

Manatee deaths blamed on red tide Scientists had feared infectious disease

Abstract: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- An unusual outbreak of red tide was to blame for the mysterious deaths of a record number of manatees this spring, scientists said Tuesday. Red tide is a toxic micro-organism that accumulates in shellfish. When the manatee deaths began in March, the red tide bloom was the worst it had been at that time of year since 1982, when a similar manatee die-off took place. Initially, scientists said red tide wasn't to blame because the pace of deaths was too quick and no sick or disoriented animals had been found, said Scott Wright, chief scientist for the Department of Environmental Protection.

Full text: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- An unusual outbreak of red tide was to blame for the mysterious deaths of a record number of manatees this spring, scientists said Tuesday.
The finding is good news since it means the deaths weren't caused by an infectious disease that manatees could spread among themselves or carry to other areas. But it's bad news, scientists say, because there's no way to prevent it from happening again.
"These are natural occurrences," said Thierry Work, a scientist from the National Wildlife Health Center. "Large numbers of animals die but we can't control it. You can't stop a volcano."
Red tide is a toxic micro-organism that accumulates in shellfish. When the manatee deaths began in March, the red tide bloom was the worst it had been at that time of year since 1982, when a similar manatee die-off took place.
Between March 5 and April 27, 158 of the whiskered walrus-like animals in southwest Florida died, pushing the total deaths for the year to 304 -- a grim record. The previous record was set in 1990 when 206 manatees died.
Initially, scientists said red tide wasn't to blame because the pace of deaths was too quick and no sick or disoriented animals had been found, said Scott Wright, chief scientist for the Department of Environmental Protection.
Scientists suspected a viral infection or some new type of red tide.
But after testing water and manatee blood samples, scientists from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the National Marine Fisheries Service found evidence of red tide.
They said cold winter temperatures forced the manatees to gather in the warmer waters of southwest Florida, where the red-tide concentrations were highest.
Manatees migrate from the Carolinas to Florida every winter. They have inhabited Florida's waters for the past 45 million years, but due in part to increasing motorboat traffic, their numbers have dwindled to about 2,600.

Mirror, Mirror In looking for a wood product they could build and sell, a Franklin couple finds a classic

Abstract: The Williamses' hunch proved to be a good one. A little over a year after moving to Maine in 1990, they began producing small wood-framed mirrors in a workshop adjoining their Cape home in the Hancock County town of Franklin. They have gone from selling several hundred a year to fine gift shops largely in Maine to supplying a couple thousand annually to retail stores as far afield as Washington state -- even Japan. Their pieces also have been carried in well-known catalogs such as Yield House, Eddie Bauer, Sugar Hill and Ballard Designs. By that time, [Hugh Williams] and Avis had decided they were ready for a change of scenery. She had lived in Yarmouth and Kennebunk before and had always had it in mind to move back to Maine. Combing the weekly newspapers, they found a rental ad for a farmhouse and barn in Milbridge. They put down a two-month deposit on the property, sight unseen, and headed north. At first, Avis peddled the wood-framed mirrors out of the back of her Isuzu Trooper, selling to gift, bath, lighting, framing and furniture shops along the Maine coast. Sheepscot Pottery in Edgecomb was one of the couple's early accounts.

Full text: Mirrors. They can create airiness and illusions of space in a room. They can enhance lighting and add a touch of elegance to a home.
Straightforward to build, and not so big they can't be shipped directly from their shop, framed mirrors seemed promising to Hugh and Avis Williams seven years ago when they were looking for a wood product they could build and sell together.
The Williamses' hunch proved to be a good one. A little over a year after moving to Maine in 1990, they began producing small wood-framed mirrors in a workshop adjoining their Cape home in the Hancock County town of Franklin. They have gone from selling several hundred a year to fine gift shops largely in Maine to supplying a couple thousand annually to retail stores as far afield as Washington state -- even Japan. Their pieces also have been carried in well-known catalogs such as Yield House, Eddie Bauer, Sugar Hill and Ballard Designs.
Initially, the Williamses built all of the mirrors themselves. Now, they employ three people.
"When we moved to Maine, we really wanted to create a lifestyle that we had control over, and we really like to work with our hands to create things," said Avis. "Hugh and I have no children together, so this product is our baby. The business and our employees have become, in a sense, a family."
Classic designs and consistent quality come to mind when describing the Williamses' line of wood-framed, beveled mirrors.
Turned rosette blocks -- the kind found on door frames and window casings in 19th century New England houses -- grace some of the mirrors. Others feature ornaments pressed from old Victorian dies and crown and dentil molding.
The Williamses' frames are made largely from Eastern white pine, but some come in oak and cherry with an oil finish. Others boast a stained or painted finish ranging in hues from mustard to burgundy. These days, the most popular style has been a crackled, lightly distressed finish.
Shaded by a row of old, handsome maples, the Williamses' granite-gray clapboard home with cream-colored trim and their adjacent workshop sit on a rural road winding along the eastern shore of Hog Bay in Franklin. Blue, green, brown and white antique bottles line the windowsills. A crab trap with small oyster shells caught in the wire mesh hangs as a sculpture on the wall.
Over coffee and freshly baked blueberry buckle, the Williamses relate that they previously lived in Wilmington, N.C. -- that state's largest seaport -- at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. She ran her own dress shop. He worked as a free-lance finish carpenter in the boat-building industry. Working with fine wood such as teak and mahogany, he finished the often-extravagant interiors of cruising sailboats measuring as long as 55 feet.
The two married in 1989. For years, Hugh had enjoyed an ideal living situation. He rented a charming saltwater farmhouse framed by live oak trees dripping with moss for the amazing price of $65 per month. He recalls his landlady lamenting when she had to boost his rent to $50 from $45.
"I hate to see things go up," he recalls her saying.
But the landlady died, leaving the property to her Lutheran church, and he was forced to move out.
By that time, Hugh and Avis had decided they were ready for a change of scenery. She had lived in Yarmouth and Kennebunk before and had always had it in mind to move back to Maine. Combing the weekly newspapers, they found a rental ad for a farmhouse and barn in Milbridge. They put down a two-month deposit on the property, sight unseen, and headed north.
Both driving vehicles hauling trailers behind, the Williamses and their two cats arrived in Milbridge to find their prospective Maine home unlivable. Leaving one of their vehicles and the two trailers in the driveway, they rented a motel room for the night and set out in search of an empty house to rent.
"We turned left from Route 200 onto the Hog Bay Road and drove a ways," remembers Hugh. "I said, `Avis that house doesn't look lived in."'
The clapboard Cape happened to be for rent. They moved in that night and have been there ever since. They ended up buying the place less than a year later.
During the couple's first year in Maine, Avis landed work hanging floral wallpaper in a shingle-style summer cottage on Grindstone Neck in Winter Harbor. That job led to Hugh's being hired to remodel the kitchen and upstairs bathroom in the same house.
The Williamses say it was Hugh's construction of some wooden frames for Franklin painter and sculptor Phil Barter that inspired the idea of coming up with a small wooden product they could make together.
At first, Avis peddled the wood-framed mirrors out of the back of her Isuzu Trooper, selling to gift, bath, lighting, framing and furniture shops along the Maine coast. Sheepscot Pottery in Edgecomb was one of the couple's early accounts.
"Luckily, mirrors fit into a variety of stores," Avis says. "They are good complements."
The Williamses credit the state-run Small Business Development Center's Maine Products Marketing Program with helping them devise a marketing strategy. They began traveling to trade shows in New York, Philadelphia and High Point, N.C.
"We were a little fish in a big ocean," she says. Adding to their delight, they found few if any exhibitors selling mirrors.
"There was almost nobody."
The trade shows were an education to the couple, who learned how to price and position their product for the wholesale market. They also acquired a sales representative.
The latest wave in furniture has been the worn look, so the Williamses learned the five-step crackled finish technique. First, a base coat of paint is applied to the frame. Next, a layer of glue is put on, followed by a topcoat and a clear coat of lacquer.
"You can watch it crackle before your eyes," says Avis, adding that the frames are lightly sanded in key spots to enhance the worn look.
The Williamses' latest coup has been to land a request from the Atlanta-based Ballard Designs retail catalog, which features fine home and garden furnishings, for an inventory of 450 mirrors.
Scrambling to fill the order, they also are preparing to show their product line at trade shows in Atlanta and Los Angeles.
In the midst of all this, the couple has bought and is renovating a more-than-a-century-old clapboard store -- known for years as Jerry's Hardware -- and adjacent buildings where they hope to relocate their shop.
The Williamses attribute their success to plain hard work.
"We put in an enormous amount of effort into making the business fly," says Hugh. "We are really on top of the quality control. You don't want to have to replace a mirror. That is as expensive as making it all over again."
Hugh also sees their ability to work together as key.
"I usually defer to Avis as long as I agree with her," he says, chuckling.

Scoop in hand, perched like a child at the edge of a sandbox, the bearded, purple-clad Gargiulo clearly is pacing himself as the midday sun blazes overhead. Seasoned by a previous dig in Searsmont, the amateur archaeologist patiently smooths away another layer of blackish soil in the 5-square-foot pit he shares with a partner.
"I'm taking it one scrape at a time," says the Falmouth schoolteacher, smiling. After all, what has been waiting for hundreds and thousands of years deserves painstaking care.
Like Gargiulo, many of the tuition-paying volunteers at the Maine State Museum's third annual field school confess to the allure of a common fantasy: finding an artifact on a par with the 11th century Norse coin amateur archaeologist Guy Mellgren turned up here at the Goddard site nearly 40 years ago.
"Oh, it would be real chummy to find another one," one ardent digger says.
That lone Norse coin found in 1957 helped focus the attention of state museum archaeologists on the privately owned site within an old shorefront estate named for its owner, DeWitt Goddard.
Archaeologists concluded the silver coin was introduced to the site through trade between local Indians and peoples to the northeast, possibly from Newfoundland or as far away as Greenland.
Although no other evidence suggesting a Norse presence here has been found, artifacts from several periods have inspired continuing fascination with the site, says field school project director Dr. Steven Cox, a state museum archaeologist.
So far the site has yielded 15,000 objects, including stone tools and pottery vessels. Many of the items, including the Norse coin, are on display at the museum in Augusta.
An article Cox co-wrote with colleague Bruce Bourque after their work at Goddard in 1979 and 1980 concluded that the site was a "major summer village during the period of Norse visits to North America, and that its population participated in extensive trade networks ultimately reaching as far north as Ramah Bay, Labrador."
The site appears to have been occupied, at least intermittently, for thousands of years. The epochs best represented by artifacts are the "late ceramic" from 1,000 to 500 years ago, and the "Moorehead phase" of 4,000 to 3,700 years ago.
Cox says the primary aim of this field school session, ending June 28, is to expand upon the findings of archaeologist Warren K. Moorehead, whose work in the early part of the century focused on burial grounds of the so-called Red Paint People living in what is now New England and Nova Scotia.
The name comes from the discovery of a reddish pigmented material found in the soil of the burial sites. Cox refers to the Red Paints as "Moorehead people" and areas such as Goddard known to contain their artifacts as "Moorehead sites."
Goddard is one of a very few Moorehead sites yet excavated that is not a burial ground, says Cox, and this is the first dig there since 1980. Cox hopes the current crew will unearth habitation features such as pits with datable food bones, allowing researchers to "isolate points in time."
"We know a lot about how Mooreheads buried people, but what I'm interested in is how they lived. Some of the most interesting stuff we haven't gotten to yet," Cox says of the digging.
By the middle of their first week, field school participants working as deep as 10 inches into the six pits were only beginning to hit the reddish-brown soil signaling a transition into the Moorehead period.
"The deeper you go, the earlier you get. We're just starting to come into subsoil," says field archaeologist Laurie LaBar-Kidd, adding, "This is a very famous site. It's really exciting to be here."
For LaBar-Kidd, the high point has been the discovery of possible post molds, dark patches in the soil indicating the former presence of vertical posts. Depending on their placement pattern, the markings might indicate that structures such as fish drying racks or habitations once stood here.
"That's actually the most fascinating thing. It's not the tools. It's the funny little signs in the ground," says the bandana-wearing archaeologist.
"I'd like to find a gouge or an adz," confides Susan Moore, a teacher from Boylston, Mass. Moore has participated in five digs in recent years, some of them with her daughter, Jessica, now 12, who has accompanied her to Goddard.
"The first time I took my daughter on a dig, she came only reluctantly. Then she found a piece of pottery in my square, and she took over," recalls Moore.
"I did not, Mom!" protests Jessica from her end of the pit.
At a Great Gott Island dig two years ago, Moore was "thrilled" to find an engraved bone that may have been a handle for a knife, and a piece of pottery that had been decorated with a stick.
That's when she got hooked.
"I think the fascination is just learning and appreciating the people that lived thousands of years ago -- how they made the best use of materials available to them, whether it was food, stone, or bones from animals," says Moore.
For Gargiulo, the dig fulfills dual purposes.
It speaks to his interest in human evolution, and "it's just a good break for me after a school year. I'm not home fighting with my wife and kids," he adds, laughing heartily. "This gives you some solid ground to transfer your emotions to. It's kind of like Buddhist meditation."
One of the older diggers in the group, white-haired Roger Willis of Dover-Foxcroft, said his first foray into archaeology was a dig sponsored by the University of Chicago in southern Illinois in 1935. Since retiring after a long career with paint retailer Sherwin-Williams & Co., he has been "messing around," he says.
Tending his pit, the lanky retiree allows that digging can take its toll. "It gets hard on the back and knees. I didn't bring my 10-pound coffee can," he says ruefully. "It's the perfect size to sit on."
For an instant, Willis brightens noticeably, having gleaned a potsherd from soil the color of coffee grounds. "Oh, come on, have a design," he pleads. Alas, it's a plain piece of pottery.
Before long, however, he will unearth a decorated piece, one of several found in recent days enhanced with designs made using cord-wrapped or dented sticks.
At the other end of the project area, digging partners Pat Skaling and Cynthia Melnikas keep finding flakes, which are byproducts of stone toolmaking, and small stone scrapers whose edges show evidence of having been worked by hand.
"This little baby is so pretty," says Melnikas, peering at a notched point of reddish-green chert she and Skaling found at Goddard last week. "We were very down and singing to the spirits. Then, five minutes later, we found this," she recalls.
Considered abundant at the site, the chert artifacts are believed to originate from the Munsungan Lake area in northern Maine, and to belong to the late ceramic period.
Owner of a Deer Isle bed-and-breakfast, Melnikas cut her teeth digging at a site in the Florida Everglades and now works at the Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor, specializing in American Indian antiquities.
Melnikas says she knows from experience that it is best to keep expectations at bay on a dig, but it's hard not to be excited when you think you're on to something.
For Skaling, a former teacher from Belfast, the ultimate find would be a seal effigy, a hope that may be wishful thinking. "We find little rocks we call effigies," she says. "Of course, they're nothing, but we use our imaginations."
She mentions seals because they are believed to have been a major food source for the late ceramic people, along with fish, deer and small mammals. A "fair number" of sea mink and great auk bones have been found in Moorehead sites, but Cox does not expect diggers to find them here.
While most such sites contain shellfish remains which help to preserve bones in the soil, Goddard apparently does not, because the seasonal habitation here did not coincide well with shellfish harvesting. The only type of older bones likely to be found here are burnt ones, which do preserve, says Cox.
Preservation is an issue for the field school in yet another crucial regard, Cox says. Since funds for archaeological work remain limited, tuition, room and board proceeds from sessions such as this summer's are the only funding likely to allow Goddard Site excavation to continue.
Its justifications seem obvious. Scanning the boat-strewn, blue-gray bay on this nearly perfect day, Cox adds, "I can't think of a nicer place to work."

Abstract: The dozen or so towns on the Quebec side of Lake Memphremagog require boaters to wash their vessels before putting them into the lake to reduce the risk that boats will carry in the tiny mussels in bilge water or attached to the hull. Six washing stations have been built on Memphremagog's shores. No boat-washing ordinances exist in Vermont, and there are no zebra mussel washing stations at docks on the Vermont side of the Memphremagog. But now Newport is putting the final touches on a washing station it built in town. No mussels have yet been found in Memphremagog, a majestic high-altitude body of water that stretches almost 30 miles and straddles the Vermont-Quebec border.

Full text: NEWPORT, Vt. -- They might hitch a ride on a boat hull; they might ride in on a wave.
They are zebra mussels, the damaging mollusks that rapidly infested Lake Champlain, and now officials of the towns that share the Lake Memphremagog shoreline are teaming up to make sure they're not next.
"Life revolves around the lake," said Newport Town Manager Ken Magoon. "{Zebra mussels} come in, and the lake is dead."
The dozen or so towns on the Quebec side of Lake Memphremagog require boaters to wash their vessels before putting them into the lake to reduce the risk that boats will carry in the tiny mussels in bilge water or attached to the hull. Six washing stations have been built on Memphremagog's shores.
No boat-washing ordinances exist in Vermont, and there are no zebra mussel washing stations at docks on the Vermont side of the Memphremagog. But now Newport is putting the final touches on a washing station it built in town.
"This is why Magog hired me; it was to get Vermont going," said Raymond Cloutier, a Quebec environmental management expert who works with all the towns that share the lake. "We've been yelling since 1987 that we were surely going to have to organize something here."
The small striped zebra mussels, natives of Europe, are thought to have arrived in North America in the 1980s when they were carried into the Great Lakes in the ballast of an ocean-going freighter. They were first discovered in southern Lake Champlain three years ago.
The mussels can clog the inlet pipes for water and sewage plants, foul boat keels, and litter beaches with their sharp shells.
"It's an incredible problem," said Kevin Coffey, an Irasburg resident who serves on the board of the Lake Memphremagag Watershed Association. "They're so prolific that they actually wipe out the other mussel species that are in the lakes."
No mussels have yet been found in Memphremagog, a majestic high-altitude body of water that stretches almost 30 miles and straddles the Vermont-Quebec border.
In all, the lake covers 37 square miles or about 24,000 acres, said Kevin Hauser, a zebra mussel specialist at the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources. About 75 percent of the lake is in Quebec.
For the Vermont towns that share the lakeshore, Memphremagog is a captivating focal point as well as a spectacular opportunity for tourism and recreation in the winter and summer. An entrepreneur recently trucked a paddleboat onto the lake for excursions in the summer months. And town officials estimate that literally thousands of boaters and fishermen use the waters each year.
"It's a very busy lake," said Bob Orr, Derby's selectboard chairman. "People come from all over."
Memphremagog is especially important to the dozen or so Quebec towns, with about 150,000 residents, that depend on it for their drinking water, Cloutier said.
Quebec officials became concerned in the early 1990s when they perceived that for all of their efforts, zebra mussel pollution could well enter their waters from the unregulated lakeshores to the south while the issue languished in state and local files.
That's when they hired Cloutier.
Now Vermont is starting to get with the program, say lakeshore residents who have been watching the zebra mussel threat closely.
Derby and Newport officials are discussing the problem with Quebec officials. And more importantly, the first washing station funded jointly by those towns opened this month in Newport.
Signs at boat landings will direct boaters to the station, located at the town garage. The station, staffed 12 hours a day by an attendant, will provide a hose with high-pressure hot water for rinsing off boats. It will be free.
"I'm happy that the city of Newport is doing this at least," said Coffey. "They're playing catch-up to the Canadian side."
Although Quebec has enacted ordinances with fines for boaters who fail to wash their boats, Magoon and Orr were pessimistic about the chances of getting similar measures passed in their towns any time soon.
"This year it's going to have to be a conscience thing," said Orr.
Cloutier credited alarm about the mussels' impact on Lake Champlain with prompting the towns' action on protecting Memphremagog.
"{Lake Champlain} is infested except for the eastern arm of the lake," said Cloutier. "That is only protected by a causeway. How long is it going to take? Maybe a year, and the whole lake is done, it's cooked."
And zebra mussels aren't the only problem. Other non-native species are being discovered in bodies of water where they don't belong, he said.
"There are tons of things lurking all around," Cloutier said. "What is going to happen next year? What is going to happen next summer that we don't know is coming?"

Abstract: The reduced use of elemental chlorine and other technological improvements in papermaking during the last several years have significantly reduced the amount of dioxin in Maine waters. Some mills have switched to using chlorine dioxide. This process has much to recommend it, including the fact that the chemical compound can be produced on site, and so does not require the transport of tankers carrying chlorine. It is also safer in the mill in the event of a leak, and it greatly reduces dioxin discharges without requiring a mill to make extensive changes in its facilities, as other dioxin-reducing plans do.

Full text: When Gov. Angus King this spring set the worthy goal of eliminating the need for dioxin-related fish advisories by the year 2000 he probably did not expect the Environmental Protection Agency to stand in his way. But unless the federal agency establishes clear pollution-control regulations, operators of Maine paper mills will have a difficult time knowing what adjustments they need to make.
The EPA had pledged to present industry with a set of cluster rules by August of this year, but recently suggested that the rules would not be ready until late October, which, in practice, means sometime after the elections, perhaps early next year. Cluster rules are standards for related pollution problems -- ozone, air and water toxins, wastewater discharge -- established in relation to each other rather than trickled out of the agency one at a time. A separate, detailed study of specific dangers of dioxin was due out of the EPA years ago but has been caught in perpetual peer review.
Executives from bleach kraft paper companies joined with the governor last April in support of his plan to lower dioxin levels in fish but, understandably, want to know what the federal rules are going to be before they invest in expensive equipment that may not meet the new standards. If the paper companies are going to help Gov. King meet his goal by 2000, they need direction from the EPA soon on what constitutes best-available technology for reducing dioxin.
Dioxin is a byproduct of incineration and industrial processes that use chlorine. It accumulates in animals, fish and shellfish -- with animals at the top of the food chain generally having the highest concentrations. High doses of dioxin cause chloracne, and may cause some types of cancers and bring on reproductive and developmental problems.
The reduced use of elemental chlorine and other technological improvements in papermaking during the last several years have significantly reduced the amount of dioxin in Maine waters. Some mills have switched to using chlorine dioxide. This process has much to recommend it, including the fact that the chemical compound can be produced on site, and so does not require the transport of tankers carrying chlorine. It is also safer in the mill in the event of a leak, and it greatly reduces dioxin discharges without requiring a mill to make extensive changes in its facilities, as other dioxin-reducing plans do.
Whether this technology will be acceptable to the EPA is as yet uncertain. But the agency's slow pace in establishing regulations is preventing Maine, and all other papermaking states, from making better progress in reducing this toxin.

Full text: LUBEC -- R.J. Peacock's spotless new Maine Freeze salmon plant gleams with high technology -- a $250,000 filleting machine, a $100,000 computer-guided laser fish cutter, a head and tail whacker at 50 grand, a patented flash-freezing process so top secret it's about to cost the Japanese a pretty yen to learn how it's done.
Of course, then there's the walk-in freezer scrounged for $300 from a remodeled grocery store, the stainless-steel walls and sinks salvaged from the defunct Limestone Air Force Base, the racks bought on the cheap from a bakery gone bust, all tucked into a cockeyed old sardine cannery that hasn't seen a lick of paint since FDR's first term.
Use it up, make it last, cobble it together. It's the Cobscook Bay way.
It's also the kind of development -- along with innovations in shellfish and seaweed farms and a just-unveiled urchin hatchery -- that has aquaculture poised to become a powerful economic engine in a region that has always been long on natural resources, but short on cash.
"Everything here is based on the sea: the cargo port, aquaculture, commercial fishing," said Bob Peacock, scion of the family business, ship's pilot, sardine packer, fish processor and a guy who has never met an impossibility he didn't like. "We're trying to create the kind of jobs that give our kids a reason to get a good education and the ability to stay here. We can't do that now, but we're building a new type of aquaculture that will."
What comes into Maine Freeze are slumbering salmon from a half-dozen local farms. What comes out are rock-hard blocks of Peacock's TruFresh brand, utterly indistinguishable from fresh except that they're precisely sized in plastic shrink-wrap (also patented), perfectly skinned and deboned, and flash-frozen in a concoction of brine and nontoxic chemicals at 40 below zero, a process that prevents the tissue damage that results from conventional freezing.
Ask the customers what they think -- the chefs of the Disney empire, of Marriott, of nearly every major hotel in Las Vegas, or the soon-to-be clients at Red Lobster, Steak & Ale and Bennigan's.
"This product was designed from the start for the food-service industry," Peacock said. "It has everything chefs want: exact portions, no waste, the highest quality. This has been a five-year project, but it's really starting to take off. It wasn't that long ago this room was filled with sardine packers doing piecework. Now we have 100 people working full time, and we're about to add a second shift. Not bad for little old Lubec."
It's also not bad for an industry that, despite $52 million in sales last year and a second-place finish on Maine's seafood money list, is ending its first decade in a slightly nervous state over a current market price that's less than half the $5 to $6 per pound of the early days.
Andy Stevenson of Maine Aqua Foods, a Canadian company with salmon pens in the bay and a hatchery in Bingham, said the price drop is both a challenge to employ better farming practices and an opportunity to make salmon an everyday meal instead of a special-occasion splurge.
"Sure, I regret I wasn't in aquaculture when salmon was six dollars a pound," Stevenson said. "I'd be relaxing on a beach in the Bahamas instead of squeezing eggs out of the rear end of a female salmon for the hatchery. ...
"There's no way the major producers -- the United States, Canada, Norway, Chile -- are ready to meet the exploding global demand of the future unless we improve our methods. If we do it right, salmon aquaculture will be a $200 million industry in Maine within 10 years."
The key, Stevenson said, is a shift from growing the most fish possible to growing bigger, better and stronger fish.
"At six dollars a pound, you could afford to put 100,000 smolts in the water, lose 45,000 to stress, disease and predation, and still make money," said Stevenson. "We're doing things today -- putting bigger smolt in the pens by being much more selective about brood stock, preventing disease with vaccination instead of trying to cure it with medicine, deterring predators -- that have cut our mortality to 5 1/2 percent."
While salmon remains the big dog on the aquaculture block, many say shellfish -- clams, mussels and now urchins -- are sniffing out a territory of their own.
Hank Stence is considered the father of Maine aquaculture, the holder of the state's first aquaculture lease. In a Forrest Gumpish way, he left the Navy in 1976, moved to Lubec to be near his mother, started diving for scallops and found himself thinking about hunting vs. gathering.
"It occurred to me as I was diving that people in other parts of the world, Asia in particular, had been farming the sea for centuries and here we were, in the most advanced country of the world, still chasing fish all over a huge ocean," Stence said. "I figured most people would starve to death if they had to hunt for their dinner every day, so I went down to the town office and applied for the first lease. Nobody even knew what I was talking about."
Stence, the farmer, started with 5 acres of true bottom land and, in genuine Down East style, planted an old onion bag filled with mussel seeds in the mud. "The idea was that sea water would flow through the bag, the mussels would grow, and the bag would blow up like Jiffy Pop. It worked."
Next, he tried oysters, with less happy results. "I was sowing oyster seeds when I kept noticing something moving out of the corner of my eye," Stence said. "It was two baby flounders, following behind me, eating every seed I'd planted. That's when I learned rule number one about aquaculture -- for everything you try to grow, there's always something bigger coming along to eat it."
Rule No. 2, he said, "is that you have to kill a few of whatever you're trying to grow to learn what you're doing. We've killed a few, but the nutrient level of Cobscook Bay is so high, the water quality is so great, there's enormous untapped potential.
"The people here have always been very protective of their natural resources, and it's about to pay off," Stence said. "What I see as the aquaculture of the future is polyculture -- a combination of small leases for salmon and shellfish, diversity that will protect your overall investment."
There will always be traditional fishermen, Stence said, but they and the farmers must work harder for peaceful coexistence.
"The biggest conflict today is with draggers. Our scallop season here opens November 1, a month earlier than the rest of the state, so we get 140 to 170 draggers up here, coming from all over. Of course we need to keep our farms out of the best scallop areas, but the draggers need to practice better conservation. The state needs to rotate open areas for dragging and to make our opening date the same as the rest of the state. This bay simply cannot support 170 draggers every November," he said.
Stence and Ralph DeWitt make up Peacock's new research and development team. Their first endeavor is an urchin hatchery, an idea spawned by a high school science project and nurtured by techniques borrowed from the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery.
With the state's young, $40 million urchin industry already in danger of imminent collapse from overfishing, DeWitt said the 10 million speck-sized larvae in the blue plastic tubs at the new hatchery will be the pioneers in an attempt to seed urchin beds and to create urchin farms.
"The kids at Lubec High did a science project keeping urchin larvae alive for a few hours," DeWitt said. "I heard about it and thought they were on to something, so we adapted Beals Island's methods for raising clams and started an apprenticeship program for high school kids interested in aquaculture. We've only had the hatchery running for a month. It's way too early to tell how it works, but we don't see any reason we can't grow urchins and keep this industry going. It's too valuable to just let it die."
The R&D team's second project, still on the drawing board, is an adaptation of Stence's old Jiffy Pop concept -- a sheet-sized piece of nylon fabric sewn into a bag, weighted and seeded with clams. The idea is that burying it in the mud for a few years and doing something else in the meantime beats mucking around in a knee-deep mud flat at every low tide.
Dale Sherrard, chairman of the Sunrise County Economic Council, said the latest innovations in aquaculture shouldn't surprise anyone who knows the people behind them.
"By necessity, folks around here are used to having to figure out a way to make something work when it probably shouldn't,"
Sherrard said. "Example: A couple of years ago, we had a sea cucumber industry grow up overnight, 100 good, full-time jobs.
Almost immediately, we came close to losing those jobs when it was discovered the waste decomposed to create a byproduct of some toxicity -- this new industry was going to be shut down before it really got started.
"We got some research money and found out that we could extract a red pigment from the waste that makes a nice enhancement for salmon feed," he said, "and the rest of the waste -- now nontoxic -- makes the best compost I've ever seen. I grew some monster corn with it last summer.
"We turned a problem into an opportunity," Sherrard said. "That's the way here -- whatever obstacle comes along, eventually we'll go around it, over it or through it."

Abstract: A 1959 English Ford Thames, an import minivan, was Stephen McCausland's real first car, although a same-year English Ford Prefect, about the size of McCausland's desk, was the one that the Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman used to get his driver's test in the mid-'60s. The metallic blue, 12-seater Thames was a great vehicle, McCausland said. Luckily, his father was a mechanic and saw quite a bit of the Thames, for which parts were very hard to come by. McCausland has owned dozens of vehicles since then, but the Thames remains a great memory. He even has a picture of the Thames on the wall of his Augusta office.

Full text: It's a milestone like no other, almost eclipsing such revered remembrances as your wedding day or the birth of your first child.
It marked the brief time in your life when you possessed true independence, when the world was truly your oyster, when you finally knew that you were really going places and had the wheels to set your destiny in motion.
Say it quietly to yourself. "My first car ..."
Close your eyes and you are back behind the wheel. You can see every detail of the dash. All of the radio buttons are set on the coolest stations. The gas gauge is on "E," whether the motor is idling or off. A personalized key ring, for which you spent months searching before you even bought the car, dangles from the ignition. You loved that car, bondo and all. It was as close to nirvana as you will ever get. And some days, if the planets were in the right order and if it wasn't raining too hard, you could even get it to start.
If Americans are in love with their cars, their first courtship with a Vega or Falcon was blind adulation. Oh, how that first car treated us, always breaking down, barely passing inspection, always taking and taking and rarely giving anything in return. But how we loved it.
A 1959 English Ford Thames, an import minivan, was Stephen McCausland's real first car, although a same-year English Ford Prefect, about the size of McCausland's desk, was the one that the Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman used to get his driver's test in the mid-'60s.
The metallic blue, 12-seater Thames was a great vehicle, McCausland said. Luckily, his father was a mechanic and saw quite a bit of the Thames, for which parts were very hard to come by.
"I toted half of my high school class around town in that thing," McCausland recalled. "It could seat a dozen people. I tell you it made me a popular guy."
Years later, McCausland saw a van that looked similar to the Thames in a Brunswick junkyard. Unable to resist, he walked to the van, opened the door and slipped in behind the wheel. He then got out of the vehicle and popped the hood. There, after all these years, were his initials and those of his friends still carved into the roof of the hood.
McCausland has owned dozens of vehicles since then, but the Thames remains a great memory. He even has a picture of the Thames on the wall of his Augusta office.
Mathys Van Dam's first car was a 1934 Ford convertible. Pittsfield's recycling coordinator can still remember every detail of the car he drove around Boston as a teen-ager in the 1940s.
"It was black with a white top and had yellow wheels," he recalled. "The upholstery was brown leather, and it had a rumble seat."
Back in those days, "you were a rich man if you had a car," said Van Dam. He drove all over Boston in the car, paying between 15 and 17 cents a gallon to motor his way through the city's notorious traffic.
Van Dam says the car held a lot of great memories, as did his second car, a 1935 Pontiac in which he courted his wife. The Pontiac was not always as cooperative as the Ford, though, and had to be parked on a Boston hill and allowed to roll before it would start during the winter months, he said.
Karen Allen's first car was one some of us could only ever dream about having.
"It was a 1979 Ford Mustang, gray with maroon interior," recalled the assistant to the president at Kennebec Valley Technical College in Fairfield.
Allen's father bought the car for her while she was a junior in high school in Windham in 1984, and she made weekly payments to dad to reimburse him.
"A lot of people liked to ride with me," she said, laughing.
There was that day when she first drove the car. "I remember sitting in it for the first time and thinking, `This is great!' " Allen said.
She kept that car in great shape, probably better than the upkeep of her present car, washing it every week and having it waxed at least twice a year.
Steve Whitesel, Dexter town manager, remembers his first car, bought in 1959, like it was yesterday.
"Oh, was it a beauty," he said. "It was a 1938 Chevy coupe, hand-painted gray, with alternately painted black and white louvers. It was just a beautiful car."
Whitesel's father bought it for him during his sophomore year in Idaho.
"I'd gotten five A's and one B on my report card, and my folks decided that I was grown-up enough to have a car. Oh, it was just a gorgeous car. I tell you, I was the envy of my classmates.
"The next semester," Whitesel said, laughing, "I got five B's and one A."
While working at a canning plant, Whitesel let one of his friends borrow the car. It later came back with a cracked windshield, a grinding transmission and a knocking rod. The windshield and transmission were fixable, he recalled, but not so with the rod.
"I still think of that car a lot," he said. "In fact, I just saw one just like it the other day, and I said, `Hey, that's my car.' "
Whitesel still has pictures of the car back home in Idaho, and to this day, can still remember the first song he heard on the radio, which he had to personally install in the coupe.
"It was `Kansas City' by Wilbert Harrison. I started it up and that song came on, and, well ... I just loved that car."

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Using sea urchins as a case study, a panel of fishermen and scientists on Thursday discussed how commercial fishing's all-out assaults on certain species can throw the entire ocean ecosystem out of whack.
The session, sponsored by the Island Institute and the Mainewatch Institute, included a screening of a new video, "Under Water, Out of Sight," produced and directed by David Conover. It looks at the impacts and stresses current fishing practices place on the complex Gulf of Maine environment.
Panelists were University of Maine oceanography professor Robert Steneck, Department of Marine Resources scientist Linda Mercer, lobsterman David Cousens, urchin harvester Jim James and marine biologist and fisherman Ted Ames.
Ignored by fishermen until less than 10 years ago, an explosion in the urchin population led to the establishment of Far East roe markets that has vaulted urchins to second place in value of wild harvests in Maine. Hundreds of millions of pounds have been taken in that period and the inshore ocean bottom virtually has been stripped clean.
One short-term side effect of the urchin frenzy seems to be beneficial: Urchins are prodigious grazers, devouring kelp at astonishing speed. With no urchins left, a luxuriant kelp forest develops, providing protective cover for young lobsters and other valuable species of shellfish and fin fish.
What remains unanswered, Steneck said, is what caused the urchin explosion in the first place and what will be the longer-term result of their sudden, man-made removal.
"This is an interesting case study of one species' impact on a whole ecosystem," he said. "Urchins are the dominant grazers -- commercial fishing tends to target the higher-level predators, the top of the food chain. From a scientific viewpoint, this is an excellent opportunity to see how this complex environment reacts when a dominant organism is targeted and removed suddenly."
While the urchin harvest has an up side for other species, Steneck noted that some recent fishing practices have immediate negative effects, citing the use of "rock-hopping" dragging gear that can scoop young groundfish from behind rocks that used to provide protective cover from predators.
Mercer, who is overseeing the deployment of a $360,000 urchin research fund garnered from license fees, said the drastic change wrought by the urchin industry "shows how complex fishery management issues cannot be managed on a species-by-species basis. There is a real need to understand the interaction between species, to maintain a balance in the ecosystem."
Cousens, president of the Main Lobstermen's Association, said fishermen and scientists "have been in adversarial roles for years, but that has to change. We're working more with scientists now, we've come a long way, we know what we need to do on management issues. Now the politics comes in, the hard part."
While the urchin "gold rush" clearly is on the wane, Cousens cautioned that another unused species, the whelk, is on the brink of a boom. "Are we going to keep repeating this pattern of depleting a species, cleaning it out and then acting to preserve what's no longer there? We always do the damage long before the Legislature can act."
James, head of the Maine Urchin Harvesters Association, said the explosion in his business and a decline in the last two years should be a warning to all fishermen of what can happen when an industry develops without a long-range plan.
"At first, the state sold as many licenses as it could, now we've got a moratorium. We had a boom, now we might be heading for a collapse. I've heard people say we should just wipe all the urchins out and get it over with. We have to decide whether restricting entry into a fishery is being elitist or preserving a resource," he said.
Ames, a marine biologist and the former head of the state gillnetters' association, said Maine has seen numerous boom and bust fisheries over the years and is only now realizing it doesn't have to be that way.
"We've seen the consequences of fishermen not working with scientists -- it leads to collapse. In groundfish, there are thousands of formerly well-employed fishermen who now no longer have a resource because we didn't deal with the issues. We need knowledge, we need data to make rational decisions," he said.

Abstract: BREWER - Mix unripened blueberries, leaves, and twigs. Add sawdust along with crushed blue mussel shells, peat moss and discard salmon parts and you wind up with a concoction unpalatable to even hungry bears. A new Maine company is hoping that this mixture will be the recipe for success, since it is gardeners, not gourmets, that the company is hoping will come to appreciate it. Coast of Maine Organic Products Inc., a newly established business in Portland, is now offering an all-purpose compost made from waste products, such as salmon remains, mussel shells and the leftovers from the blueberry harvest. Normally loaded onto barges and dumped in the ocean, these waste materials have found new purpose as a natural fertilizer. The company, incorporated in March, has named its mixture Penobscot Blend, although its ingredients come from Washington County.

Full text: BREWER - Mix unripened blueberries, leaves, and twigs. Add sawdust along with crushed blue mussel shells, peat moss and discard salmon parts and you wind up with a concoction unpalatable to even hungry bears.
A new Maine company is hoping that this mixture will be the recipe for success, since it is gardeners, not gourmets, that the company is hoping will come to appreciate it.
Coast of Maine Organic Products Inc., a newly established business in Portland, is now offering an all-purpose compost made from waste products, such as salmon remains, mussel shells and the leftovers from the blueberry harvest. Normally loaded onto barges and dumped in the ocean, these waste materials have found new purpose as a natural fertilizer. The company, incorporated in March, has named its mixture Penobscot Blend, although its ingredients come from Washington County. The compost comes in a plastic bag decorated on the front with a watercolor painting of islands and pine-tree covered peninsulas jutting out along Penobscot Bay.
Backed by a $30,000 rural development federal grant through the Eastern Maine Development Corp., Carlos Quijano and his Coast of Maine company hope to hit paydirt with the compost.
Beginning this week, 200 tons of the 40-pound bags of Penobscot Blend are being produced and prepared for marketing to areas in southern Maine and New England, said Quijano, who spent more than two decades in commercial and investment banking with Chase-Manhattan Bank and now is president of a Portland consulting firm.
The third shipment this week went out Wednesday evening, headed for the Boston area and parts of New Hampshire. Quijano said another shipment, headed for Maine, will go out today.
Although primarily headed for the larger population centers, stores in Old Town, Camden and Rockland have already bought some to sell to customers, said Quijano.
The 40-pound bag wholesales for about $3.40 although Quijano expects the retail price to be about double that.
The idea for the compost came after a mussel farm in Tenants Harbor hired him out to find alternatives to their composting of the company's waste byproducts. He found that the often nutrient-rich materials were going unused, either being dumped in the ocean, or thrown in landfills.
"There's not much you can do with 1,000 pounds of salmon guts," he admitted late Wednesday, adding that unused parts of sea urchins, mussels and other shellfish also have limited uses. With an abundant and unused resource available and low-level production underway, Quijano and Coast of Maine are now looking for markets and for sales. Another 300 tons is expected to be produced in June for distribution for the fall and to be brought to trade shows in January.
Ultimately to wring the most efficiency and profit out of the project, Quijano sees producing 10,000 tons of the compost. And Quijano sees operations expanding into Maine's midcoast region.
Going into full-scale production will mean new jobs in job-poor Washington County. Not a lot of jobs, he said, but jobs nonetheless. It will also mean an environmentally-friendly and possibly profitable solution to waste produced in Maine's fishing industries.
As well as offering a hand up for gardeners and other green thumbs, Penobscot Blend is providing a new opportunity for the Brewer company that is packaging the compost.
Mixed and packaged in Brewer by W.H. Shurtleff Co., a well-known municipal supplier of road salt and other ice melters, Penobscot Blend is putting to work Shurtleff machines that traditionally have remained idle this time of year, explained Gerry Bosse, branch manager of the Shurtleff Brewer facility.
With little chance of a hefty snow or ice storm on the horizon, there's no need for the road salt and de-icers and no need for the machines and workers that package them.
Machines like conveyor belts and hoppers are now back on line, sifting out larger unwanted refuse from the compost, funneling it into bags and then sealing them.
To make Penobscot Blend, the recipe's ingredients are mixed together by the ton, not the teaspoon. Brought into Shurtleff's massive quonset hut, the seperate piles of mussel shells, peat moss, sawdust from hemlock, spruce and fir trees and the other materials are mixed together using a front-end loader and a wind rower.
The wind rower, borrowed from the University of Maine, makes long lines of the compost which sit until a moisture content of 40 percent is reached and the compost is readied for packaging.
For the South Portland-based Shurtleff, the off-season business is a welcome opportunity as the company looks to expand business and diversify its operations.
Bosse said the company will be expanding operations into recycling efforts and using its facilities for collecting, warehousing and then shipping products elsewhere. The company is looking for other uses of existing equipment as well as new areas where there is little to no competition and plenty of room to grow.
"We like to find products that no one else is doing," Bosse said.

Abstract: A mere 10 [Warren] voters -- including four selectmen who had to be there -- turned out to unanimously endorse a regional shellfish management ordinance and an interlocal clam management agreement that, if approved in upcoming votes in Cushing, South Thomaston, Thomaston and St. George, will create the rules and governing structure for the long-awaited rebirth of clamming on the river's flats. The ordinance, the "nuts and bolts" of how the five towns can prevent overharvesting, establishes requirements, harvest limits and fees for resident commercial and recreational licenses and nonresident commercial licenses, and sets penalties for violations. The number of licenses, the allowable harvest and the opening and closing of specific flats will be determined each year based upon the recommendation of the shellfish committee and a state biologist. Selectman John Crabtree, who helped develop the interlocal agreement, said the plan "makes all five towns equal partners, with equal shares. Everything is divided by five. Warren gets one-fifth of the licenses. There's no appropriation asked for, but if there is ever a need for money, Warren will be asked to raise one-fifth."

Full text: WARREN -- A plan for five towns to oversee the revival and preservation of the St. George River shellfish industry easily passed its first test at a miniature town meeting here Monday.
A mere 10 Warren voters -- including four selectmen who had to be there -- turned out to unanimously endorse a regional shellfish management ordinance and an interlocal clam management agreement that, if approved in upcoming votes in Cushing, South Thomaston, Thomaston and St. George, will create the rules and governing structure for the long-awaited rebirth of clamming on the river's flats.
Most of the river has been closed to shellfish harvesting for the last 10 years because of pollution. Recent investments by Warren and Thomaston to improve waste water treatment and upgrade residential septic systems throughout the region make it likely the state Department of Marine Resources will approve the reopening of substantial areas within the next month or so.
It is estimated that the once-lucrative flats could sustain yields $1 million or more worth of clams each year if managed properly, but there is concern that the resource could be wiped out overnight if the flats reopen with no conservation plan in place.
While Warren took care of presenting information about the plan and bringing it to a vote in one night, the other towns will deal with those tasks in two sessions: St. George, public hearing May 13, vote May 28; Cushing, hearing May 13, vote May 21; Thomaston, hearing May 20, vote June 3; and South Thomaston, hearing May 15, vote May 29.
The ordinance and agreement were developed over several months by clammers and other volunteers with the Georges River Clam Fishery Restoration Project, formed in anticipation of the reopening of the flats.
The interlocal agreement calls the resource to be administered by a five-member joint board, with one selectman from each town. A 15-member shellfish management committee, with three members from each town, will serve in an advisory capacity to the joint board.
The joint board will have the authority to set the number of licenses to be issued each year, to establish license fees, to open and close flats for conservation, to set digging times and limits on harvest quantities, and other regulations and restrictions permitted by state laws and regulations. Recommendations of the management committee can only be rejected by the joint board with a unanimous vote.
The ordinance, the "nuts and bolts" of how the five towns can prevent overharvesting, establishes requirements, harvest limits and fees for resident commercial and recreational licenses and nonresident commercial licenses, and sets penalties for violations. The number of licenses, the allowable harvest and the opening and closing of specific flats will be determined each year based upon the recommendation of the shellfish committee and a state biologist.
The number of licenses will be divided equally among the five towns. It is hoped the project will be able to support itself, including the salary of a shellfish warden, on income from license fees and fines. The number of licenses to be issued the first year will be determined after it is know how much area will be certified for reopening by the state.
As an incentive for continued volunteerism, commercial diggers who perform 10 hours of management work a year, such as surveying clam populations and growth rates and monitoring water quality, will be able to purchase their licenses two days ahead of the next year's opening date.
Sherman Hoyt of St. George, the volunteer coordinator of the restoration project, said the reopening of the flats without a local management plan in effect "will bring an influx of diggers from all over the state -- a gold rush. I know some of our town clerks have gotten calls from diggers all over the state, asking when the flats will open. A resource that could add one or two million {dollars} to the economy year after year could be wiped out in a few weeks. We've had 25 to 40 people working on these documents. It's the best we could do -- I think it will be the best shellfish ordinance in Maine to prevent overfishing."
Selectman John Crabtree, who helped develop the interlocal agreement, said the plan "makes all five towns equal partners, with equal shares. Everything is divided by five. Warren gets one-fifth of the licenses. There's no appropriation asked for, but if there is ever a need for money, Warren will be asked to raise one-fifth."

Group seeds clam beds Americorps members set up growth experiments

Abstract: Also on Tuesday, Americorps members and other volunteers were in Lubec's Cobscook Bay, seeding 20,000 clams in two nets and 5,000 clams in each of five protector pockets. In Casco Bay, volunteers in South Portland and Scarborough were cleaning up flats, transplanting clams and conducting an inventory of predatory green crabs. According to Sam Chapman of the Waldoboro Shellfish Committee, the goal of the work here is to bring some modern aquacultural techniques to the potentially lucrative but neglected clam fishery. "Clams have become a forgotten resource, something people harvest when there's nothing else to do," Chapman said. "It's an unfortunate attitude, since clam harvesting could become an extremely important and sustainable industry. We're looking for ways we can make unproductive flats productive again and for ways to keep good flats productive." "I went clam digging once as a kid. Now I remember why I never did it again," [Justin White] said, taking a break from digging a trench in the pungent mud. "Actually, it's a good change of pace from most of the work we do, building trails and other conservation projects, but I definitely prefer the woods. My major is outdoor recreation -- I don't think clam digging's going to catch on as recreation."

Full text: WALDOBORO -- It's a long way from the azalea gardens of Augusta, Ga., to the mud flats of Waldoboro, but for Americorps's Marjorie Goldberg, a day seeding clam beds was a truly "oozesome" experience.
"This is my first time on a flat -- we don't have anything like this in Georgia," the Americorps team leader said through a mask of muck Tuesday. "I never anticipated being in mud halfway to my knees when I signed up, but it's great. It's kind of fun to play in, plus we're doing something worthwhile."
What Goldberg and 20 other Americorps members were doing wallowing about in Arthur's Cove at low tide was setting up protected clam beds and growth experiments, part of the Seeding For Maine's Future program going on along the coast on the designated National Day of Service.
Americorps, called the domestic Peace Corps, has more than 100 members in Maine, working in projects in conservation, outdoor recreation, agriculture, public health, homelessness, education and youth programs. Members commit to a year of service and receive a living allowance, health insurance and a financial award for education.
Also on Tuesday, Americorps members and other volunteers were in Lubec's Cobscook Bay, seeding 20,000 clams in two nets and 5,000 clams in each of five protector pockets. In Casco Bay, volunteers in South Portland and Scarborough were cleaning up flats, transplanting clams and conducting an inventory of predatory green crabs.
According to Sam Chapman of the Waldoboro Shellfish Committee, the goal of the work here is to bring some modern aquacultural techniques to the potentially lucrative but neglected clam fishery. "Clams have become a forgotten resource, something people harvest when there's nothing else to do," Chapman said. "It's an unfortunate attitude, since clam harvesting could become an extremely important and sustainable industry. We're looking for ways we can make unproductive flats productive again and for ways to keep good flats productive."
The centerpiece of the experiment is to gauge the survival rate of clam larvae in pure, native mud sediment compared to those grown in a mixture of mud and sand.
"The hypothesis is that the grains of sand provide some protection to the seed clams and encourage better growth," said Chapman. "If it's so, I can see the day when harvesters will carry a bag of sand on each trip out and spread it as they work, gradually creating small plots of clam farms."
The idea of farming clams, rather than hunting them, could bring tremendous economic benefits to coastal Maine, Chapman said. "A town could lease a small area of a flat to an individual, who would be responsible for creating a good growth environment. A small, well-managed area, as small as a half-acre, could provide a person with a good living."
The biggest hurdle to developing privately managed clam farms on town-owned flats "isn't the biology or the mechanics or the ecology," Chapman said. "It's the social factor.
"The attitude now is that every bit of open flat has to be accessible to everyone, which doesn't do anyone any good if there's no clams," he said. "If towns would lease small areas to individuals, they'd create new employment opportunities and relieve some of the harvesting pressure from the wild flats.
"Everybody would win," he said. "The farmers would have a guaranteed area to improve and manage, and the wild harvesters would have less competition. ... The hard part will be convincing people to try something new."
Clamming wasn't something new for Americorps member Justin White, a Unity College student from Woolwich whose year of service will pay for one semester of school.
"I went clam digging once as a kid. Now I remember why I never did it again," White said, taking a break from digging a trench in the pungent mud. "Actually, it's a good change of pace from most of the work we do, building trails and other conservation projects, but I definitely prefer the woods. My major is outdoor recreation -- I don't think clam digging's going to catch on as recreation."

Abstract: [Sally Rier] and scores of other volunteers plan to dig their fingers deep into the muddy flats of Cobscook Bay on April 23 to reseed clam flats on the S-turn on South Lubec Road. The project is Lubec's part in the Americorps National Day of Service and will begin at 7:30 a.m. with a cleanup of the flats. "{The young clams} are anywhere from one-eighth-inch to one-half-inch, soft-shell clams that come from the Beals Island Shellfish Hatchery," Rier said. More than 200,000 seedlings will be taken to Cobscook Bay. In addition to community volunteers, members of the Cobscook Bay Clam Restoration Project and Americorps, others in the project include: the Lubec Shellfish Committee; Austin Dinsmore, manager of Stolt Sea Farms of Lubec; Hank Stence, research and development director at R.J. Peacock Canning and quality control officer for Maine Aqua Foods Inc.; the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery; and Victoria Dyer, town manager of Lubec.

Full text: LUBEC -- Sally Rier is a native of this small seaside community, but the closest she has ever been to clams was when they landed on her dinner plate.
But Rier and scores of other volunteers plan to dig their fingers deep into the muddy flats of Cobscook Bay on April 23 to reseed clam flats on the S-turn on South Lubec Road. The project is Lubec's part in the Americorps National Day of Service and will begin at 7:30 a.m. with a cleanup of the flats.
"{The young clams} are anywhere from one-eighth-inch to one-half-inch, soft-shell clams that come from the Beals Island Shellfish Hatchery," Rier said. More than 200,000 seedlings will be taken to Cobscook Bay.
"We are not going to seed them all. We are going to winter some in floating trays in the water," she said. In trays the clams grow larger before reseeding. The clams must be in the flats for three years before they grow to legal harvest size.
The Americorps project is expected to help volunteers understand the relationship among the environment, sustainable aquaculture practices and natural resource-based economic develop- ment.
Some of the goals of the project are to reverse environmental pollution, restore exhausted clam flats, demonstrate that communities and government can work together, and demonstrate how scientific research can benefit the economy.
During the past few years, several groups have focused on the economic benefits of reseeding clam flats in the area.
Other Americorps groups, working with area shellfish committees, will reseed clam flats in Scarborough and Waldoboro.
Members of Americorps met in March with Cobscook Bay area experts to learn about clam seedlings and the moon snails that feed on them. Clam seedlings have experienced a 100 percent mortality rate in areas with high numbers of moon snails.
A survey of the proposed reseeding sites in Lubec will be done later this week to make sure the seedlings will thrive.
Rier, a member of Downeast HealthCorps, a part of Americorps, described Americorps as the equivalent of a domestic Peace Corps. "Instead of going to other countries, we stay here and work in either rural or urban areas," she said.
In addition to community volunteers, members of the Cobscook Bay Clam Restoration Project and Americorps, others in the project include: the Lubec Shellfish Committee; Austin Dinsmore, manager of Stolt Sea Farms of Lubec; Hank Stence, research and development director at R.J. Peacock Canning and quality control officer for Maine Aqua Foods Inc.; the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery; and Victoria Dyer, town manager of Lubec.
The educational component of the project will be provided by Lubec teacher Martin Mahar. Pupils in his eighth-grade class will be taught about water quality testing and demonstrate on-site testing.
Rier said more volunteers are needed. For more information, call Rier at 733-5541, Ext. 152.

Dioxin commitment

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]13 Apr 1996: 1.

Abstract: About six months ago, Gov. Angus King directed the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, Ned Sullivan, to involve a range of interested parties to find ways to reduce dioxin discharges in Maine's rivers, with a long-term goal of eliminating these discharges from the state's paper mills. At a meeting Monday of business and environmental leaders, the governor announced that Maine's major paper mills had agreed to such a goal, although the agreement has no timetable for eliminating discharge of this toxin. What it does have, however, is an encouraging schedule that should continue the paper companies' recent record of significant dioxin-discharge reductions and give Maine better benchmarks to measure progress. Among the agreement's goals are the following: The state will create its own interim water-quality standard for dioxin. Currently, it uses the federal level, which has been the subject of intense debate and likely continued debate once the Environmental Protection Agency issues further guidance on this issue, as it is expected to do.

Full text: The agreement between Maine's bleached kraft paper industry and the state is not quite an absolute pledge to eliminate dioxin, but it is important for at least two reasons. It recognizes that the health of the rivers has a direct effect on the health of Maine's people, and it correctly observes changes in the papermaking industry worldwide that will continue to dramatically reduce or eliminate dioxin discharges.
Dioxin is a byproduct of incineration, wood and coal-burning and industrial processes that use chlorine. Trace amounts are found in dairy products, meats, fish and shellfish. Animals at the top of the food chain generally have the highest concentrations. High doses of dioxin cause chloracne, and may cause some types of cancers and bring on reproductive and development problems.
About six months ago, Gov. Angus King directed the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, Ned Sullivan, to involve a range of interested parties to find ways to reduce dioxin discharges in Maine's rivers, with a long-term goal of eliminating these discharges from the state's paper mills. At a meeting Monday of business and environmental leaders, the governor announced that Maine's major paper mills had agreed to such a goal, although the agreement has no timetable for eliminating discharge of this toxin. What it does have, however, is an encouraging schedule that should continue the paper companies' recent record of significant dioxin-discharge reductions and give Maine better benchmarks to measure progress. Among the agreement's goals are the following: The state will create its own interim water-quality standard for dioxin. Currently, it uses the federal level, which has been the subject of intense debate and likely continued debate once the Environmental Protection Agency issues further guidance on this issue, as it is expected to do.
Maine will continue its dioxin-monitoring program, which expires at the end of the current budget cycle, through the end of the decade.
The rivers in Maine will improve enough by 2000 for the Bureau of Health to remove a fish-consumption advisory for dioxin. The King administration may find achieving this goal difficult to verify. An advisory in Maine is issued for fish when dioxin levels exceed 1.5 parts per trillion. Background dioxin is 0.5 ppt, and there is some question about whether technology allows for scientists to make a distinction between these two points.
The DEP and the industry will use the resources of the Maine Science and Technology Foundation, the University of Maine and other organizations to find further ways to reduce dioxin discharges.
The reduced use of elemental chlorine in papermaking is certain to be central to further dioxin reductions. Some Maine mills have moved away from elemental chlorine to a process using chlorine dioxide. This latter process has much to recommend it, including the fact that the chemical compound can be produced on site and so doesn't require the transport of tankers carrying chlorine. It is also safer for workers at a mill in the event of a leak, and it can significantly reduce the level of dioxin discharges without requiring a mill to make extensive changes in its facilities, as other dioxin-reducing plans do. It does not, however, totally eliminate dioxin discharges.
Robert Huggett, science adviser to the EPA, said chlorine dioxide "is a solution to dioxin and other persistent, bio-accumulative, toxic substances in mill waste water."
As Maine moves toward its vision of cleaner rivers, it will face the question of how much it is willing to spend for incremental improvement. That, however, is a question for the future. What is encouraging now is that the state and Maine's mills have announced their commitment to cleaning the rivers.

Experts mull economic ills of fish farms Aquaculturists work to stem tides threatening state's industry

Author: Bruce Kyle Of the NEWS Staff

Abstract: Maine Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden opened the meeting with an update on the most crucial issue facing the industry -- the possibility that strains of wild salmon native to Downeast rivers could be placed on the federal endangered species list, a move most in aquaculture say would kill their industry. Since the primary concern of federal regulators is that huge numbers of cultured salmon escaping from their pens will drive out the much smaller numbers of wild strains or infect them with disease, a key element of the state's plan will be to construct weirs in the affected Washington and Hancock county rivers. The weirs will allow the state to better assess the migration of wild strains as they return to their spawning habitat and will allow cultured escapees to be culled from the weirs before they can go upriver. "This is a very ambitious new approach to salmon restoration, using aquaculture techniques to raise wild strains to adult stage for release into our depleted rivers," she said. "We have two hatcheries doing this now. A major issue is whether cultured strains will genetically swamp the wild strains, so this proposal is quite significant. If the wild salmon population goes up, the threat goes down."

Full text: EASTPORT -- Although the stated topic was the health of farmed fish, bacteria and parasites took a back seat at a conference Friday to the political and economic bugs threatening the health of Maine's fish farms.
The fourth annual New England Farmed Fish Workshop, held in the heart of Maine's $57 million salmon aquaculture industry, brought together more than 100 growers, state and federal managers and a panel of scientists for a discussion of the medical and regulatory issues facing the growing, but peril-filled industry.
Production at Maine's fish farms exploded last year to 22 million pounds, up from 14 million in 1994, with the value of the harvest jumping by $21 million. Aquaculturists, however, say the outlook isn't nearly as rosy as it seems, given the sharp drop in prices -- 30 percent in the last 18 months alone -- and their ongoing battles with cheap foreign competition, emerging diseases and unsympathetic federal regulators.
Maine Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden opened the meeting with an update on the most crucial issue facing the industry -- the possibility that strains of wild salmon native to Downeast rivers could be placed on the federal endangered species list, a move most in aquaculture say would kill their industry.
While a moratorium on new endangered-species listings gives the industry some breathing room -- at least until after the November election -- Alden said the state is using the reprieve to prepare a management plan it is hoped will convince federal regulators that farmed and wild salmon can coexist.
"A year ago, at this same conference, I said there was looming on the horizon the potential of this listing that would have extremely serious consequences for the industry," Alden said.
"Events have overtaken the federal process, leading to this moratorium. We don't know if this threatened listing will go forward, but as a state we are using the time to come up with an alternative, to develop a road map that will allow us to live under that listing."
Since the primary concern of federal regulators is that huge numbers of cultured salmon escaping from their pens will drive out the much smaller numbers of wild strains or infect them with disease, a key element of the state's plan will be to construct weirs in the affected Washington and Hancock county rivers. The weirs will allow the state to better assess the migration of wild strains as they return to their spawning habitat and will allow cultured escapees to be culled from the weirs before they can go upriver.
Alden said she is particularly excited about another part of the plan that will have the industry use some of its formidable hatchery capacity to raise wild strains to restock the rivers.
"This is a very ambitious new approach to salmon restoration, using aquaculture techniques to raise wild strains to adult stage for release into our depleted rivers," she said. "We have two hatcheries doing this now. A major issue is whether cultured strains will genetically swamp the wild strains, so this proposal is quite significant. If the wild salmon population goes up, the threat goes down."
With numerous government agencies concerned about aquaculture's impact on everything from wildlife to human health, and with the state's financial outlook as bleak as ever, Alden also cautioned the growers that the industry will have to use more of its own resources to solve its problems.
"The state's fish-health structure is not adequate to handle the explosion in aquaculture that's going on now, not just in fin fish, but in shellfish, urchins, eels, nori and so on," she said. "With the number of government commissions involved, there's a need for compromise, for a partnership between the industry, the state and the federal government. The state can never have the experts needed in salmon, eel and urchin pathology, so we need a collaborative effort."
According to Dana Stoffregen of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, industrywide collaboration throughout the United States and Canada is essential for aquaculture to get the research and medications it needs to thrive.
Stoffregen said the $600 million U.S. aquaculture industry, working in isolated pockets on both coasts and the Gulf states, makes up such a small piece of the agricultural pharmaceutical business that there are only two 20-year-old antibiotics federally approved for use in farmed fish, medicines that are increasingly unable to combat emerging diseases. Stoffregen said the $2.3 million spent annually to develop new medicines for food-product animals is less than one-third of what is spent on medicines for household pets.
Why pharmaceutical companies aren't spending more, he said, "is because aquaculture is too fragmented to attract their attention. It takes 11 years and $22 million to bring a new food-animal pharmaceutical to market. If the industry in this country and Canada would band together, form what I call a North American Salmon Federation, you could have the clout to market better, to have a better regulatory atmosphere and to capture the interest of the pharmaceutical industry."
On a positive note, Chris Heinig of MER Assessment Corp. of South Harpswell, which conducts the state's monitoring program for aquaculture sites, said data gathered since 1992 shows that improved industry practices, such as the shift from wet to dry feed, are leading to significant improvements in the impact salmon cages have upon the immediate ocean environment.

Abstract: What comprises a coastal garden? The answer lies in its theme: a garden that accentuates sea and shore: In Maine, the ubuiquitous lobster trap and buoy symbolize the rockbound coast. So do seagulls and lighthouses; Empty mussel and periwinkle shells layer the intertidal zone in almost harbor and along most headlands in Maine.

Full text: The idea originated, fittingly, in a Canadian province surrounded by the sea.
Outside a house on a side street in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, a garden composed with bleached scallop shells, driftwood, and a lobster buoy or two spreads across the narrow strip between foundation and sidewalk. Obviously drawn from materials common to PEI, the garden blends well with the miniature rock wall that lines the adjacent walk.
The American couple briefly glimpsed the coastal-oriented garden while en route to downtown Charlottetown. An idea instantaneously clicked; why couldn't they create a similar garden at their home in Maine?
Theme gardens
Many gardens reflect specific themes. Behind the Admiral Nimitz Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas, a lovely Japanese peace garden yanks the visitor half a world away to imperial Nippon. Its sand beds raked in the patterns evident at the Asticou Gardens in Northeast Harbor, its flowers and trees resembling the flora shot on-site for "Shogun," the garden invites a reflective stroll through its somnolent environs.
MDI's Asticou Gardens, so effectively utilizing the slightly sloped acreage sandwiched inside a Route 198 curve, blends Japanese design (the sand beds) and American functionality. Famous for its azaleas (there are people who will visit the gardens only when its azaleas bloom), Asticou incorporates native flora and topography (a pond, a brook, the slope from the road) to create an atmosphere that discourages loud noise and disruptive behavior.
A Brewer resident, the late Phyllis MacKinnon, maintained for some 40 years a rock garden that bloomed with tulips in the spring. She preferred the yellows and reds -- and planned her garden so something always bloomed until midsummer.
At their best, gardens emulate natural solitudes. The Charlottetown garden could not with its miniscule size. With this thought in mind, the Maine couple returned home via Cape Tormentine and the TransCanada to initiate their garden project.
Planning a coastal garden
What comprises a coastal garden? The answer lies in its theme: a garden that accentuates sea and shore: In Maine, the ubuiquitous lobster trap and buoy symbolize the rockbound coast. So do seagulls and lighthouses; Empty mussel and periwinkle shells layer the intertidal zone in almost harbor and along most headlands in Maine. Intact scallop shells are fairly rare finds; Shed by their former occupants, crab shells often wash ashore, as do dead starfish and empty urchin shells; Colorful rocks and granite chips carved by wave and erosion are abundant along the shore.
Elsewhere, the components can change: oyster shells along the Chesapeake, seashells along Caribbean shores. Large scallop shells, abraded white by surf and sand, litter the red sands of Prince Edward Island.
A coastal garden could incorporate all these materials, and even more, to create an effective theme. In true Yankee fashion, the Maine couple selected a frugal route to establishing their particular garden.
Where the dollar
makes a difference They agreed that any coastal garden in Maine must include a lobster trap -- and not just any trap. Only the traditional wood-slatted trap would suffice.
Intended for the tourist dollars, lobster traps built locally in Maine cost at least $20. Not so on Prince Edward Island, as the Maine couple discovered.
The morning after hatching their garden idea, they motored along the north shore, stopping at North Rustico to grab a sandwich. While approaching the town from the south, they had spotted a lighthouse, painted in the uniform white and red of most Canadian lighthouses, standing on the sandy spit guarding the west entrance to Rustico Bay.
Intrigued by the scenery, the Maine residents drove to the lighthouse (like so many on PEI, it must be approached on foot).
About 150 yards away, they went past several lobster traps stacked by a white picket fence.
A lobsterman's neat, well-maintained home, the couple agreed. Returning the same way, they noticed the "for sale" sign tacked to the lobster traps.
Four dollars, Canadian, was the asking price. With the exchange rate at 35 percent (as offered by the Irving Oil stations in Charlottetown), the price was about $2.60 American. The Maine residents dropped the appropriate coinage in a locked box nailed to the fence, stuffed a fresh lobster trap into their sedan, and headed for Cavendish.
Nature's bounty
The Maine couple spent that Saturday at Dalvay Beach, an incredible stretch of sand east of tourist-overrun Brackley Beach on the north shore. They caught some sun, swam in the warm ocean waters (nothing like the chill off Old Orchard Beach), and beachcombed.
Nature casts ashore on PEI a bounty seldom seen on the Maine coast. Scallop shells abound, sprinkled intact or shattered along the shore like salt spilled from a shaker. Within an hour, the Maine couple gathered enough scallop shells to outfit two coastal gardens.
Finding scallop shells proves difficult in Maine, where a rocky bottom and strong tides usually break empty shells. Mussel shells will suffice, though, as will periwinkle shells.
A local touch
Back in the States, the Maine residents designed their garden on paper. A lobster trap, no matter how positioned, sits low to the ground, so they bought a 6-foot length of picket fence, painted it white, and used it to backdrop the lobster pot.
Next, the couple shopped for fish nets and a lobster buoy. They found both, packaged for tourists, at a York Beach store.
The wife requested the garden be situated in the backyard, where she could see it from the kitchen-sink window. The coastal garden would be visible, but not blatantly so, from the road.
Unlike some gardens, this one was intended for the enjoyment of its architects, not passersby.
The couple prepared a 6-foot-by-2-foot bed by removing the underlying clay and replacing it with good dirt. They generously worked Maine-made bark mulch into the soil to reduce the weeds and retain moisture.
Then the homeowners braced the picket fence along the rear garden line and placed the lobster trap at a 45-degree angle to the fence. They draped the fish net from three spaced pickets, letting the mesh dangle over the fence and cover the trap.
To complete the effect, the couple hung the orange-and-white lobster buoy from a picket behind the lobster trap. They placed some scallop shells inside the trap and scattered others around it. The garden's final components were several small rocks found in MDI waters and various flowers planted to bloom by late summer.
The resulting garden, while not situated near salt water, brought a touch of the Maine coast to an inland yard.

Restoring old boats fills Pagels' sails Seaworthy vessels, saved from ramshackle state, fill eclectic Bar Harbor fleet

Abstract: Named after [Steve Pagels]' mother, the Natalie Todd is perhaps the fleet's flagship. The magestic white schooner, with its signature red sails, is a fixture in the waters around Mount Desert Island. While the ground is still frozen and snow remains in spots these April days, Pagels and other tour boat operators from Eastport to Kittery have begun the ritual of readying their vessels for the summer season. The buzz of sanders can be heard as crews prepare to paint. Rotten wood must be replaced, seams recaulked, gouges filled, stays, shrouds and other rigging checked, and a litany of other tasks performed. After being honorably discharged from the service, Pagels tried his hand at hardshell clamming in a gaff-rigged Muscongus Bay sloop -- the forerunner of the Friendship sloop -- on Great South Bay. He eventually landed his captain's license and divided his time between running a ferry hauling freight and garbage and taking people for cruises in the boats that by then made up his fleet, including a cat boat, a 1920s power boat and a two-masted sharpie schooner. Pagels credits Long Island boat builder Phil Shelton with introducing him to Maine. Shelton built for him the two-masted sharpie schooner before Shelton moved to Columbia Falls in the early 1980s. Seeing the potential for a tour boat business here, Pagels eventually also moved to Maine.

Full text: It began when he was in third grade. He remembers using roofing tar to caulk seams, and spending exactly $5 to put a fresh coat of paint on his first boat. He rowed for hours in that flat-bottomed sharpie, exploring the tidal marshes of Great South Bay off Long Island, N.Y.
More than 70 boats later, Capt. Steven Pagels, a Bar Harbor tour boat operator, is still restoring boats, only they have grown considerably in size from the 12-foot rowboat of his boyhood. The work today also involves more hands. His latest project is a replica of a 19th century merchant sailing ship named Young America, which is being rerigged as a two-masted topsail schooner.
There are scores of tour boat operators along the Maine coast. Their vessels range widely from launches to windjammers. But Pagels stands out because of his passion for resurrecting old working boats and for the sheer size and diversity of his Bar Harbor-based fleet, which boasts a circa 1923 Great Lakes ferry, a Chesapeake Bay-style oyster boat and three schooners.
Named after Pagels' mother, the Natalie Todd is perhaps the fleet's flagship. The magestic white schooner, with its signature red sails, is a fixture in the waters around Mount Desert Island. While the ground is still frozen and snow remains in spots these April days, Pagels and other tour boat operators from Eastport to Kittery have begun the ritual of readying their vessels for the summer season. The buzz of sanders can be heard as crews prepare to paint. Rotten wood must be replaced, seams recaulked, gouges filled, stays, shrouds and other rigging checked, and a litany of other tasks performed.
One recent raw, rainy day, Pagels drove to Southwest Harbor to see how work was progressing on his latest project. Young America, its deck stripped of masts and rigging, lay up against the wharf's weathered pilings. The graceful white and green schooner, not to be confused with the entry in last year's America's Cup Race, sported a resurfaced deck, new bulwarks and deckhouses.
In a boat shop at the head of the wharf, Columbia Falls carpenter Dwight Huntley worked alone. The radio kept him company as he constructed new companionway stairs for Young America. He has done the bulk of the work involved in restoring and converting the 19th century-style square rigger replica.
Two years ago, Young America lay in a derelict state in Historic Gardner's Basin in Atlantic City, N.J. The schooner had once served as a training ship and maritime mascot to the city's seafaring past. But it had been out of commission for years. Grass had grown knee-deep on its rotted deck. Pigeons were living below.
Pagels had had his eye on Young America for nearly two decades. The square rigger had raced against sailing ships from Denmark, Norway, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador and West Germany in the 1980 Tall Ships races. He had failed twice to acquire the ship. Its derelict state did not dissuade, and may have induced him to make a third, successful pitch in 1994.
"She was just a mess, but her hull was structurally sound," Pagels remembers. He had the brigantine towed by tugboat from Atlantic City to Southwest Harbor where most of his marine restoration projects are carried out. "We opened up the hatch and there were these two seasick-looking pigeons."
"She was kind of unhappy-looking," Huntley adds dryly. He should know, having hauled more than 12 tons of rotten wood and other debris out of the dilapidated ship.
Young America has had a complete face lift. Bar Harbor shipwright Jim Elk soon will construct the vessel's gaffs, booms and topmasts from spruce trees harvested Down East. Within the year, Pagels will be at the helm of the two-masted schooner, taking people for sails out and around the Porcupine Islands in Frenchman Bay.
Whether it's Young America or his Great Lakes ferry, the Chippewa, the crafts in Pagels' eclectic fleet have certain things in common. Nearly all were once working boats performing a wide range of functions from carrying herring harvested in the Gulf of Maine to ferrying passengers and freight to Mackinac Island on Lake Huron. Most were discovered in a ramshackle state and had to be brought back to life painstakingly.
Pagels is the first to admit he is powerless at the sight of an old working boat that has been left to waste away on the shore or in a field.
"A friend once told me `If you take to alcohol the way you do to boats,"' he related, "`you are going to be the world's worst alcoholic."'
Originally from Bayport, Long Island, Pagels was wheeling and dealing in boats by the sixth grade. The flat-bottomed sharpie was succeeded by a 10-foot fiberglass sailboat bought for $90. He had saved up the money from his paper route.
The sailboat enabled him to venture across Great South Bay. He transported the craft from his family's house to the beach on a "little red wagon" with a carpet on top.
"It was kind of funny," he said, chuckling. "My parents were not that strict if you wanted to go out on the water. But heaven help you if you got into someone's car."
After graduating from high school, Pagels enlisted in the U.S. Army and was sent overseas to Turkey where he worked in communications at a U.S. base overlooking the Bay of Izmit. He refurbished three boats including a racing sloop during his 1 1/2-year stint.
Back at Homestead Air Force base in Florida, the young communications officer quickly bought an old Bahamian sloop tied up to a wharf with a for-sale sign nailed to its mast.
After being honorably discharged from the service, Pagels tried his hand at hardshell clamming in a gaff-rigged Muscongus Bay sloop -- the forerunner of the Friendship sloop -- on Great South Bay. He eventually landed his captain's license and divided his time between running a ferry hauling freight and garbage and taking people for cruises in the boats that by then made up his fleet, including a cat boat, a 1920s power boat and a two-masted sharpie schooner.
Pagels credits Long Island boat builder Phil Shelton with introducing him to Maine. Shelton built for him the two-masted sharpie schooner before Shelton moved to Columbia Falls in the early 1980s. Seeing the potential for a tour boat business here, Pagels eventually also moved to Maine.
To showcase his boat-building skills, Shelton built an 1890s-style freight schooner, Janet May, that formed the basis for Pagels' fleet. The ship was launched ceremoniously on the Narraguagus River in Cherryfield.
The Janet May eventually was joined by the Natalie Todd. Formerly called the Lady in Blue, the schooner-dragger had fished the Grand Banks and Georges Banks for nearly half a century. Pagels found it languishing alongside a pier in Gloucester, Mass., "for sale" scribbled on the pilothouse.
"It's where the old fishing boats go to die. It's kind of a nautical skid row," he related, recalling the vessel's condition. "She had a million-dollar bottom and a 10-cent deck."
Pagels had the eastern-rigged dragger towed back to Maine where it was gutted down to a shell and transformed into the three-masted schooner Natalie Todd.
Four years later, Stinson Seafood Co.'s sardine carrier, Lou Ann, went aground in heavy fog on a ledge called the "Old Woman," and sank just outside Prospect Harbor. The vessel was raised and the herring salvaged the next day. But the canning company opted not to rebuild the heavily damaged wooden hull.
"She was like the queen of Stinson's fleet," said Pagels who resurrected the vessel and converted it into his two-masted topsail schooner, the Francis Todd, an amalgam of family names.
In his mid-40s, Pagels delights in describing how he chanced upon each and every one of the scores of vessels he has acquired since his very first boat, the flat-bottomed sharpie. Each encounter is still fresh in his mind.
It's that boyish quality that keeps him fired for the next project.
So what's it going to be? "It's always the old working boat hauled up on the marsh bank,"
he mused. "It's the old castoffs that I have such an affinity for."

Paper mills promise end to river toxins Goal is to stop dioxin discharge

Abstract: Seven Maine paper mills are committed to a course that would eliminate discharges of dioxin and other toxic chemicals into Maine rivers, according to Gov. Angus King. Dioxin and other toxic compounds are produced in minute amounts when wood pulp is bleached with chlorine. The chemicals pass through waste-water treatment systems and are released into Maine rivers where they enter the food chain. They are suspected of causing cancer, birth defects, and problems with the immune system. The seven Maine mills that use chlorine include James River Corp. in Old Town, Lincoln Pulp & Paper Co., Georgia-Pacific Corp. in Woodland, Boise Cascade Corp. in Rumford, International Paper Co. in Jay, and S.D. Warren Co. in Hinckley and Westbrook. Speaking to the group at the Falmouth headquarters of Maine Audubon Society, King announced several other initiatives to improve water quality, reduce the use of toxins, change forest practices, protect air quality, and clean up pollution. During the speech, the governor: Encouraged landowners and others to bring forward a plan that protects the health of Maine's forest without crippling its forest-based economy. "The age where we focus only on what we harvest is over," he said. "The age where we focus on the whole forest has begun."

Full text: Seven Maine paper mills are committed to a course that would eliminate discharges of dioxin and other toxic chemicals into Maine rivers, according to Gov. Angus King.
"I believe this is an unprecedented national move, and I applaud the mills for their responsible and proactive approach to this issue," King said Monday in a major address on the environment at a conference in Falmouth.
The commitment could cost the mills tens of millions of dollars, but there is no timetable for achieving the goal.
Under the two-page agreement between the state and the owners of the kraft paper mills, the companies agreed to a "long-term vision" of eliminating the discharge of dioxin and other pollutants. However, the agreement also states that any strategy for achieving that objective "must be developed with an acknowledgment of the global, national and inter-corporate context within which Maine mills must operate and compete."
According to the governor, the agreement to eliminate dioxin followed months of negotiations between representatives of the paper industry and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
"We share the belief that Maine's water quality should protect and allow the propagation and consumption of healthy fish, shellfish and wildlife," the mills said in a statement released by the DEP.
Dioxin and other toxic compounds are produced in minute amounts when wood pulp is bleached with chlorine. The chemicals pass through waste-water treatment systems and are released into Maine rivers where they enter the food chain. They are suspected of causing cancer, birth defects, and problems with the immune system. The seven Maine mills that use chlorine include James River Corp. in Old Town, Lincoln Pulp & Paper Co., Georgia-Pacific Corp. in Woodland, Boise Cascade Corp. in Rumford, International Paper Co. in Jay, and S.D. Warren Co. in Hinckley and Westbrook.
Jeff Nevins, communications manager at the Boise mill, called the commitment "a reasonable road map to deal with this issue." He said the industry had made no commitment to any specific technology for achieving the goal.
"It is up to individual mills to look at their processes," said Nevins. "We're hoping we can ... achieve the end result the governor wants and still be cost-efficient, given the competitive position the industry is in."
Dioxin has been found in fish, lobster tomalley and clams. For the past 10 years, Maine residents have been warned to limit their consumption of fish from parts of the Penobscot, Androscoggin, Kennebec and Presumpscot rivers. Women of child-bearing age first were advised not to eat lobster tomalley in 1994.
The Natural Resources Council of Maine has been a staunch advocate of ending the use of chlorine by paper mills. Everett "Brownie" Carson, executive director of the state's largest environmental organization, applauded the governor's speech.
"The word `eliminate' leaves no word for ambiguity," said Carson. "The governor wants to end fish advisories in the rivers by the year 2000."
Having spent the past year establishing solid credentials as a pro-business governor, King apparently has turned his attention to the protection of Maine's air, land and water.
"It's been a while coming, but it was a very strong, affirmative commitment {to environmental improvements}," said Carson.
Observers said the speech was well-received by participants at a forum called ECO/ECO, which stands for economy and ecology. First convened in 1990 at College of the Atlantic, the group includes businesspeople, academics, bureaucrats, and representatives of environmental organizations. They seek to find common ground for ensuring Maine's economic and environmental health.
Speaking to the group at the Falmouth headquarters of Maine Audubon Society, King announced several other initiatives to improve water quality, reduce the use of toxins, change forest practices, protect air quality, and clean up pollution. During the speech, the governor: Encouraged landowners and others to bring forward a plan that protects the health of Maine's forest without crippling its forest-based economy. "The age where we focus only on what we harvest is over," he said. "The age where we focus on the whole forest has begun."
Pledged that the state would meet the federal standard for ozone pollution by 1999 so Maine people "can breathe healthy air every day of the year." He repeated his call for the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to force Midwestern states to comply with the Clean Air Act to reduce the amount of pollution that drifts into Maine.
Promised to work with businesses to cut the use of toxins in half by the year 2000. He also ordered an inventory of environmental compliance and toxins used within state government, and demanded a plan to progressively reduce the use of dangerous chemicals.
Vowed to reduce the number of clam flats closed to harvesting by 10 percent, and to decrease by the same amount the number of lakes and ponds that aren't suitable for fishing or swimming.
Committed the state to closing 150 remaining unlicensed landfills and eliminating 20 million old tires by 2000, and cleaning up 1,500 sites contaminated with petroleum by 2005.
"With your help, we can achieve this vision, and Maine will be a better place for our children and their children's children,"
said King.

Abstract: A 73-map atlas that provides 80 types of geographic information for the coast from Baileyville to Machias Seal Island off Cutler, and along the coast of New Brunswick, will be unveiled later this month at a meeting sponsored by the St. Croix Estuary Project. Rob Rainer, a spokesman for the St. Croix Estuary Project, said the project began in 1993. He said the Charlotte-Washington County project mirrored a similar project in Nova Scotia. "It involves a large number of local people providing site-specific geographical information. They mapped that along with other information collected from government agencies," he said in a telephone interview Wednesday. The data for the atlas were collected in 1994 and 1995. In February, the St. Croix Estuary Project partners -- Eastern Charlotte Waterways, the West Isles Clean Environmental Association and Fisheries and Oceans Canada -- developed the atlas.

Full text: A 73-map atlas that provides 80 types of geographic information for the coast from Baileyville to Machias Seal Island off Cutler, and along the coast of New Brunswick, will be unveiled later this month at a meeting sponsored by the St. Croix Estuary Project.
The maps detail the coastal assets and resources of Charlotte County, New Brunswick, and a portion of Washington County, and include information about the coastal infrastructure, culture and tourism resources, and marine, estuarine and shellfish resources.
Rob Rainer, a spokesman for the St. Croix Estuary Project, said the project began in 1993. He said the Charlotte-Washington County project mirrored a similar project in Nova Scotia. "It involves a large number of local people providing site-specific geographical information. They mapped that along with other information collected from government agencies," he said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
Rainer said the coastal infrastructure that was mapped included wharfs, piers, herring weirs and lobster pounds. "Anything that people have built that are basically in the coastal environment," he said.
In the area of cultural and tourism resources, the group mapped everything that might be of interest to tourists, including museums and libraries. The marine, estuarine and shellfish resources included all recreational fish and shellfish resources, as well as some bird habitat.
The data for the atlas were collected in 1994 and 1995. In February, the St. Croix Estuary Project partners -- Eastern Charlotte Waterways, the West Isles Clean Environmental Association and Fisheries and Oceans Canada -- developed the atlas.
Rainer said that data included in the atlas would be available at the Calais Free Library and at libraries in Canada. He said reproductions of digital computer- generated maps and database information also would be available.
"With the digital project we will be able to call up various layers of information, and you will be able to see how one feature relates to another. From a planning point of view that is very important," he said.
"From an educational point of view, we feel the atlas and the digital products will be of value for schools. If they want to learn about what is in their back yard, this is sort of a one-stop shop for a lot of the information about what you have in your area," he said.
People interested in specific maps, Rainer said, also could draw information from the digital file. "We print specialized maps right off the laser printer and provide that information. That is the value of the digital product because it gives you real flexibility," he said.
The meeting to unveil the map is scheduled for 1 p.m. Monday, April 15, at the Stella Maris Community Center in Blacks Harbour, New Brunswick.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- The graying -- and widening -- of America -- are certainly having an impact on Maine producers, restaurateurs and innkeepers.
At the annual Maine Restaurant and Lodging Expo at the Augusta Civic Center this week, low-fat items and healthy foods were the trend: everything from organic yogurt to natural stone-ground mustards. Products grown and produced in Maine were a special hit.
The trade show Tuesday and Wednesday allowed people in the lodging and food businesses to meet each other, talk about and sample business trends, check out new and unique equipment and services, and even do a little marketing.
Clients are looking for no-fat, low-fat products, said Tom Snowman of Carl Smith Foods of Brewer. "Unfortunately, when you take out the fat and the calories, the price goes up," said Snowman.
"The biggest question I'm asked," said Stephanie Peavey of Great Eastern Mussel Farms, "is, `What is the calorie and fat content?"'
Although many of the suppliers offered healthy foods with fat-conscious consumers in mind, there was still an array of pizza vendors.
The mood was upbeat: With spring on the horizon, Maine businesses are looking ahead to a busy tourist season. But don't think they sat around idle all winter. Many of the Maine suppliers and producers at the trade show have been marketing themselves across the country, tying into the Internet and mail-order catalogs to promote Maine products nationwide.
Carol Tanner of Mother's Mountain of Falmouth, a mustard and sauce producer, was tempting inn and restaurant owners with an array of her products. She recently attended food shows in San Francisco, San Antonio and Boston. Maine products are instant hits, she said.
"People across the country find that Maine stands for quality and attention to detail," said Tanner. Tanner said she is constantly surprised at how many tourists tasted Maine-made specialties, then buy the products through mail orders. A secret to marketing within the state, she said, is local festivals such as the Common Ground Fair and the Maine Festival. "Let people taste your product. It's not as marketable just sitting on a shelf somewhere."
W.A. Bean of Bangor, the state's oldest independent meatpacker, has discovered that shoppers on the Internet are also looking for Maine products. Owner Elizabeth Bean Tommer said, "The Maine mystique is what out-of-state buyers are searching for." Tommer said her company has teamed with another Maine company, Raye's Mustard Mill in Eastport, to market hams and mustard, natural partners, together.
"We have teamed up because it makes more sense to market together," said Tommer. "It is unusual but perhaps is becoming more common."
Tommer said the Maine Department of Agriculture is extremely helpful in marketing strategies. Tommer said Bean's will be represented in the Maine pavilion in an upcoming food show in Pennsylvania. "We are just the type of company that needs their help," she said. "They are doing a really good job working with us."
Also represented at the show were the Maine Restaurant Association and the National Restaurant Association. Mike Carney, owner of Mr. Mike's Restaurant in Lincoln, is president of the MERA. He said Maine restaurants "are a growing market. In an industry where traditionally eight out of 10 fail within the first year, Maine restaurants are doing well because they adapt to change. It's a healthy industry."
"The restaurant industry has created more jobs in the past two years than any other industry," said Carney. "We have collected more sales tax than any other industry."
Carney said the greatest influence on Maine restaurants is the huge influx of restaurant corporations, such as Red Lobster and Olive Garden. "These chains are affecting our industry. This is not necessarily bad. We must adjust. Even supermarket salad bars affect us."
Carney said the greatest issue affecting all restaurants is the possible federal increase of the minimum wage. "I can't pay people $5.50 to dip ice cream," said Carney. He said the NRA and the MERA are lobbying against an increase.
At the trade show, national or regional distributors selling everything from tableware to giant mixers were represented. But at the heart of the show, in the center of the displays, the Agriculture Department had set up a special section: "Put Maine on Your Menu." The section promoted Maine products as diverse as mushrooms and sorbet.
"Food buyers know that visitors to Maine want to taste Maine, and they look for local products when they come to hike, sail, ski or simply relax," said the department's Judy Powell.
Featured as Maine producers were Oyster Creek Farm of Damariscotta, a mushroom producer; Maine Country Foods of Boothbay, seller of mussels, fish, lobster and shrimp bases, pates and bisques; Prima Gelati of Kennebunkport, offering fruit sorbets; Bean's of Bangor, hams and sausages; Mother's Mountain of Falmouth, mustards and sauces; the Wild Blueberry Association of North America; Humpty Dumpty Potato Chip Co. of South Portland; and Raye's Mustard Mill of Eastport.

Ardolino defense begins Witness says boys respectful, open

Abstract: [Matthew Ardolino] was voted "best dressed" boy by his fourth-grade classmates at the end of the academic year at the Harrington Elementary School, [Ann Roach] said. Her daughter, a classmate of Matthew's, was voted best-dressed girl, which is why she knew of the pair's honor, Roach said. The best-dressed award came about two weeks before Matthew died. Barry Frost, an Addison fisherman, said he saw nothing unusual occurring at the [Daniel Ardolino] household where he mowed the family's large lawn a couple of hours each day on June 25 and 26. Daniel and Matthew helped him clear away twigs and branches on June 25, he said. The boys also stood nearby the next afternoon as their father, a clammer and worm digger, skinned and fried eels. Frost said Ardolino spoke to Matthew when the child got grass stains on a new white T-shirt, but he denied the father was "hollering and screaming at his son." Asked by [Dan Lilley] if he saw any bruises on Matthew's arms or face or "anything that would make you want to call a doctor," Frost said, "I didn't see any problems, no."

Full text: BANGOR -- Matthew Ardolino and his older brother Daniel were respectful boys who attended church regularly in white shirts and ties with their father even after their mother left home with a younger brother and sister, said a defense witness Thursday in Robert Ardolino's murder trial.
Ann Roach of Harrington, a school counselor for Union 98, said she knew the Ardolino family between 1989 and 1993 in her role as religious education coordinator for the Holy Name Church, a Catholic parish in Machias.
"All four children were beautiful -- Daniel and Matthew and the two younger children. They were open and polite with me," recalled Roach, the second witness for the defense to take the stand Thursday afternoon.
Robert Ardolino is charged with murdering Matthew nearly three years ago.
Matthew was voted "best dressed" boy by his fourth-grade classmates at the end of the academic year at the Harrington Elementary School, Roach said. Her daughter, a classmate of Matthew's, was voted best-dressed girl, which is why she knew of the pair's honor, Roach said. The best-dressed award came about two weeks before Matthew died.
Asked by defense attorney Dan Lilley if the boys "ever seemed inhibited or afraid to talk," Roach said , "No, not with me."
"Did their father ever shelter them or pull them away by the nape of the neck," Lilley asked.
"No," Roach replied.
Roach was one of several people who painted a picture of the Ardolino household starkly different from the one portrayed by prosecution witnesses in the first 6 1/2 days of the trial.
Matthew Ardolino died around midnight on Sunday, June 27, 1993, said Dr. Kristin Sweeney, the state's deputy chief medical examiner. He lay dead in the living room of the family home in Harrington for about four hours before Daniel, then 11, discovered his body, according to court testimony.
Autopsy results revealed the cause of death was peritonitis caused by a ruptured small intestine. Prosecutors claim the boy's fatal injury was the result of blows from his father. Robert Ardolino claims he is innocent of wrongdoing and that his son was fatally injured in a fall from a tree. Ardolino is standing trial on charges of depraved indifference, murder and manslaughter.
Afternoon testimony contrasted with the morning session when Maine State Police witnesses for the prosecution withstood repeated attempts by Lilley to discredit their tactics.
Retired State Police Detective Robert Cameron repeatedly denied he had investigated the case in a way that would justify a murder charge. Lilley attacked a three-hour interview Cameron and another detective had conducted with Daniel Ardolino on July 2, 1993.
"Let's lay our cards on the table," Lilley said. "The purpose of that interview -- you were trying to get Daniel to change his story, {to say} that the treehouse, it didn't happen.
"No," Cameron said.
A blow to the defense came shortly before noon when a forensic chemist at the Maine State Police laboratory testified that fibers collected on the ground under a treehouse on the Ardolino property "were not consistent" with the clothing Matthew Ardolino reportedly was wearing the day he died.
Early Thursday afternoon Assistant Attorney General William Stokes rested the state's case, and the defense took over. Five witnesses for the defense took the stand, describing Ardolino as a responsible father who showed his sons the work skills and the morality by which he survived.
Dr. Laurie Ludington, a Calais family-practice physician, said she found "no characteristic pattern of physical abuse," when she examined Daniel Ardolino on June 28, 1993, the day after his brother's death. The child had been brought in for an examination by a Department of Human Services caseworker less than 24 hours after he had been removed from his father's care by the state.
Ludington noted Daniel had a few scrapes, bruises and abrasions on parts of his body but they were "all typical and there were not a large number," she said.
Daniel's "affect" -- his emotions and self expression -- were calm and normal the day after his brother died. "I felt that was unusual under the circumstances," Ludington said.
Barry Frost, an Addison fisherman, said he saw nothing unusual occurring at the Ardolino household where he mowed the family's large lawn a couple of hours each day on June 25 and 26. Daniel and Matthew helped him clear away twigs and branches on June 25, he said. The boys also stood nearby the next afternoon as their father, a clammer and worm digger, skinned and fried eels.
Frost said Ardolino spoke to Matthew when the child got grass stains on a new white T-shirt, but he denied the father was "hollering and screaming at his son." Asked by Lilley if he saw any bruises on Matthew's arms or face or "anything that would make you want to call a doctor," Frost said, "I didn't see any problems, no."
Albion Kenney Sr. of Harrington, a shellfish conservation warden, said he had once gotten out of his truck to break up a "scrap" between the older Ardolino brothers. "I was about 50 yards from their home. Daniel had a stick and was chasing Matthew. I said, `Quit your fighting boys or you're gonna get hurt.' "
Under aggressive questioning from attorney Stokes, Earl Tyler Jr., a lawyer, said he was "instrumental" in getting Robert Ardolino to file sexual abuse charges against his ex-wife. The charges allegedly involved Matthew and Daniel Ardolino, but were never substantiated.
Tyler represented Robert Ardolino in an acrimonious divorce from Nan Ardolino. "I told him to be as aggressive as necessary" to get DHS and court records involving the allegations, Tyler said.
"Did that include making false allegations against the mother and the grandfather?" Stokes asked.
"Not to my knowledge. I believe them to be true," Tyler said.
Terming the session a "very good day for the defense," attorney Lilley said a key witness Friday will be Dr. Stephen Dunton, an Atlanta medical examiner.

Stewards of land must act in Maine

Abstract: The multinational forest product industries must be held accountable to the people of Maine for their collectibe actions because have a contract with the people of Maine and are allowed to operate here. Property rights do not extend to biological devastation of whole ecosystems and the pollution of our collective coastal waters. In light of these serious problems, I suggest, in conjunction with the clear-cutting referendum, that the people of Maine initiate a "dioxin referendum" which would require that the responsible parties clean up the rivers of dioxin by the year 2002, although even this is not soon enough (remember DDT, that legacy lives on). The dioxin issue is one of the most serious pollution issues we face in Maine.

Full text: I am writing in response to a letter published Feb. 29 in the Bangor Daily News, titled, "Maine Green Party." The author first suggests that the Green Party's proposed clear-cutting referendum would "seriously harm all forest product industries in northern Maine, putting a lot of them out of business and severely reducing the size of other operations in an area of the state where trees are the biggest natural resource."
Let's look at some realities: From 1970 to 1990 total employment in the forest products industry of the northern forest states fell by 13 percent (almost 17,000 jobs). At the current rate of nonsustainable clear-cutting forestry practices this trend is predicted to continue -- despite a clear-cut referendum. (See "The Northern Forest Strategies for Sustainability," by Spencer R. Phillips, The Wilderness Society, 1993.)
Clear-cutting is just one of the nonsustainable events in the northern forest. Another more devastating long-term problem associated with the forest products industry is dioxin pollution. Fish and lobster eaters beware -- there are at least 75 different dioxins known to cause cancer and many are found in high concentrations in all waters below every one of the seven bleach kraft mills. Look at this figure: One paper company last year reported $240 million in profits. That is an amazing number of polluted lobsters, fish and shellfish for which they are responsible. The out-of-state stockholders are ecstatic, while the people of Maine and their freshwater and marine ecosystems have a serious pollution problem. The "closed-loop" technology to clean up the dioxins and other associated pollutants (and there are many) cost approximately $50-$60 million for a typical mill. That still leaves this one paper company a cool $180 million profit; a small price for these multi-national corporations to pay for a cancer-free nonpolluted environment. And that $50-$60 million is nothing compared to the long-term billions lost when our lobster markets are lost and the tourism dollars from sport fishing dry up. (Washington County already is feeling that blow to its "already fragile economy".)
The forest products industry is pulling the wool over the eyes of all Mainers and has our legislators in their back pockets. They are raping this beautiful state of our natural resources and selling them abroad to their multi-national partners while publicly claiming that all is "well in the hands of a paper company."
Hogwash! The forest products industry must be responsible stewards of the lands they use and the public waterways into which they dump their non-profit waste. They must stop seeking high short-term returns by selling valuable land for development rather than keeping it for sustainable timber management. The urbanization of Maine must stop. We need sustainable forestry practices, we need wilderness areas and the people of Maine must demand them before it is too late.
The multinational forest product industries must be held accountable to the people of Maine for their collectibe actions because have a contract with the people of Maine and are allowed to operate here. Property rights do not extend to biological devastation of whole ecosystems and the pollution of our collective coastal waters. In light of these serious problems, I suggest, in conjunction with the clear-cutting referendum, that the people of Maine initiate a "dioxin referendum" which would require that the responsible parties clean up the rivers of dioxin by the year 2002, although even this is not soon enough (remember DDT, that legacy lives on). The dioxin issue is one of the most serious pollution issues we face in Maine.
Fish and lobster should not be eaten from any waters with bleach kraft mills on them. This has dire monetary consequences for the fishing industry in particular and the ecotourism industry in general. The lobster and shellfish industry could be destroyed if this issue is not dealt with soon. Talk about job loss and billions in lost revenue! All for $50-$60 million? Real stewards of the land would see the long-term benefits of making this very small investment for future Maine generations.
It has been approximately 100 years since the Industrial Revolution began. In the 1970s we started to understand how chemical pollutants caused cancer and today we are beginning to understand that these pollutants trigger molecular events which lead to uncontrolled cell growth (i.e., cancer). The forest products industries must use this scientific knowledge by implementing socially responsible practices within the industry. If the forest products industry does not care about our great state than it is up to groups like the Green Party and others dedicated to a viable future to propose referendums that do so.
Maine people must not look naively and narrow-mindedly at the future nor must we believe every word spoken by the leaders of the forest products industry. Together, we can create "viable alternative jobs at decent wages" with a diverse economy. Together, we can make Maine the envy of all Americans.

Abstract: Clams get no respect, according to Bob Cummings of Phippsburg, who spoke at "clam day" at the Samoset Resort during the opening day of the Maine Fishermen's Forum. With state landings at $11 million, trailing only lobster, salmon and urchins, the clam industry is struggling to develop a stronger voice and badly needed controls, including a model clam ordinance. The clam industry is working to develop a Maine Clam Council and Clam Harvester's Association, organizations that the other fisheries have enjoyed for decades.

Full text: ROCKPORT -- Clams get no respect, according to Bob Cummings of Phippsburg, who spoke at "clam day" at the Samoset Resort during the opening day of the Maine Fishermen's Forum.
Levels for clam contamination accepted by government regulators date to the southern oyster fishery a few generations ago.
The standards are too high, he said. "There is not a shred of research to support these levels. If the same standards were applied to hamburgers or chicken, those industries would disappear," Cummings said.
Clams are no more dangerous to eat than eggs, he said.
This year's Fishermen's Forum featured an entire "clam day" Thursday. State Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden said she could remember when the weekend forums never even discussed clams.
With state landings at $11 million, trailing only lobster, salmon and urchins, the clam industry is struggling to develop a stronger voice and badly needed controls, including a model clam ordinance. The clam industry is working to develop a Maine Clam Council and Clam Harvester's Association, organizations that the other fisheries have enjoyed for decades.
With many clam flats devastated, local communities are starting to realize that it is up to them, not state officials, to protect the valuable resource. Many communities are taking a regional approach to protecting river and seashore beds through tougher regulations that protect the resource while controlling out of town diggers.
The town of Perry voted 55-5 recently to support a budget for a clam program. Eastport is turning off every other streetlight to raise money for a clam program.
It was suggested that a state bond, license fees or landing fees could be imposed to support conservation and protection pro- grams.

Economy on mend in Waldo County Area will survive loss of Sears Island

Abstract: The news this week that Gov. Angus King is mothballing the Sears Island cargo port because of expensive environmental regulations cast a cloud over Waldo County. But even without the economic boost the port would have brought, the area's economic fortunes have been improving. As people pinned their hopes on Sears Island, things got worse. In rapid succession the county's shoe and poultry industries collapsed. First it was Maplewood Poultry and 600 jobs, next it was Waldo Shoe, with 200 jobs, then Penobscot Poultry with 500 jobs, and finally Truitt Bros. More than 100 poultry farm families scattered throughout the county also lost their livelihoods. There were no eel grass beds on the Long Cove side of Sears Island in 1983, the year the causeway from the mainland was built and unemployment in Waldo County reached 12.7 percent. But once the causeway was in place, the eel grass habitat expanded into the cove and attracted shellfish and spawning groundfish.

Full text: SEARSPORT -- The news this week that Gov. Angus King is mothballing the Sears Island cargo port because of expensive environmental regulations cast a cloud over Waldo County. But even without the economic boost the port would have brought, the area's economic fortunes have been improving.
"We felt it was a natural thing for the area," recalled Larry Quinn, who managed a branch bank in Belfast when Sears Island looked promising, "It seemed at that time to be an economic shot in the arm during a time when we were looking at a pretty damn dismal economy."
The late 1970s and early 1980s was an era of 20 percent interest rates and 17 percent inflation. Unemployment throughout northern Maine was high, but Waldo County, home of Sears Island, not only was the poorest county, it also had the highest rate of unemployed at around 12 percent.
As people pinned their hopes on Sears Island, things got worse. In rapid succession the county's shoe and poultry industries collapsed. First it was Maplewood Poultry and 600 jobs, next it was Waldo Shoe, with 200 jobs, then Penobscot Poultry with 500 jobs, and finally Truitt Bros. More than 100 poultry farm families scattered throughout the county also lost their livelihoods.
Although many of the lost jobs were of the low-paying, semiskilled or piecework variety, the removal of those payrolls from the community had a ripple effect on the area's small businesses. A number of small markets and stores were forced to close their doors.
The more things got worse, the more the Sears Island cargo port was being looked to as a beacon of hope.
There were no eel grass beds on the Long Cove side of Sears Island in 1983, the year the causeway from the mainland was built and unemployment in Waldo County reached 12.7 percent. But once the causeway was in place, the eel grass habitat expanded into the cove and attracted shellfish and spawning groundfish.
It also attracted defenders. The focus on Sears Island began to turn to ecology, rather than the economy.
Then, when it appeared that the major export would be wood chips, even longtime port supporters such as labor unions began to waiver. The thought of Maine trees being chipped and shipped overseas to foreign paper mills only added to what was becoming more and more an emotional environmental issue.
Today, the county's unemployment rate hovers around 9 percent, -- still the highest in Maine -- but hope is on the horizon. The Belfast region has been rebounding from its staggering job losses even without the Sears Island project.
The old Waldo Shoe building is now home to a number of small businesses, the Truitt Bros. building has been refurbished and expanded by the wood products firm Matthews Bros., and the Maplewood Poultry plant has been taken over by potato processor Penobscot Frozen foods. The crumbling hulk of the Penobscot Poultry plant may still hover over the city's waterfront, but the grain mill at the foot of Main Street is long gone.
The most spectacular news has been the arrival of MBNA New England. The credit card firm is building an office complex in the city and expects to have 1,000 employees working there within the next two years. Whether that and other developments will be enough to boost Waldo County's unemployment rate out of the cellar remains to be seen.

Full text: JONESPORT -- Slippery road conditions and speed were blamed in the death of a 23-year-old Jonesport man late Wednesday night when his car careened off Route 187 and struck a cluster of large hardwood trees.
Police said Patrick R. Cirone, a native of South Addison, was driving his 1992 Ford Mustang convertible north at 11 p.m. on the Sandy River Beach side of the Route 187 loop when he lost control on a long patch of black ice and skidded 442 feet out of control. The car then spun around and traveled backward another 149 feet before leaving the highway and slamming sideways into a large maple tree. The driver's side door of the car hit the tree.
Cirone died of head injuries at the accident scene before help arrived. The ice was sanded after the accident.

Ellsworth city councilors approve $9,100 for design of compost facility

Abstract: Ellsworth city councilors authorized Ellsworth City Manager Tim King to spend $9,100 on the engineer's design for the facility, which would be built on several acres of city land near the Ellsworth transfer station off Route 1A. Those funds will also cover the cost of applying for a Maine Department of Envionmental Protection license for the composting operation. Ellsworth currently sends the bulk of its waste to be incinerated at Penobscot Energy Recovery Co.'s Orrington facility. This year, the city is paying just over $27 per ton to dispose of its waste at PERC. But city officials fear their tipping fees may be boosted substantially next year. Besides the disposal costs at PERC, Ellsworth is also spending $20,000 annually to truck sludge from its waste-water treatment plant to Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.'s Hawk Ridge facility in western Maine.

Full text: ELLSWORTH -- Ellsworth officials Monday night authorized hiring an engineer to design a compost facility where sludge from the city's waste-water treatment plant and other material would be composted. The operation is seen as a means to further reduce the city's solid waste disposal costs.
Ellsworth city councilors authorized Ellsworth City Manager Tim King to spend $9,100 on the engineer's design for the facility, which would be built on several acres of city land near the Ellsworth transfer station off Route 1A. Those funds will also cover the cost of applying for a Maine Department of Envionmental Protection license for the composting operation.
King estimated the facility would cost between $30,000 and $50,000 to construct. The operation would largely consist of an asphalt pad where compost material would be heaped. A subsurface drain would be built to collect any leachate.
The city manager did not foresee any problems in obtaining a DEP permit.
"All indications are that they {the DEP} think it's a good site and there are no problems," he said.
After construction is completed, King said a private firm with expertise in a municipal composting operation would be hired to run the facility at an annual cost of $10,000. He said that entity would share revenue generated from the composted material's sale. He said a fee would be charged any other communities disposing of their sludge at the Ellsworth site.
"In essence, the operation would be self-supporting as far as the city is concerned," King said.
Gary Fortier, a councilor and Solid Waste Committee chairman, said the project holds promise for reducing the city's solid waste costs. He said sludge, shellfish waste, chipped wood, wet cardboard and wet newsprint are among the materials that could be composted.
"We can compost our sludge instead of spending $20,000 to take it to Hawk Ridge," he said.
Ellsworth currently sends the bulk of its waste to be incinerated at Penobscot Energy Recovery Co.'s Orrington facility. This year, the city is paying just over $27 per ton to dispose of its waste at PERC. But city officials fear their tipping fees may be boosted substantially next year.
Six years ago, Ellsworth was one of eight Maine towns that balked when PERC moved to amend its contracts with 95 Maine communities. In some of the amended contracts, tipping fees would have shot up as much as fourfold.
Dubbed the "Refuseniks," Ellsworth and the seven other towns refused to pay the proposed fees and threatened PERC's owners with a $9 million breach of contract lawsuit. PERC and the Refusenik towns eventually reached an agreement setting tipping fees for a five-year period that expires in 1997.
Besides the disposal costs at PERC, Ellsworth is also spending $20,000 annually to truck sludge from its waste-water treatment plant to Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.'s Hawk Ridge facility in western Maine.
In recent years, Ellsworth has made strides in reducing the amount of trash being incinerated at PERC. The city recycled about 25.5 percent of its waste last year. City officials also imposed a $1-per-bag trash disposal fee and began offering curbside collection of recyclables last summer. Since then, participation in the recycling program has risen 2 percent.

Abstract: Ellsworth city councilors next Monday night are scheduled to discuss possible construction of a compost facility. Maine Shellfish Co.'s waste, much of it clam and shrimp shells, the waste-water treatment plant's sludge, yard and eventually food and blueberry waste would be processed there. The compost would be sold as a way further to reduce the city's solid waste disposal costs. Ellsworth has already made significant strides in reducing the volume of solid waste sent to PERC. After the city imposed a $1-per-bag trash disposal charge and began offering curbside collection of recyclables last summer, participation in its recycling program rose 2 percent. The city recycled about 25.5 percent of its waste last year. Still, Ellsworth continues to send the bulk of its waste to PERC. The city paid a tipping fee of $26.44 per ton last year and is paying just over $27 per ton this year. The city is also spending thousands of dollars to send sludge from the waste water treatment plant to Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.'s Hawk Ridge facility in western Maine.

The compost would be sold as a way further to reduce the city's solid waste disposal costs.
The city would build an asphalt pad, surrounded by a 6- to 8-foot chain-link fence, on a parcel of city land across Boggy Brook Road from the transfer station off Route 1A. It would contract a firm with expertise in mixing and handling compost.
"We are continuing to look at the tonnage of waste we produce and what we can do instead of shipping it to PERC. This was the next logical step to look at," said Ellsworth Councilor Gary Fortier on Tuesday. He heads the city's solid waste committee.
Fortier said Ellsworth's tipping fees could go up next year when the city and seven other Maine towns' five-year contract with PERC expires. Six years ago, Ellsworth was one of eight Maine towns that balked at the Orrington company's move to amend its contracts with 95 Maine communities.
In some of the amended contracts, PERC's tipping fees would have shot up as much as fourfold. Dubbed the "Refuseniks,"
Ellsworth and the seven other towns threatened PERC's owners with a $9 million breach of contract lawsuit. PERC and the Refusenik towns eventually reached an agreement setting tipping fees for a five-year period that expires in 1997.
Ellsworth has already made significant strides in reducing the volume of solid waste sent to PERC. After the city imposed a $1-per-bag trash disposal charge and began offering curbside collection of recyclables last summer, participation in its recycling program rose 2 percent. The city recycled about 25.5 percent of its waste last year.
Still, Ellsworth continues to send the bulk of its waste to PERC. The city paid a tipping fee of $26.44 per ton last year and is paying just over $27 per ton this year. The city is also spending thousands of dollars to send sludge from the waste water treatment plant to Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.'s Hawk Ridge facility in western Maine.
Fortier believes a compost facility has potential to further reduce the city's solid waste disposal costs.
"This plan, if it works, will be able to take all of our sludge and seafood waste," he said.
Bar Harbor has had a municipal compost facility since the 1970s. The town composts its own sludge as well as Southwest Harbor's and sells the material for $24.57 per cubic yard to landscapers. Last year it cost $22.33 per cubic yard to run the facility, according to Bar Harbor Town Manager Dana Reed.
"It's definitely worthwhile. It's a lot cheaper than hauling it away," Reed said Wednesday. He said some neighbors have complained about foul odors, but it has not been determined whether the smell is coming from the compost facility or another source.
In Ellsworth, Maine Shellfish Co.'s plant manager Stephen Beathem estimates his company produces roughly 30 tons of clam and shrimp shells per year.
"It's a sought-after commodity because it contains trace elements that enhance the end product," he said Wednesday. A city councilor, he supports the idea of a compost facility. "I've always been an advocate of doing anything to reduce our solid waste costs."

Full text: PORTLAND -- An organization that cleans up oil spills in Portland Harbor is studying last month's 828,000-gallon spill off Rhode Island in hopes it will lead to improvements in local emergency plans.
"It really highlighted for us the importance of the work we've been doing, and the need to keep that in focus," said John M. Ferland, general manager of Clean Casco Bay Inc.
Ferland's organization, which has a fleet of five boats and a warehouse filled with skimmers, containment booms and other cleanup gear, is the first line of defense against oil spills in Portland Harbor, where 500 oil barges and tankers transfer 100 million barrels a year.
Ferland's organization, trained to respond in less than two hours, is funded by six marine terminal operators. Another industry-funded group, Marine Spill Response Corp., is responsible for open water spills in Casco Bay.
The Coast Guard and state Department of Environmental Protection also have emergency response programs.
Ferland and two staff members traveled to Rhode Island soon after the spill to visit the site where a barge ran aground, spilling 828,000 gallons of heating oil into Block Island Sound.
He expressed special interest in how authorities coped with stormy weather and adjusted their cleanup strategies to protect birds, shellfish and other wildlife.
"Clearly, we're going to have a wildlife impact up here" if a spill occurs, he said. "And it's not going to take 800,000 gallons to do it."
Ferland said he and his staff associates plan to review lessons learned from their observations in Rhode Island.

Word from bridge: Look out! Chamberlain span between Brewer and Bangor losing concrete

Abstract: On a scale of 1 to 9, with 9 being considered brand new, the bridge's deck rates a 3, according to Gary Hoar, an assistant bridge maintenance engineer with the MDOT. The remainder of the bridge, its superstructure, however, rates a 6, based on a review by the MDOT a year ago. A score of 4 is considered federally as the level requiring some kind of intervention or review, Hoar explained. The $4.4 million project has been funded but shelved for several years, according to the MDOT officials, because up river is the old Bangor-[Brewer] bridge, which rates a 2 in terms of its deck and superstructure. That bridge is also called the Penobscot Bridge. Heavy-load traffic has been banned from that bridge, which also connects Bangor with Brewer. In August, the weight prohibition forced an ambulance carrying a shooting victim to add a mile to its trip to the hospital by crossing the Joshua Chamberlain Bridge.

Full text: Phil Reid used to park his car underneath the Joshua Chamberlain Bridge before heading into Bangor's Sea Dog brew pub for a meal. Not anymore.
Friday morning, while delivering 30 pounds of lobsters to the Sea Dog from Young's Shellfish in Belfast, he watched as a 10-inch chunk of concrete dropped from the bridge just after a Rite Aid tractor-trailer rumbled by above.
"That's where I used to park," Reid recalled with a start as he watched the concrete fall harmlessly into an open space reserved by the city of Bangor for permit parking.
Curious, he left the loading dock, approached the spot and scanned the bridge above.
"I saw there was a bigger chunk up there and got the hell out of there," he said.
Such an episode is not surprising to state transportation officials, who caution that the advanced age of the bridge's decking -- it was built in 1955 -- makes it a prime candidate for cracks, holes and fragmenting concrete.
The warning to pedestrians and motorists: Watch out.
"That's going to happen periodically because the deck is in such bad condition," said Norman Baker, assistant bridge design engineer for the Maine Department of Transportation.
While still strong enough to support traffic and trucks, the bridge's underbelly is pockmarked with indentations, exposing the corroding steel used to reinforce the concrete.
On a scale of 1 to 9, with 9 being considered brand new, the bridge's deck rates a 3, according to Gary Hoar, an assistant bridge maintenance engineer with the MDOT. The remainder of the bridge, its superstructure, however, rates a 6, based on a review by the MDOT a year ago. A score of 4 is considered federally as the level requiring some kind of intervention or review, Hoar explained.
To prevent some concrete from falling, the MDOT has attached plywood to exposed concrete on the sides, where there is support to keep the wood in place. But Baker said unless holes develop from top to bottom, significant repairs aren't expected until the entire deck is replaced in 1998.
The $4.4 million project has been funded but shelved for several years, according to the MDOT officials, because up river is the old Bangor-Brewer bridge, which rates a 2 in terms of its deck and superstructure. That bridge is also called the Penobscot Bridge.
Heavy-load traffic has been banned from that bridge, which also connects Bangor with Brewer. In August, the weight prohibition forced an ambulance carrying a shooting victim to add a mile to its trip to the hospital by crossing the Joshua Chamberlain Bridge.
The replacement for the old Bangor-Brewer bridge, costing taxpayers about $13 million and increasing traffic capacity from two lanes to four, is expected to be completed in the fall of 1997.
With an average of 65,000 people traversing one of the three Bangor-Brewer bridges each day, Baker said it wouldn't be feasible to have both bridges under construction at the same time.

Abstract: [Bob Jacques] says Maine's smaller-scale specialty food producers tend to do things a little differently, showing up at his store unannounced, say, with a baby in tow, maybe just to say hello or to drop off some products for sampling. The personal connection Jacques forges with some is a remnant of days gone by, he says. Although products from The Mex are for sale in at least two other of the chain's stores, nowhere but in Augusta are they grouped in a Maine display, which makes a huge difference, she says. "I tend to think we're aiming at people interested in Southwestern food, but lots of people are interested just in Maine-made foods." Mike Demers of the state Department of Economic and Community Development is out to do just that. Jacques credits him and Dennis Proctor of the Maine Food Processors Association for much of the behind-the-scenes work that has helped keep the Maine-made food display going.

Full text: Unofficially, state Rep. Jill Goldthwait has thrown her support behind it. When she drives to Augusta from Bar Harbor, it's the first place she shops.
The display between aisles 5 and 6 at the Whitten Road Shop 'n Save there has become a pit stop for all manner of shoppers, who can pick and choose from among several shelves of items provided by 50 Maine specialty food producers.
Death by Chocolate made in Damariscotta is available, as are Wicked Wild Preserves from Edgecomb, and Maine Coast Sea Vegetables from Franklin. The range of producers represented spans much of the Maine map, especially coastal sections from south of Freeport through to Eastport on the Canadian border.
While some of the items are available at other selected Shop 'n Save stores, many are not. You can find stone-ground mustard here, beer, mustard made with beer, a multitude of jams and sauces, syrups, soups, soup mixes, baked goods and candy, and, appropriately, toothpaste.
Still in its infancy, the 7-week-old Maine-made products section was the brainchild of a department manager last Thanksgiving.
"This area's been hit by a rough economy," notes the display's coordinator, nonperishables manager Bob Jacques, "so we were looking for ways to increase sales."
Intended as a temporary display for the holidays, the popular diversion is beginning to look like a permanent fixture. In fact, moving the display from one part of the store to another touched off a mild panic, recalls Jacques. "You're not taking it down, are you?" customers demanded to know.
The Maine-made section made sense for the centrally located Augusta store, which in summer draws tourists and campers from the lakes surrounding the city, and in winter skiers headed to the western mountains. The Shop 'n Save owes much of its in-store traffic to its location just off the interstate.
For Jacques, an amiable Waterville native whose 30-year supermarket career began when he was 15, the fledgling Maine-made food venture has generated excitement for him, as well as for the food producers and the store's customers.
"Everything to do with these Maine products is pretty unique," says Jacques, for whom procuring the specialty foods is a huge departure from his normal routine.
Huge operations such as the Shop 'n Save supermarket chain, which is owned by Hannaford Bros. typically deal in high-volume shipments ordered by computer, and often delivered by strangers.
Jacques says Maine's smaller-scale specialty food producers tend to do things a little differently, showing up at his store unannounced, say, with a baby in tow, maybe just to say hello or to drop off some products for sampling. The personal connection Jacques forges with some is a remnant of days gone by, he says.
Co-owner of The Ampersand Store in Orono since November, Roberta Bradson browsed the section recently, saying she was impressed by the diversity of products. One favorite find was the dried mushrooms sold by Oyster Creek of Damariscotta. Her own Nilsdotter brand soup mixes have sold well since their inclusion in the display, she says.
A former nurse, Sandy Wardwell co-owns The Mex restaurant in Ellsworth with her husband, Bruce. The Mex sells five of its products through the Augusta store, including hot sauce and black bean soup.
"We've dealt with Hannaford Brothers for well over 10 years. They have a good heart for Maine companies," says Wardwell.
Although products from The Mex are for sale in at least two other of the chain's stores, nowhere but in Augusta are they grouped in a Maine display, which makes a huge difference, she says. "I tend to think we're aiming at people interested in Southwestern food, but lots of people are interested just in Maine-made foods."
Maria Savoy of Marika's Kitchen in Gouldsboro says that initially she was intimidated upon approaching Hannaford Bros. to sell her product, Laura's Scottish Shortbread. "But my experience was they were encouraging and wonderful," says Savoy.
She calls the Augusta store's new initiative a "really nice opportunity to expose other people to the products, and to help Maine business."
Mike Demers of the state Department of Economic and Community Development is out to do just that. Jacques credits him and Dennis Proctor of the Maine Food Processors Association for much of the behind-the-scenes work that has helped keep the Maine-made food display going.
Jacques and his wife now buy products from the department, including Shipyard Ale from Kennebunkport, McMillen's champagne mustard from Eliot, and Mother's Mountain mustards from Falmouth.
He expects the section to grow as he becomes aware of more products, saying, "This is nothing compared to what there is."
Here are two recipes using products found in the Augusta store's Maine-made food section:
Shrimp Remoulade
2 eggs 4 tablespoons paprika 1/2 cup Mother's Mountain Portland Beer Mustard 1 1/2 cups oil 1/2 cup vinegar 1 lemon 1/3 cup Mother's Mountain ketchup 3 bay leaves 2 teaspoons horseradish 3 cloves garlic 1/2 cup green onions 1/2 cup celery 1/4 to 1/2 cup parsley 3 pounds shrimp boiled and shelled Lettuce
Put eggs, paprika and mustard into mixing bowl. Slowly beat in oil. When thick add vinegar. Squeeze in lemon juice and drop in lemon pieces. Add remaining ingredients except shrimp and lettuce. Refrigerate six hours and then remove lemon pieces. Place shrimp on bed of lettuce on a large platter and dress with remoulade.
Classic Katahdin Cole Slaw
1 large head cabbage, shredded 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 carrot, grated 1 or more cups World Harbors Mount Katahdin Lite Cole Slaw Dressing
Combine all vegetables and mix with dressing.

Lobsters are really insects

Author: Barry, Dave

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]27 Jan 1996: 1.

Abstract: I have always maintained that they are. I personally see no significant difference between a lobster and, say, a giant Madagascar hissing cockroach, wich is a type of cockroach that grows to approximately the size of William Howard Taft (1857-1930). If a group of diners were sitting in a nice restaurant and the waiter were to bring them each a freshly killed, steaming-hot Madagascar hissing cockroach, they would not put on silly bibs and eat it with butter. No, they would run, retching, directly from the restaurant to the All-Nite Drive-Thru Lawsuit Center. And yet these very same people will pay $24.95 apiece to eat a lobster, despite the fact that it displays all three of the classic lobster biological characteristics of an insect, namely: That is not all. According to articles sent in by alert readers (this was on the FRONT PAGE of The New York Times), scientists in Denmark recently discovered that some lobsters have a weird little pervert organism living ON THEIR LIPS. Yes. I didn't even know that lobsters HAD lips, but it turns out that they do, and these lips are the stomping ground of a tiny creature called "Symbion Pandora" (literally, "a couple of Greek words"). The zoology community, which does not get out a lot, is extremely excited about Symbion Pandora, because it reproduces differently from all other life forms. According to various articles, when Symbion Pandora is ready to have a baby, its digestive system "collapses and is reconstituted into a larva," which the parent then gives birth to by "extruding" it from its "posterior." In other words -- correct me if I am wrong here -- this thing basically reproduces by pooping.

Full text: I am pleased to report that the scientific community has finaly stopped wasting time on the origins of the universe and started dealing with the important question, which is: Are lobsters really just big insects?
I have always maintained that they are. I personally see no significant difference between a lobster and, say, a giant Madagascar hissing cockroach, wich is a type of cockroach that grows to approximately the size of William Howard Taft (1857-1930). If a group of diners were sitting in a nice restaurant and the waiter were to bring them each a freshly killed, steaming-hot Madagascar hissing cockroach, they would not put on silly bibs and eat it with butter. No, they would run, retching, directly from the restaurant to the All-Nite Drive-Thru Lawsuit Center. And yet these very same people will pay $24.95 apiece to eat a lobster, despite the fact that it displays all three of the classic lobster biological characteristics of an insect, namely:
1. It has way more legs than necessary. 2. There is no way you would ever pet it.
3. It does not respond to simple commands such as, "Here, boy!"
I do not eat eat lobsters, although I once had a close call. I was visiting my good friends Tom and Pat Schroth, who live in Maine (state motto: "Cold, But Damp"). Being generous and hospitable people, Tom and Pat went out and purchased, as a special treat for me, the largest lobster in the history of the Atlantic Ocean, a lobster that had probably been responsible for sinking many commercial vessels before it was finally apprehended by nuclear submarines.
This lobster was big enough to feed a coastal Maine village for a year, and there it was, sprawling all over my plate, with scary insectoid legs and eyeballs shooting out in all directions, while Tom and Pat, my gracious hosts, smiled happily at me, waiting for me to put this thing in my mouth.
Remember when you were a child, and your mom wouldn't let you leave the dinner table until you ate all your bussels sprouts, and so you took your fork and mashed them into smaller and smaller pieces in hopes of eventually reducing them to individual brussels-sprout molecules that would be absorbed into the atmosphere and disappear? That was similar to the approach I took with the giant lobster.
"Mmmm-MMMM!" I said, hacking away at the thing on my plate, and when nobody was looking, concealing my pieces under my dinner roll, in the salad, in my napkin, anywhere I could find.
Tom and Pat: I love you dearly, and if you should even have an electrical problem that turns out to be caused by a seven-pound wad of old lobster pieces stuffed into the dining room wall socket, I am truly sorry.
Anyway, my point is that lobsters have long been suspected, by me at least, of being closet insects, which is why I was very pleased recently when my alert journalism colleague Steve Doig referred me to an Associated Press article concerning a discovery by scientists at the University of Wisconsin. The article, headlined GENE LINKS SPIDERS AND FLIES TO LOBSTERS, states that not only do lobsters, flies, spiders, millipedes, etc., contain THE EXACT SAME GENE, but they also are all descended from a single common ancestor: Howard Stern.
No, seriously, the article states that the ancestor "probably was a wormlike creature." Yum! Fetch the melted butter!
And that is not all. According to articles sent in by alert readers (this was on the FRONT PAGE of The New York Times), scientists in Denmark recently discovered that some lobsters have a weird little pervert organism living ON THEIR LIPS. Yes. I didn't even know that lobsters HAD lips, but it turns out that they do, and these lips are the stomping ground of a tiny creature called "Symbion Pandora" (literally, "a couple of Greek words"). The zoology community, which does not get out a lot, is extremely excited about Symbion Pandora, because it reproduces differently from all other life forms. According to various articles, when Symbion Pandora is ready to have a baby, its digestive system "collapses and is reconstituted into a larva," which the parent then gives birth to by "extruding" it from its "posterior." In other words -- correct me if I am wrong here -- this thing basically reproduces by pooping.
So to summarize: If you're looking for a hearty entree that (1) is related to spiders; (2) is descended from a worm; and (3) has mutant baby-poopers walking around on its lips; then you definitely want a lobster. I myself plan to continue avoiding them, just as I avoid oysters, which are clearly -- scientists should look into this next -- members of the phlegm family. Have you ever seen oysters reproduce? Neither have I, but I would not be surprised to learn that the process involves giant undersea nostrils.
And don't get me started on clams. Recently I sat across from a person who was deliberately eating clams; she'd open up a shell, and there, in plain view, would be this stark naked clam, brazenly showing its organs, like a high-school biology experiment. My feeling is that if a restaurant is going to serve those things, it should put little loincloths on them.
I believe that Mother Nature gave us eyes because she did not want us to eat this type of food. Mother Nature clearly intended for us to get our food from the "patty" group, which includes hamburgers, fish sticks and McNuggets -- foods that have had all of their organs safely removed someplace far away, such as Nebraska. That is where I stand on this issue, and if any qualified member of the lobster, clam or phlegm-in-a-shell industry wishes to present a rebuttal, I hereby extend this offer: Get your own column.

Abstract: The Department of Labor last summer announced a $3.2 million grant to retrain Maine and New Hampshire fishermen being forced out of business by declining fish stocks and increasingly stringent state and federal regulations. The program intends to retrain about 400 fishermen during the next two years. More than 80 have expressed interest since counseling and resource centers opened in coastal counties last fall. A survey of fishermen and the evolving shape of the New England economy make the focus upon business start-ups the logical choice, [Scott Tilton] said. "We heard from 160 fishermen, with an average of 20 years in the industry. That's a long time to be independent, setting your own hours, making your own plans. While this type of program usually retrains a person to go from a factory that's closing to a different factory that's still open, it makes no sense here to try to fit people into a mold they don't fit into. Tilton said a sense of personal history also is turning many fishermen into would-be entrepreneurs. "Most of the fishermen we talk to come from a long line of fishermen, going back for generations in the same small town. Many see the handwriting on the wall as far as needing to do something else for a living, but very few are willing to relocate to work in an established business.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Given the natural aversion of Maine fishermen to time clocks, a federal program to retrain those displaced by their industry's decline is shifting the effort away from big-business recruitment and toward small-business creation.
Scott Tilton, director of the U.S. Department of Labor Fishing Industries Retraining Project, said Monday early returns from fishermen interested in changing careers "shows a strong preference for developing their own small-business opportunities rather than going to work for larger employers. They know the risks, they know the work involved and they clearly like being on their own, reponsible for themselves and their families."
The Department of Labor last summer announced a $3.2 million grant to retrain Maine and New Hampshire fishermen being forced out of business by declining fish stocks and increasingly stringent state and federal regulations. The program intends to retrain about 400 fishermen during the next two years. More than 80 have expressed interest since counseling and resource centers opened in coastal counties last fall.
A $250,000 pilot program launched in Cumberland County a year ago has started 27 fishermen on course for new jobs in such diverse fields as building and mechanical trades, computer and medical technology, commercial shipping, clerical work and the ministry.
A survey of fishermen and the evolving shape of the New England economy make the focus upon business start-ups the logical choice, Tilton said. "We heard from 160 fishermen, with an average of 20 years in the industry. That's a long time to be independent, setting your own hours, making your own plans. While this type of program usually retrains a person to go from a factory that's closing to a different factory that's still open, it makes no sense here to try to fit people into a mold they don't fit into.
"Maine has traditionally been a state of small businesses -- almost 90 percent -- and the trend appears to be moving even more strongly in that direction. For this program to be successful, we need a vision of what we want the fishing industry to look like and what we want Maine to look like."
Tilton said a sense of personal history also is turning many fishermen into would-be entrepreneurs. "Most of the fishermen we talk to come from a long line of fishermen, going back for generations in the same small town. Many see the handwriting on the wall as far as needing to do something else for a living, but very few are willing to relocate to work in an established business.
This is an issue of tremendous importance to Maine -- many small, coastal communities won't survive if the declining fishing economy isn't replaced by something else."
Outside of Cumberland County, where the program had a head start, the strongest early response is from Washington County, where 19 fishermen have inquired about retraining.
While some ask about becoming diesel mechanics or electricians, Tilton said, several fishermen way Down East are looking into two truly entrepreneurial enterprises -- shellfish aquaculture and cranberry growing.
"Both of those businesses have great, untapped potential and the region is well-suited for them," Tilton said. "It's farming a crop, rather than hunting the sea, but there are some similarities that make them attractive to fishermen, issues fishermen deal with every day -- nature, the elements, working outdoors, you're concerned with a harvest, your success depends a lot on your own individual effort.
"Two other benefits of shellfish and cranberries are that they aren't as capital-intensive as a lot of other ventures, and a successful operation could provide employment for a good number of people. There's a lot of potential if they're developed properly."
The retraining project is part of a $30 million federal emergency aid program to pare down the New England fishing industry so that a smaller but more healthy fishing fleet remains should fish stocks rebound. Other elements of the program include a revolving loan fund for business development and a boat buyout.
Although fishermen aren't breaking down the doors of the retraining centers, Tilton says a lot are giving serious thought to their futures, especially with new federal regulations in the works to cut the fishing effort further.
"A lot of fishermen I talk to are doing OK financially right now, but they know they're going to have to cross over sooner or later," Tilton said. "As the new regulations start to take shape this spring, I think we'll see more and more getting off the fence. It's an extremely tough decision, but it's not a decision that can be put off much longer."

Abstract: Sovereign rights, clam conservation and the right of a municipality to establish ordinances to regulate clam harvesting were the topics of a meeting Saturday between representatives of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and officials from Eastport and Perry. Eastport and Perry have enacted shellfish conservation ordinances to regulate clam harvesting in their areas. The Eastport ordinance is important because of the plan to open Half Moon Cove, nearly 300 acres of clam flats in Eastport between Carlow Island, Snyder Road and Toll Bridge Road. "The Maine state DMR is ready to open Half Moon Cove to digging. What they are waiting for is the Eastport City Council and Eastport Shellfish Committee to decide how to deal with that opening," Hopkins explained. He said a survey is needed to ascertain the number of clams the area may have.

Full text: PLEASANT POINT -- Sovereign rights, clam conservation and the right of a municipality to establish ordinances to regulate clam harvesting were the topics of a meeting Saturday between representatives of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and officials from Eastport and Perry.
Although everyone at the meeting clearly was in favor of protecting the clam beds from overharvesting, there was no agreement on how to regulate harvesting.
Historically, tribal members have viewed Cobscook Bay as an entity open to anyone who cared to use it. In contrast, some neighboring municipalities believe that controlled access to only a limited number of licensed commercial clammers offers greater protection to that resource.
At the meeting Saturday, Will Hopkins, project coordinator for the Cobscook Bay Clam Restoration Project, talked about the condition of Cobscook Bay, efforts to increase productivity of the clam flats and the effort to develop a regional approach to clam management.
Eastport and Perry have enacted shellfish conservation ordinances to regulate clam harvesting in their areas. The Eastport ordinance is important because of the plan to open Half Moon Cove, nearly 300 acres of clam flats in Eastport between Carlow Island, Snyder Road and Toll Bridge Road.
The Eastport Marine Resource Committee recommends that if the Maine Department of Marine Resources opens that area for the harvesting of shellfish, the one-third of the cove that connects with Carlow Island should be open to clamming, but the remaining two-thirds should remain closed for conservation purposes. The flat has been closed since 1973 because of fecal-coliform pollution.
Some believe if the area is not regulated, it will be overharvested within weeks.
"The Maine state DMR is ready to open Half Moon Cove to digging. What they are waiting for is the Eastport City Council and Eastport Shellfish Committee to decide how to deal with that opening," Hopkins explained. He said a survey is needed to ascertain the number of clams the area may have.
The Eastport ordinance calls for licenses to be issued to 15 residents and two nonresidents.
Tribal legislative Rep. Fred Moore said that Passamaquoddys believe they have a sovereign right to marine resources in the bay.
"We as native people do subscribe to certain conservation methods ... but I need to address the issue of licenses. ... The Passamaquoddy people have not ever felt that they must obtain licenses in order to engage in the harvesting of any marine resources. That is not a new position. That comes from centuries and centuries of occupying this area," he explained.
Historically, Moore said, tribal members did not believe anyone owned the sea and that its resources were available to anyone. He said the tribe would have to go through an educational process.
"We must understand what has happened to the clams and other resources. We have to educate our people, and you must bear with us while we catch up on this issue. We must bring home the importance of the idea of conservation," the tribal representative said.
Eastport City Council Chairman Charlie Lewis told Moore that there was no effort to lock anyone out of the harvesting, but the city was looking at ways to protect the valuable resource.
Moore said there were fewer Passamaquoddy clam diggers than in years past. He estimated there were about 12 commercial diggers during the winter months and a few more in the summer.
Although the tribe has an ordinance that requires tribal members to be licensed for marine resource harvesting, there is no ordinance that specifically deals with shellfish harvesting. Moore said the tribe would not enter into any agreement with a neighboring community that would relinquish the tribe's sovereign rights.
"I can tell you if we did enter into any agreement, it would be subject to renewal on an annual basis. The tribe will not lock itself, or future generations, into something they could not pursue in the future," Moore explained.

County commissioner count revisited

Abstract: "We may sit on it until after the referendum," said the delegation's chairwoman, Rep. Theone Look, R-Jonesboro. She will propose emergency legislation to amend the existing commissioner vacancy law so the governor can appoint an interim commissioner until [Mary Follis]' term expires or she returns to the commission. A public straw poll last week at a meeting attended by 30 people unanimously opposed a five-member commission. Denying that his board has ignored the county's need for economic development, [Norman Nelson Sr.] said Tuesday that he and [Edward Cline] budgeted about $90,000 to sustain economic-oriented public service organizations this year. County grants for 1996 included $40,000 for the University of Maine Extension; $15,350 for program grants, including $4,200 for the Sunrise Economic Council and $2,500 for Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery; $11,340 for the Soil & Water Conservation District; $7,500 for Eastern Maine Development District; $6,160 for Regional Planning Commission; $4,800 for airports; and $3,000 for Resource Conservation and Development. [Harry Bailey], Sen. Vinton Cassidy, R-Calais, and Rep. Joseph Driscoll, D-Calais -- all members of the Legislature's Transportation Committee -- got "a major portion of the Department of Transportation's construction funds last year," Bailey said, to build a new $13 million cargo port at Estes Head in Eastport.

Full text: MACHIAS -- Most members of the Washington County legislative delegation say a larger board of county commissioners ought to enable the board to shoulder more responsibility for improving the county's economic future by building on its wood, aquaculture, blueberry and cranberry industries, and by squeezing development opportunities out of the Port of Eastport.
Rep. Harry Bailey, R-Grand Lake Stream, criticized the current commissioners this week for not doing more to promote economic development and for rejecting the delegation's successful legislation that gave the commission two additional seats.
"The commissioners in this county have been derelict of their duties. We need an aggressive board that will work with the governor and business to improve the economy of this county. I still feel the county needs five commissioners. I feel that this county is dying on the vine because of a lack of leaders who should be looking to develop the county," he said.
Commissioners Norman Nelson Sr. and Edward Cline, who have worked as a two-member board since last June, when Chairwoman Mary Follis was incapacitated by a freak highway accident, countered Bailey's criticism Tuesday, saying the governor's appointment of two additional commissioners would unnecessarily increase the county tax assessment by about $38,000.
The delegation and the commission are in agreement that a countywide referendum should be held in March or November for voters to resolve the commissioner count issue.
The delegation will meet this morning in Augusta to consider allowing the five-commissioner law to go unrepealed until after the referendum.
"We may sit on it until after the referendum," said the delegation's chairwoman, Rep. Theone Look, R-Jonesboro. She will propose emergency legislation to amend the existing commissioner vacancy law so the governor can appoint an interim commissioner until Follis' term expires or she returns to the commission. A public straw poll last week at a meeting attended by 30 people unanimously opposed a five-member commission.
Nelson predicts voters would discard the five-commissioner concept because "at our public meeting last Friday night, a good cross section of 30 county people were unanimously against having five commissioners. They only wanted the existing law amended to allow the governor to appoint an interim commissioner as a stand-in for Mary Follis."
Reps. James Layton, R-Cherryfield, and George Bunker, D-Topsfield, in interviews Tuesday, disagreed with Nelson's assessment of the straw poll. "It is absolutely foolishness for anyone to say that was a good cross section of county residents," Layton said. Only two people from his district, both from Addison, attended the public hearing, he said.
Denying that his board has ignored the county's need for economic development, Nelson said Tuesday that he and Cline budgeted about $90,000 to sustain economic-oriented public service organizations this year. County grants for 1996 included $40,000 for the University of Maine Extension; $15,350 for program grants, including $4,200 for the Sunrise Economic Council and $2,500 for Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery; $11,340 for the Soil & Water Conservation District; $7,500 for Eastern Maine Development District; $6,160 for Regional Planning Commission; $4,800 for airports; and $3,000 for Resource Conservation and Development.
"I know we have a severe unemployment problem, but I hope our legislators don't try to correct it with five commissioners," said Cline. "We've done what we could do, but those in Augusta have been no help. We had an opportunity to have 700 to 800 jobs by approving a casino for Calais, but they turned it down, saying it would corrupt us morally. It was they who didn't do their best work for this county."
Bailey, in his argument for a greater countywide vision of economic development, said, "A five-commissioner board would give this county a more broad range of vision of economic development at the grass-roots level." Several people interested in gaining the governor's appointment to a five-member board have mentioned in their resumes that they have a strong interest in building up the county's overall economy, he added.
A significant part of the commission's work, Bailey said, should be committed to attracting state and federal grants that can be used appropriately on economic development projects that result in generating jobs. "I think if we rely just on Dianne Tilton {executive director of Sunrise Economic Council} and the legislative delegation to get the job done, it isn't going to get done."
The county should develop "an economic development plan that unites, consolidates, and involves appropriate research people from the University of Maine, bankers, business leaders and administrators from our towns and cities. We've got knowledgeable people all around this county," he said. "We need to get them in a room together and plan some direction. We could get any amount of money necessary to create jobs. You can't overdo economic development."
Bailey, Sen. Vinton Cassidy, R-Calais, and Rep. Joseph Driscoll, D-Calais -- all members of the Legislature's Transportation Committee -- got "a major portion of the Department of Transportation's construction funds last year," Bailey said, to build a new $13 million cargo port at Estes Head in Eastport.
Eastport has already become New England's fastest-growing international cargo port and a critical part of the state's transportation network by shipping products to global markets. The Estes Head facility will be improved to accommodate 900-foot container ships. "But we won't be drawing on the container port's greatest potential if we don't make railroad container cars available," Bailey said.
"In the next 10 years, this county should re-establish train service between Machias and Bangor," he said. "For $20 million we could get the track. That would be a pretty good investment, considering $20 million only builds 15 miles of road."
"What Harry is saying makes a lot of sense," said Layton. You can't leave all that load on Dianne Tilton. A five-member board of commissioners would lessen the excuse that they are overburdened."
"The commissioners should lead the charge and we could pick it up and take it to the governor and the Legislature," said Bunker.

Full text: JONESPORT -- Fires on Thursday and Friday destroyed part of a shellfish plant in Beals, and gutted the first floor of a home at the head of Dan Watt Beach in Jonesport.
At 2 a.m. Thursday, fire destroyed an ice-making machine, a seafood products cooler, and a 30-by-30-foot section of roof at the Carver Shellfish Co. plant on the Black Duck Cove Road on Great Wass Island.
Fire Chief Randy Kelley said one of Carver's truck drivers, returning to the plant after a delivery, spotted the fire and alerted firefighters.
The Addison Fire Department was called as a backup on the Carver fire because Jonesport Fire Department's hose lines began to freeze in temperatures that hovered around zero.
An electrical wiring problem may have caused the fire, Kelley said.
At 1 p.m. Friday, fire gutted the kitchen and other rooms on the first floor of Eddie Hagan's house on Bridge Street in Jonesport.
Fast response by firefighters from the U.S. Coast Guard Station, located a few feet from the Hagan house, prevented more serious damage to the two-story dwelling. The fire may have been caused by an electrical wiring problem, the chief said.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Rockland and Warren veterans are planning war memorials.
In Rockland, the Rockland Area Veteran's Memorial Committee will sponsor an "After the Holidays" bottle drive to raise money. The organization is planning to erect a monument at the Mechanic Street Snow Memorial Park.
Those interested in donating bottles should call 594-5026 or 594-2982 for pickup on Saturday, Jan. 6. Volunteers will be picking up bottles from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Donations can also be dropped off at the American Legion Post on Maverick Street.
Volunteers are involved from the Rotary, Kiwanis, Elks, Rockland Share the Pride, Rockland-Thomaston area Chamber of Commerce, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars and Marine Corps League.
In Warren, a war memorial committee has been at work gathering names of Warren natives who have served in the armed services during five wars. In a project expected to cost $11,000, bronze plaques attached to a stone monument will carry the names of the residents.
The monument will honor those who served in the Persian Gulf War, Vietnam, Korea, World War II and World War I. The names of the veterans are on a list at Town Hall, the post office and the Oyster River Grange for review.
Donations to the fund drive can be made any time. Those with questions should contact committee members William Chapman, Ed Boggs, Joe Cifaldo, Casey Smith or Art Jura.

Abstract: Maine "snowbirds" heading to Florida for the winter months may find an unpleasant surprise in store for them. The red fire ant, introduced to North America from Brazil by ships docking in Mobile in the 1930s, has now become widespread throughout the entire Southeast. Packing a vicious bite, it has been observed killing young birds, reptiles, rodents, and fawns, the fire ant has no natural enemies in its adopted land. It has proven a deadly foe to native species in its path killing off up to 40 percent of all native insects in areas that it has invaded. The red ant has even proven fatal to some humans allergic to its venom while making life unpleasant for countless others who have suffered by its bite. According to Chris Bright, associate editor of World Watch, the red fire ant is only one example of what can happen when human activity introduces exotic species into new habitat.

Full text: Maine "snowbirds" heading to Florida for the winter months may find an unpleasant surprise in store for them. The red fire ant, introduced to North America from Brazil by ships docking in Mobile in the 1930s, has now become widespread throughout the entire Southeast. Packing a vicious bite, it has been observed killing young birds, reptiles, rodents, and fawns, the fire ant has no natural enemies in its adopted land. It has proven a deadly foe to native species in its path killing off up to 40 percent of all native insects in areas that it has invaded. The red ant has even proven fatal to some humans allergic to its venom while making life unpleasant for countless others who have suffered by its bite. According to Chris Bright, associate editor of World Watch, the red fire ant is only one example of what can happen when human activity introduces exotic species into new habitat.
Also in the 1930s, someone conceived of the idea of drying up the Everglades by covering it with seeds of the Melaleuca tree, a native of Australia noted for taking up large quantities of water. The result is a dense, impenetrable stand of trees that have displaced nearly every other type of vegetation. The Melaleuca has taken over 1.5 million acres of Florida wetlands and, says U.S. Agriculture Department expert Ronald Myers, "Soon the Everglades will be no more." Most exotic species have found their way into the United States by accident but a few have been introduced deliberately. The starling, native to England, has conquered the United States thanks to a theatrical society determined on introducing every bird mentioned in the plays of Shakespeare into North America. In the 1960s the state of Montana introduced the opposum shrimp into the Flathead River in hopes of providing food for another import, a species of salmon introduced as a game fish. Instead, the shrimp nearly destroyed the local zooplankton, the main food supply for salmon, and the fish population collapsed. Along with it went many species, as eagles, coyotes, and bears that depended on the salmon for food.
Exotic imports frequently cause economic, as well as environmental, damage according to Bright. The 1981 outbreak of gypsy moth caused losses to U.S. forests estimated at $764 million. The zebra mussel, a recently arrived shellfish from the Caspian, has already started to clog waterways throughout the east since entering the Great Lakes fromballast water pumped out of cargo ships. The mussel attaches to any available surface including powerplant water pipes forcing the industry to spend $60 million annually on maintenance and $800 million to redesign its cooling systems.
Although ecologists have numerous examples of the after-effects of placing exotic species in a new habitat, there is little in these "after the fact" cases that will allow a prediction of what damage a new introduction will cause.
Bright says the accumulated evidence can be summed up in three statement, all negative. It is impossible to say where an exotic imported species will establish itself, what damage it will do, or when it will do it. A species of dove introduced into southern Europe from Turkey maintained a low, constant population for more than two centuries until it exploded across the continent beginning in 1930. Why? No one really knows. In the American Midwest, says Bright, an ornamental garden shrub escaped into the wild displacing a number of native species. Again there is no good explanation except the suggestion that species spread out after having adapted to local climates and human activities. The Asian tiger mosquito arrived in the United States in the mid-1980s in water trapped in junk auto tires. Since then it has fine-tuned its daylight sensitivity.
Bright warns that the expanding global economy is giving rise to an equally expanding biological pollution in terms of exotic species into new habitats. Almost no scientific predictive evidence exists for such invasions and they should be guarded against as stringently as keeping infectious diseases from our shores.

Girl Scouts keep helpful holiday tradition

Abstract: For three years, the young Girl Scouts under the leadership of Penny Holmes and Nancy Hanlon of Brewer have helped out the less fortunate in their community. Now third-grade Brownies, the eight youngsters from Pendleton Street School are continuing the tradition they began as Daisy Scouts. They particularly enjoy their Christmas experiences, Holmes said. "They really have a great time buying gifts and getting them wrapped." Also last month, the troop purchased pet toys and cat box filler, delivering 200 pounds to the Bangor Humane Society. Two years ago, after a brother of a troop member made a visit to the Eastern Maine Medical Center emergency room, and the girls learned that no toys were available for waiting patients, the troop donated toys to the ER.

Full text: For three years, the young Girl Scouts under the leadership of Penny Holmes and Nancy Hanlon of Brewer have helped out the less fortunate in their community.
Now third-grade Brownies, the eight youngsters from Pendleton Street School are continuing the tradition they began as Daisy Scouts. They particularly enjoy their Christmas experiences, Holmes said. "They really have a great time buying gifts and getting them wrapped."
Last year, Troop 589 participated in a yearlong project starting in October. "We helped out one particular family," Holmes said. "We didn't know who the people were. It was all done through the school. But each month the girls would do something different for that family."
Money to purchase food and gifts comes from the Scouts' magazine and cookie sales. This year, the girls put together a complete Thanksgiving dinner for a needy Brewer family.
"People just park when they see us coming," Holmes said about taking the entire troop shopping. "Actually, they head for the hills. The girls do all the grocery shopping and they have a wonderful time. People enjoy watching them."
Also last month, the troop purchased pet toys and cat box filler, delivering 200 pounds to the Bangor Humane Society. Two years ago, after a brother of a troop member made a visit to the Eastern Maine Medical Center emergency room, and the girls learned that no toys were available for waiting patients, the troop donated toys to the ER.
On Tuesday, Troop 589 held its annual Christmas party, which was another opportunity to help a neighbor in need.
This year, its Christmas gift request came from MERT, a local independent agency that helps support mentally handicapped adults. One client wanted a doll, the troop was told.
"The girls purchased the doll, and then each of them, instead of exchanging gifts among themselves, bought a gift for the doll," Holmes said.
In between the pizza and the cookies, they wrapped the gifts that will certainly make someone very happy this Christmas.
An event that helps kick off the holiday season in the Greater Ellsworth area -- the fourh annual Poinsettia Ball, which took place the first Saturday in December at the White Birches Restaurant in Hancock -- raised $14,000 for the Maine Coast Memeorial Hospital emergency room, MCMH development director Don Baril reported this week to the hospital's board of directors.
Katherine Heidinger and Bette Pierson served as chairwomen of a 13-member committee that spent four months organizing the fund-raiser. More than 280 people paid $50 per person for an evening of dining and dancing in a Christmas setting. The event was sponsored by R.H. Foster Inc. and Machias Savings Bank. Atlantic Salmon of Maine donated fresh salmon and Maine Shellfish fresh shrimp for the popular fund-raiser.
The $14,000 will be used to purchase an additional defibrillator for the ER and to revamp the ER reception area to provide more privacy for patients and family members. MCMH served more than 20,000 people last year through the hospital, the Eleanor Widener Dixon Memorial Clinic in Gouldsboro, and the Southwest Harbor Medical Center.
Even during the holiday season, the Kids Campaign to help save Fort Knox is not forgotten.
Friends of Fort Knox spokesman George MacLeod informs us that children at the Bucksport Middle School had volunteered to stuff envelopes Wednesday and Thursday for an emergency mailing for the restoration fund, but the snowstorm closed local schools, and it looked like the project would be left undone since vacation officially begins today.
But you can't keep good kids down, especially when they care about Maine's most visited historic site. This morning, several students are volunteering their time, at school, to stuff those envelopes.
Don't forget the Hampden Fire Department after-holiday bottle and can drive Jan. 1-15.
Drop off cans and bottles at the Fire Department, or call 862-4586 to have them picked up by a department member. The money raised goes toward the purchase of a hydraulic rescue tool.
Through mid-December, nearly one-third of the $15,000 goal has been raised. Raffle tickets are selling well, reports Lt. Frank Coombs, and may be purchased at the department or from any HFD member. In the first eight days of the canister drive, more than $160 in loose change had been contributed to the fund-raiser.
"The community has been very suportive and we want to thank them for this support," said Coombs.

Clam diggers far from clear about future Industry members split on need for tightening or loosening limits

Full text: ROCKPORT -- With big losses in digging jobs and sales during the past decade, the state's clam industry is struggling to restore depleted clam beds, while developing sophisticated controls to protect what is left of the resource.
At a session on municipal clam management held at the Samoset Resort Inn on Friday, it was obvious that the several hundred industry representatives were split on a future course. Some wanted no regulation. Others wanted more regulation, even a tax on landings to raise money for research on reseeding and the effects of pollution by municipal waste treatment plants, paper mills and the blueberry industry.
Waldoboro clam digger David Sanborn said the state's 1,627 licensed diggers should be allowed to dig "anywhere we want to on the 3,500-mile coastline." Sanborn and other clam diggers are collecting petitions to repeal all municipal clam ordinances, which normally restrict nonresident permits to a handful per year. If enough signatures are collected, the repeal measure will be on the state ballot, he said.
"We want to be able to go anywhere and make a living, like our fathers did," said James Beam of Edgecomb.
Unrestricted digging would lead to "the death of the clam industry," according to James MacLeod of Brunswick, which protects its $2 million a year clam resource with a clam ordinance that is seen as a model for other coastal communities.
If laws were repealed, diggers would clean out "hot spots" like Brunswick, where some healthy flats remain, then move up the coast, MacLeod said. Even with its model clam ordinance, Brunswick was forced to close the flats for the winter "because they were hammered so bad," MacLeod said.
Repealing the municipal ordinances would place the clam industry into the same condition as the groundfish resource, said Joel Knee of West Bath. "If you open it up, you won't have a single clam left in West Bath," he said. He told the conference he was as much a Mainer as anyone in the huge Samoset meeting room, although he was born in Utah.
As usual, the clam management discussion considered the repeal of the 2-inch clam law. With Maine diggers prohibited from taking a clam smaller than 2 inches, a strong restaurant market for smaller "steamer" clams will go to other states, diggers said. Since the 2-inch law was passed in 1984, production has dropped by 67 percent, said Mike Brewer of Damariscotta. He favored repeal of the law.
No clam production area has been harder hit than Washington and Hancock county flats that used to produce 65 percent of the state's clam landings. Now the production is down to 22-23 percent, with an annual decline of $5 million in landings along with hundreds of jobs.
Clammers should welcome regulation and insist on greater water quality control, according to Will Hopkins of Eastport.
"I want to be able to shuck a clam on any flat and eat it. I don't want to worry about it. My father didn't have to worry about it and I don't want my kids to worry about it," Hopkins said. He said Maine should set goals of manufacturing paper without placing any dioxin in the water and making shellfish safe to eat, anywhere in the state.
Along the lengthy coast of Washington and Hancock counties, clam bed surveys in many towns are more difficult to conduct than in relatively compact communities like Brunswick, which has only 400 acres of beds and a population of 20,000.
In Eastport, with a population of 2,000, there are more than 1,300 acres of clam beds and "practically no clams." The Down East community is working with schoolchildren to monitor clam beds as a science project. "It beats the hell out of watching MTV," Hopkins said.
Since Robin Alden was named state Department of Marine Resources commissioner, Augusta has shown a marked improvement in attitude, Hopkins said. "We don't have to spit when we say `state' or `DMR' anymore," he said. Hopkins took the heretical step of suggesting a tax on clam sales to support reseeding and research projects.
The key to a comprehensive, working management system will be public relations and education, said Peter Angis of Scarborough. Towns should welcome recreational diggers, who can become an asset at budget time when funds are sought for seeding or other clam projects. Scarborough, described as the fastest-growing town in Maine, has continuing problems with development and its effect on the clam flats, Angis said. "Every new roof is a new problem," he said.
Community involvement is vital, said MacLeod. Brunswick rotates open flats every 10 days to protect the resource and keep its 86 clam diggers at work. With licenses sold at $100 a year, the town has a $60,000 budget for clam control and restoration.
Although clamming used to be thought of as the "saltwater poor farm, I am not ashamed to be a clam digger. I have dug for 30 years," MacLeod said.
Most speakers agreed that something has to be done in managing the flats. "You're lucky to get a peck of clams anywhere in the state," complained one woman.

Full text: EASTPORT -- The Maine clam industry has lost millions of dollars and thousands of jobs during the past decade, and people here want to know what can be done to make the industry in the Cobscook Bay area viable again.
On Saturday, nearly 40 recreational and commercial clammers and members of the town's clam committees met at the Marine Technology Center to consider ways to improve management and increase productivity in the Cobscook Bay area clam flats.
The group also discussed sending delegates to a statewide meeting in Rockport on Dec. 8.
Closure of clam flats often leads to an outcry from local clammers. During the meeting Saturday, Paul Anderson, director of Shellfish Sanitation for the Department of Marine Resources, drew laughter when he began his presentation with a quick question and answer. "Why do we close clam flats, and who decides? I decide. Any questions?" he asked.
Clammers had plenty of questions about closure of the flats, environmental impact, and possible solutions to problems that close the flats.
Anderson explained that pollution hurts clamming. "We are talking about sewage pollutants, things that we know get into clams and make them harmful. That is why we close them," he explained.
Chemical pollutants such as Velpar, an herbicide used on blueberry lands, are not addressed by Anderson's department, although he admitted those issues need to be examined.
"Somewhere along the way, we need to bring in researchers, perhaps environmental protection agencies and other means of looking at those questions. I don't think we can expect the DMR to answer all those questions for you," he said.
Anderson warned that figures regarding the size of clam flats statewide should be viewed cautiously. He said there are about 98,000 acres of flats.
"Don't take these numbers as gospel because there are different ways of getting these numbers. But it has been said for the last 20 years that about a third of our flats are closed statewide. Of course, depending on where you live, 100 percent of your flats may be closed," he said.
The pollution problems the DMR examines include: municipal treatment plants; licensed overboard discharge; septic system straight pipes; septic system malfunctions; outhouses; waste left behind by domestic animals and wildlife; marinas and anchorages; and streams and other fresh water.
Anderson said water-quality monitoring involves 2,400 stations from Kittery to Canada, which are sampled six times each year. Once the water has been tested, the flat from which it was taken is placed in one of four possible classifications: approved, which means it may remain open; prohibited, which means it must close; restricted, which means there may be a pollution problem but it is not affecting the immediate area; and conditionally approved.
Anderson explained that flats receive conditional approval because of differing seasonal conditions.
"We might find out that it is dirty in the summer, but clean in the winter. Then we look around and see there is a marina and boats and a lot of summer activity. So then we will close it when the data is bad and have it open on the off-season," he said.
In order to reopen a flat, Anderson said, there has to be a change.
"I need to see that the water quality has improved. Or someone calls up and says `We got rid of those three failing septic systems, or the overboard discharge has moved, or we put in a sewage treatment plant and the outfall is over there where there aren't any clams,"' he said.
Anderson said the Department of Environmental Protection has two programs in place to monitor and replace licensed overboard discharge or failed septic systems polluting clam flats. He encouraged small communities in the area to take advantage of those programs.

Abstract: Described as a born-again Christian and a clamdigger, a former Thomaston resident was sentenced to six years in prison Thursday for the 1993 thefts of rugs and other valuables from homes in Hancock, Washington and Lincoln counties. Jeffrey A. Herrick, 32, was found guilty in Hancock County Superior Court earlier this month on three counts of Class B theft and five counts of Class C theft. A jury found him not guilty of several related burglary charges. In appealing for a stiff sentence, Hancock County District Attorney Michael Povich described the crimes as the "systematic" theft of property from elderly people and owners of summer homes. "This is Mr. Herrick's profession," he said.

Full text: ELLSWORTH -- Described as a born-again Christian and a clamdigger, a former Thomaston resident was sentenced to six years in prison Thursday for the 1993 thefts of rugs and other valuables from homes in Hancock, Washington and Lincoln counties.
Jeffrey A. Herrick, 32, was found guilty in Hancock County Superior Court earlier this month on three counts of Class B theft and five counts of Class C theft. A jury found him not guilty of several related burglary charges.
In appealing for a stiff sentence, Hancock County District Attorney Michael Povich described the crimes as the "systematic" theft of property from elderly people and owners of summer homes. "This is Mr. Herrick's profession," he said.
Called in by Povich to recount Herrick's criminal history, Lincoln County District Attorney Geoffrey Rushlau cited several shellfish harvesting and driving violations, as well as what he described as a relatively minor animal cruelty charge.
Defense attorney Jeffrey Toothaker portrayed his client as a hard worker who had done well in recent times supporting his family with "woods work" in Wisconsin.
In addressing the shellfishing offenses, Toothaker suggested that Superior Court Justice Paul T. Pierson, the judge hearing the case, might be unfamiliar with clamming practices because of his Aroostook County background.
Clamming in closed areas is an "occupational hazard," virtually inevitable as more harvesting areas are closed each year, said Toothaker.
Speaking on his own behalf before the sentencing, Herrick described himself as a good person "with rough edges." He said he never stole any rugs, but did go once with an antique dealer to meet with owners of the kinds of rugs he knew the dealer wanted to buy. He said he never told police his side of the story because they didn't ask for it.
In imposing his sentence, Judge Pierson noted Herrick's "remarkable" and extensive criminal record, which includes two years in a Wisconsin prison on a manslaughter charge stemming from a car crash resulting in his boss's death.
Pierson said the series of thefts suggested that Herrick is a professional thief with little regard for the law. He said he would not require restitution for property owners' losses, because it was unlikely it would ever be collected from Herrick.

Abstract: Maine lobsters often travel cross-country, thanks to Cap Morrill's Inc., the well-known Brewer business located at 7 Baker Blvd. in the East-West Industrial Park. Henry Morrill established Cap Morrill's in South Brewer in 1904. He ran a restaurant, a store, and a fish market there for many years, with his four sons (Henry, Carleton, Richard, and James) taking over by mid-century. Today, Phil Morrill, Carleton's son, and his mother and aunt, Stella and Cecile Morrill, own the company. In April 1992, the Morrills purchased a vacant building in the East-West Industrial Park, remodeled it, and moved their business there that November. "I had looked at buildings since 1985, and this was the first building that popped up for sale that met our needs," Morrill said.

Henry Morrill established Cap Morrill's in South Brewer in 1904. He ran a restaurant, a store, and a fish market there for many years, with his four sons (Henry, Carleton, Richard, and James) taking over by mid-century. Today, Phil Morrill, Carleton's son, and his mother and aunt, Stella and Cecile Morrill, own the company.
"We distribute seafood locally and nationwide," Phil Morrill said. "We sold the restaurant some time ago, but we still have the fish market, which is in the same spot on South Main Street." The company employs 18 people.
In April 1992, the Morrills purchased a vacant building in the East-West Industrial Park, remodeled it, and moved their business there that November. "I had looked at buildings since 1985, and this was the first building that popped up for sale that met our needs," Morrill said.
The Morrills built a loading dock and added refrigeration equipment and lobster-holding tanks: fiberglass tanks that can hold 7,000-8,000 pounds and a large concrete tank that can store 144 pallets (about 14,000 pounds). If necessary, "with our overnight capacity, we can store 23,000 pounds (of lobster) here," Morrill said. The tanks are filled with fresh salt water trucked from the coast.
Cap Morrill's distributes seafood in the greater Bangor area with its own trucks. Carl Smith Foods distributes the company's products to Maine customers.
Distant markets are serviced by Federal Express or major airlines. "We are shipping everything from two or three lobsters to an individual, which would go by FedEx," Morrill said, "to a can (a container that holds 2,400 pounds) to go by air (from Bangor or Boston) to another distributor out of state."
Cap Morrill's ships lobsters and scallops to markets in California, Texas, and the Midwest. The company does a strong business in Florida, Morrill said. The Maine tourist season brings strong sales, as do such holidays as Mother's Day and Christmas.
"Lobsters are probably 80 percent of our business. Fish would be the other 20," Morrill said. "We're distributing scallops, haddock, Atlantic salmon, plus swordfish, tuna, halibut, clams, oysters, and periwinkles."

Brunswick's shellfish warden to retire After 20 years of challenging work on the flats, Alan Houston to hang up his boots

Abstract: Alan Houston has come a long way from the days when clam diggers he regulates slashed his tires and threw mud at him. Now, as he prepares to retire after 20 years as Brunswick's marine warden and one of the state's most experienced wardens, Houston enjoys the respect of state legislators, scientists and environmental advocates. "I don't think clammers can be impressed by wardens. They're just someone there to play cat-and-mouse with," chuckled clammer James MacLeod. But the diggers "have more respect for Alan. Therefore they have to work harder to get around him."

Full text:   BRUNSWICK -- Alan Houston has come a long way from the days when clam diggers he regulates slashed his tires and threw mud at him.
Now, as he prepares to retire after 20 years as Brunswick's marine warden and one of the state's most experienced wardens, Houston enjoys the respect of state legislators, scientists and environmental advocates.
Even some of the diggers will allow that Houston is OK.
"I don't think clammers can be impressed by wardens. They're just someone there to play cat-and-mouse with," chuckled clammer James MacLeod. But the diggers "have more respect for Alan. Therefore they have to work harder to get around him."
"We hope there'll be more people like him in time, with good training both in enforcement and management," said Dana Wallace, a shellfish management consultant who worked for 38 years in what is now the state Department of Marine Resources.
Houston, who is retiring from his $31,460-a-year job to spend more time with his family, is departing at a time when the economic value of Maine's shellfish resource is increasingly being recognized.
This month, the Casco Bay Estuary Project estimated that the economy could gain $3.7 million a year if the closed clam beds in Casco Bay were made fit to open.
The Gulf of Maine Council has proposed making restoration of shellfish habitat one of its priorities for the next five years.
Representatives from coastal towns will gather Dec. 8 in Rockport for a conference organized by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension to plan a strategy for increasing clam production statewide.
"People are looking up, trying to come to grips" with the problem, Houston said.
Houston became Brunswick's first full-time marine warden in 1976 at a robust time in the state's clamming industry. In 1973, a peak year, the industry employed nearly 6,000 people who dug 7 million pounds of steamers.
Later, flats began closing because of the threat or existence of bacterial pollution, generally from sewage discharges, throwing the industry into a slump by 1983.
In 1994, the clamming work force had shriveled to about 1,650 people, whose collective harvest was 2 million pounds. Though comparatively meager, the harvest fetched $8.8 million -- enough money to make soft-shell clams Maine's fourth most valuable commercial marine species.
As the clamming industry declined, its centers shifted from Washington County to Cumberland County, and towns like Brunswick, Freeport, Harpswell and Scarborough began devoting more attention to their flats.
When Houston was hired in Brunswick, the town's only requirement for clammers was that they have a license. Since then, the requirements have expanded, and so have Houston's responsibilities.
Nowadays, in addition to checking licenses, he samples water for laboratory testing; inspects shoreline properties for sources of pollution; posts mud flats that must be closed because of pollution or depleted stocks; lectures school children; and even lobbies the Legi- slature for new laws.
"When Alan's there, why, you know there's somebody there who knows what it's all about," said Rep. Theone Look, R-Jonesboro, a 10-year veteran of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee.

Abstract: A general store in Lamoine should open this winter, selectmen said Wednesday. To be situated at the intersection of Routes 184 and 204, the store will be the only one of its kind in Lamoine, a community that has no stores and few commercial enterprises. Lamoine voters overturned the community's traditional dry status last year, repealing a prohibition on the sale of beer and wine. The question on the repeal was brought to voters through a petition drive spearheaded by [Ruth] Keene and fellow entreprenuer David Schroeder. They said their plan for the store was contingent on being able to sell beer and wine.

Full text: LAMOINE -- A general store in Lamoine should open this winter, selectmen said Wednesday.
To be situated at the intersection of Routes 184 and 204, the store will be the only one of its kind in Lamoine, a community that has no stores and few commercial enterprises.
Both the Planning Board and the state Department of Transportation have approved the plans submitted by Ruth Keene for the construction of the 30- by 40-foot convenience store. With work already under way at the site, construction is expected to be finished by the end of January.
Lamoine voters overturned the community's traditional dry status last year, repealing a prohibition on the sale of beer and wine. The question on the repeal was brought to voters through a petition drive spearheaded by Keene and fellow entreprenuer David Schroeder. They said their plan for the store was contingent on being able to sell beer and wine.
The DOT has imposed several conditions on the project because of its location at what some have described as a hazardous intersection.
Included in the conditions are requirements calling for a 57-foot-wide entrance with a raised traffic island, a minimum sight distance in each direction of 450 feet, paved 6-foot-wide shoulders for 100 feet on each side of the entrance, and no parking for a specified distance on each side of the entrance inter- section.
Further, the town has requested that the speed limit in the area of the store be lowered to 35 mph, an action that must be approved at the state level since Route 184 is a state road.
Many in town have welcomed the addition of a general store, not only for the convenience, but also because of the taxes a commercial property can bring to the town. With about 1,300 residents, Lamoine has only a handful of at-home businesses and contractors with small yards.
The other significant commercial enterprises in Lamoine are more than a dozen active gravel pits, small shellfish-packing businesses and a lobster pound.
Others have said Lamoine is unusual because it has no stores or significant business growth.

Abstract: Harriet Beecher Stowe moved to Maine in 1850, with her husband, Calvin Ellis Stowe, a professor at Bowdoin College. In Brunswick, she wrote her famous "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and many stories about New England life, including "The Pearl of Orr's Island" (1862) and "Oldtown Folks" (1869). The latter offers a vivid description of Thanksgiving soon after the Revolutionary War, and is a particularly fitting reminiscence for today. People have often supposed, because the Puritans founded a society where there were no professed public amusements, that therefore there was no fun going on in the ancient land of Israel, and that there were no cakes and ale, because they were virtuous. They were never more mistaken in their lives. There was an abundance of sober, well-considered merriment; and the hinges of life were well oiled with that sort of secret humor which to this day gives the raciness to real Yankee wit. Besides this we must remember that life itself is the greatest possible amusement to people who really believe that they can do so much with it, -- who have that intense sense of what can be brought to pass by human effort, that was characteristic of the New England colonies. To such it is not exactly proper to say that life is an amusement, but it certainly is an engrossing interest that takes the place of all amusements. ...

The latter offers a vivid description of Thanksgiving soon after the Revolutionary War, and is a particularly fitting reminiscence for today.
Are there any of my readers who do not know what Thanksgiving day is to a child? Then let them go back with me, and recall the image of it as we kept it in Oldtown.
People have often supposed, because the Puritans founded a society where there were no professed public amusements, that therefore there was no fun going on in the ancient land of Israel, and that there were no cakes and ale, because they were virtuous. They were never more mistaken in their lives. There was an abundance of sober, well-considered merriment; and the hinges of life were well oiled with that sort of secret humor which to this day gives the raciness to real Yankee wit. Besides this we must remember that life itself is the greatest possible amusement to people who really believe that they can do so much with it, -- who have that intense sense of what can be brought to pass by human effort, that was characteristic of the New England colonies. To such it is not exactly proper to say that life is an amusement, but it certainly is an engrossing interest that takes the place of all amusements. ...
When the apples were all gathered and the cider was all made, and the yellow pumpkins were rolled in from many a hill in billows of gold, and the corn was husked, and the labors of the season were done, and the warm, late days of Indian Summer came in, dreamy and calm and still, with just frost enough to crisp the ground of a morning, but with warm trances of benignant, sunny hours at noon, there came over the community a sort of genial repose of spirit, -- a sense of something accomplished, and of a new golden mark made in advance of the calendar of life, -- and the deacon began to say to the minister, of a Sunday, "I suppose it's time for the Thanksgiving proclamation." ...
We also felt its approach in all departments of the household, -- the conversation at this time beginning to turn on high and solemn culinary mysteries and receipts of wondrous power and virtue. New modes of elaborating squash pies and quince tarts were now ofttimes carefully discussed at the evening fireside by Aunt Lois and Aunt Keziah, and notes seriously compared with the experiences of other Aunties of high repute in such matters. I noticed that on these occasions their voices often fell into mysterious whispers, and that receipts of especial power and sanctity were communicated in tones so low as entirely to escape the vulgar ear. I still remember the solemn shake of the head with which my Aunt Lois conveyed to Miss Mehitable Rossiter the critical properties of mace, in relation to its powers of producing in corn fritters a suggestive resemblance to oysters. As ours was an oyster-getting district, and as that charming bivalve was perfectly easy to come at, the interest of such an imitation can be accounted for only by the fondness of the human mind to works of art.
For as much as a week beforehand, "we children" were employed in chopping mince for pies to a most wearisome fineness, and in pounding cinnamon, allspice, and cloves in a great lignumvitae mortar; and the sound of this pounding and chopping re-echoed through all the rafters of the old house with a hearty and vigorous cheer, most refreshing to our spirits. ...
At other times of the year we sometimes mummured at these labors, but those that were supposed to usher in the great Thanksgiving festival were always entered into with enthusiasm. There were signs of richness all around us, -- stoning of raisins, cutting of citron, slicing of candied orange peel. Yet all these were only dawning and imitations of what was coming during the week of real preparation, after the Governor's proclamation had been read. ...
The cheering anticipation sustained us through what seemed to us the long waste of the sermon and prayers; and when at last the auspicious moment approached, -- when the last quaver of the last hymn had died out, -- the whole house rippled with the general movement of complacency, and a satisfied smile of pleased expectation might be seen gleaming on all the faces of the young people, like a ray of sunshine through a garden of flowers.
Thanksgiving now was dawning! We children poked one another, and fairly giggled with unreproved delight as we listened to the crackle of the slowly unfolding document. That great sheet of paper impressed us as something supernatural, by reason of its mighty size, and by the broad seal of the State affixed thereto; and when the minister read therefrom, "By his Excellency, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a Proclamation," our mirth was with difficulty repressed by admonitory glances from our sympathetic elders. Then, after a solemn enumeration of the benefits which the Commonwealth had that year received at the hands of Divine Providence, came at last the naming of the eventful day, and, at the end of all, the imposing heraldic words, "God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts." And then, as the congregation broke up a dispersed, all went their separate ways with schemes of mirth and feasting in their heads.

Deluge keeps town crews busy Rivers watched for minor flooding; state bans clam, mussel harvesting

Full text:   Another late-fall storm dumped rain across Maine Wednesday, flooding more cellars and culverts than rivers after much of the state had prepared for serious damage.
The high winds and sleet experienced overnight had, for the most part, subsided by early morning, although heavy rains continued in eastern Maine until shortly before noon.
Because of the heavy rainfall, the Department of Marine Resources announced a prohibition on harvesting clams, mussels and other bivalve mollusks along the entire Maine coast.
"Municipal treatment plants can't handle the amount of fresh water infiltrating their systems so they discharge raw sewage," Marine Patrol Sgt. John Bennett explained Wednesday.
Bennett said 3 inches of rain had fallen at the Marine Patrol's Division II headquarters in Lamoine, which covers the section of coast from Thomaston to the Canadian border. Similarly, Port Clyde received more than 4 inches of rain, Camden was drenched with more than 3 1/2, and about 2 1/2 inches fell on Portland, according to Tom Berman of the National Weather Service.
In Bangor, poor visibility was cited as the cause of a pedestrian accident involving a young boy. The 7-year-old pupil was crossing Fruit Street on his way to school when he was struck by a vehicle. He was taken by the Bangor Fire Ambulance to Eastern Maine Medical Center, was treated for minor injuries and later released.
"It was just a torrential downpour," firefighter Tom Goehringer said. "You couldn't see anything out there."
In Bar Harbor, four fender-benders were attributed to weather conditions, and one car was stranded in a deep puddle.
Shortly before noon, the National Weather Service upgraded flood conditions from a watch to a warning for the Kennebec River, which was expected to crest late Wednesday.
Still, the river level should not have any major impact on the area, according to Carl McKenney, Somerset County emergency management director. He expected there could be minor flooding along the East River Road or in the riverside areas in Madison and Anson.
While emergency management officials were keeping an eye out for minor flooding late Wednesday on the Androscoggin, Kennebec and Piscataquis rivers, predictions of a major storm never materialized. Though prepared for the worst, officials from across eastern Maine agreed that Wednesday's storm didn't compare to the one experienced last weekend.
While the Stillwater, Kenduskeag, and Penobscot rivers were high in some areas, there were no reports of flooding.
"Everything is over," Steve Watson, Penobscot County emergency management director, said late Wednesday afternoon.
In Bucksport, police dispatcher Byron Vinton said he had received only one weather-related call, a sharp contrast to the flurry produced by the weekend windstorm that ripped the roof from the vacant Western Auto building downtown.
The caller Wednesday provided the morning's only report of a tree down.
"I think all the rest blew down the other day," Vinton joked.
Even if little actually was blown down, Mother Nature provided plenty of huffing and puffing during the early hours of the storm.
In Bangor, winds peaked at 57 1/2 mph shortly before 10 a.m. The Coast Guard Base at Southwest Harbor reported gusts of more than 50 mph that sent several tree limbs crashing onto power lines in Mount Desert.
The strong winds forced a 65-foot fishing vessel, the Lady D, ashore at the head of the harbor in Southwest Harbor early Wednesday, a visible reminder of the gale-force winds that ushered in the latest round of slashing rain.
In Rockland, the harbor master's boat took on water to the gunwales overnight, and one of the city's floats was damaged by pounding waves. Otherwise, damage around town was minimal.
As with the weekend storm, most of the power outages reported by Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. were in the Hancock County area.
Some 450 customers were without power at 7 a.m. Wednesday, although most were corrected by evening. With pockets of outages in the Bangor and Machias areas, more than 120 residents of Hancock County were still without power at 5 p.m., according to Hydro spokesman Bill Cohen. Some of those, Cohen said, were leftovers from the weekend.
"We were down to being on top of all but about a dozen customers in the Hancock County area who were still out of power from Sunday's storm when this one hit,' Cohen said. "Hancock got the worst of it from both storms."
By late afternoon, Central Maine Power Co. reported 600 customers were without power as crews continued to clean up after the storm. Even that paled in comparison to the outages attributed to the weekend storm that knocked out power to an estimated 70,000 CMP customers.
In many towns across eastern Maine, public works departments were kept busy digging out leaves clogging culverts and storm drains. In some cases, the water backed up onto roads.
A low area near the Park Street entrance to the University of Maine was filled with enough rainwater Wednesday afternoon to resemble a small pond.
"It's just like a lake over there," Francis Dunn of the university's maintenance department said as he fished leaves from a drain. "There's nothing we can do about that one, though."
In Lamoine, several roads were impassable during the height of the storm.
The Waldo County Sheriff's Department reported that dips in the road along Route 139 in Monroe and Route 137 at Sanborn Pond in Waldo were submerged by flowing water for a time and needed to be flagged by the Department of Transportation.
"Other than that, we're in pretty good shape," a spokesman said. "It was nothing like last Sunday."
Town crews in Pittsfield and Hartland were monitoring minor flooding around culverts and small brooks throughout those areas, but did not anticipate any major problems.
A blocked culvert on West Street in Pittsfield compounded a traditional flooding problem on a branch of Farnham Brook. Upstream from the flooding, water was still rising at the J.W. Parks Golf Course at midday and undermined a covered foot bridge that collapsed into the stream.
The Lindsay Brook system in Rockland overflowed its banks in many areas, sending floodwater cascading down city streets and onto the waterfront. High winds loosened metal trim on the Syndicate Block and a light pole at the corner of Main and Rankin streets was tilted by the wind.
With the minor flooding, plumbers and firefighters across the area earned their money during the storm, as they helped many residents clear their cellars of unwelcome rainwater.
Some first-floor tenants at the Wildwood Apartment complex in Lincoln were evacuated temporarily after a culvert on the property plugged and flooded apartments with 4 to 5 inches of water, according to public safety officials. Damage was believed to be extensive, according to firefighter Bud Thornton.
In Howland, a town that borders both the Penobscot and Piscataquis rivers, town officials said there had been a few reports of minor basement flooding. The Pittsfield Fire Department was called to pump out the cellar at one home, as well as to clear clogged storm drains on the street.
On the coast, Camden, Thomaston and Rockport also experienced high water and backed-up drains and cellars.
"All in all, certainly for the quantity of rain, it was pretty routine," said Bangor Public Works Director Arthur Stockus.

Abstract: Even as voters leave the polls Tuesday, Nov. 7, after casting ballots on this year's referendum questions, they may be asked to sign petitions that could lead to referendum questions on next year's ballot. Five petition drives are under way to place questions on the 1996 ballot. The campaigns are in varying states of readiness to collect signatures on Election Day. A sixth campaign reportedly has enough signatures already to guarantee a spot on next year's ballot. In addition, activists motivated by Ross Perot's call to form a new political party will be seeking voters who want to join the Reform Party and help win a place for the new party on next year's ballot.

Those pushing for a referendum need to collect at least 51,131 voter signatures -- or 10 percent of the turnout for last year's gubernatorial election -- by 5 p.m. Jan. 29, 1996, to claim a spot on the ballot.
In addition, activists motivated by Ross Perot's call to form a new political party will be seeking voters who want to join the Reform Party and help win a place for the new party on next year's ballot.
Secretary of State Bill Diamond said petitioners must wait until after voters have cast their ballots to ask them to sign petitions. Election wardens decide how far away petitioners must be from voting booths.
Petitioners also are prohibited from campaigning, or wearing campaign buttons, on questions that are on this year's ballot, Diamond said.
The new Reform Party must collect 25,565 voter signatures -- or 5 percent of last year's gubernatorial election turnout -- by Dec. 14 in order to qualify for a spot on next year's ballot.
"We're not certain how close we are," said Stephen Bost, coordinator for the Reform Party in Maine, on Thursday. "We will have a heavy presence across the state on Election Day. We will certainly concentrate on cities and as many rural sites as possible. At this point, we're confident."
By signing the petition, voters are actually enrolling in the Reform Party. If the party's petition drive is deemed sufficient, the party will have to hold caucuses in every county and a state party convention before they are recognized, Diamond said.
The Reform Party was recognized in California this week and Bost said it is nearing recognition in Ohio.
Here's a look at petition drives that are under way:
Campaign finance reform -- The effort is jointly undertaken by 10 organizations including Common Cause of Maine and the League of Women Voters of Maine.
David Donnelly, a spokesman for the campaign, said this petition drive would limit what politicians can spend on Maine races for governor and the Legislature. The aim is to create incentives for candidates to spend 25 percent less than the average amount spent in these races.
The proposal also reduces the maximum amount of money that can be given to candidates by political-action committees and individuals. The maximum donation is reduced from $5,000 to $500 for PACs in the governor's race and to $250 in legislative races.
The proposal toughens enforcement of campaign-finance and election laws. It doubles lobbying fees to pay for better auditing of campaign-finance reports.
Donnelly said Maine Voters for Clean Elections expect to put 1,000 volunteers at polling places and to gather all their required signatures on Election Day.
Clear-cutting -- Members of the Green Party of Maine are circulating petitions that would ban clear-cutting in the unorganized townships, promote forest rehabilitation and encourage sustainable forest practices.
Jonathan K. Carter said the Green Party is looking for volunteers to collect petition signatures on Election Day. Interested people should contact the Green Party's office in Augusta.
Marijuana -- For the second year, Maine VOCALS are gathering signatures on petitions that would legalize marijuana.
Organizer Don Christen, leader of Maine VOCALS, said the proposal would legalize the use, growing and sale of marijuana. It would not be legal for minors younger than 18.
Christen said his group is looking for volunteers to collect signatures.
Motor fuel laws -- A petition drive organized by Belinda Gerry of Auburn seeks to overturn several recent mandates on car emissions and gasoline use.
Among other things, the proposal would prohibit state and federal governments from requiring the use of certain fuels; prohibit the state and federal governments from banning the sale of certain fuels; and prohibit the state and federal governments from starting any emission testing without approval by the Legislature and a statewide vote.
Diamond said there are constitutional problems with the petition, but he authorized the drive to start anyway because courts historically have chosen to decide constitutional questions after the proposals are considered by voters.
Clam digging -- David L. Sanborn, a Waldoboro clam digger, has started a petition drive that would do away with municipal shellfish regulations. Sanborn said his proposal would allow anyone to harvest clams, not just those now permitted by municipal ordinances. Sanborn said he doesn't know if he'll be at the polls Tuesday to collect signatures. He is looking for volunteers to work on his campaign.
Property tax cap -- Organizers say they have more than enough signatures to put a property-tax cap measure on the 1996 ballot. The proposal would cap property taxes in Maine at 1 percent of a home's current assessed value. Carol Palesky of Topsham is leader of the drive.
In addition to the active petition drives, two more are inactive.
A drive to require the state to pay 100 percent of the cost of local education is not actively seeking signatures and is short of the needed number of signatures.

It's all in the game Wild-bird recipes aren't exact science

Abstract: Partridge, pheasant, duck, and woodcock are some of the wild game birds Mainers have known and loved for generations. But for most of the state's hunters and game cooks, the partridge has earned a special place as a hands-down favorite. "I'd say that for most of the people going out to hunt (game) birds, partridge is the favorite," said Warden Kevin Adam of the Maine Warden Service. They are relatively plentiful in Maine, and not that difficult to bag. Some traditional Maine ways to cook game birds are stewing, sauteing, roasting, or -- in the case of partridge and woodcock -- baking them in the middle of a pot of beans.

Full text: Partridge, pheasant, duck, and woodcock are some of the wild game birds Mainers have known and loved for generations. But for most of the state's hunters and game cooks, the partridge has earned a special place as a hands-down favorite.
"I'd say that for most of the people going out to hunt (game) birds, partridge is the favorite," said Warden Kevin Adam of the Maine Warden Service. They are relatively plentiful in Maine, and not that difficult to bag.
And this fall is shaping up to be a banner partridge-hunting year in the northern part of Maine.
A mild winter, dry spring and ideal nesting conditions have resulted in a low mortality rate for partridge chicks and in some cases, second hatches.
Some traditional Maine ways to cook game birds are stewing, sauteing, roasting, or -- in the case of partridge and woodcock -- baking them in the middle of a pot of beans.
When it comes to the smaller species, such as partridge, game cookery can be tricky. The amount of meat the cook will have in the kitchen depends on the hunter's success -- or luck -- in the woods.
"They're mostly fluff," observes Robert Bulay of Old Town, who has achieved some local notoriety for his version of wild game stew. Once the feathers are plucked, there's not a whole lot left on the birds.
When my father, Don Daigle, offered to cook up a batch of partridge stir fry during a recent family gathering at our apartment in Bangor, I'll admit I was skeptical.
First of all, partridge doesn't exactly leap to mind when one considers stir-fry cookery.
And then I took a close look at the tiny, fragile-looking partridge breasts, and mentally counted out the five adults and two children who'd soon be seated around our kitchen table.
But Dad had already taken that into account and had picked up some chicken breasts as part of his contingency plan.
After he'd added a couple of large onions, sliced into long thin slivers, a package of sliced mushrooms, sliced red pepper and a little cornstarch and water to thicken the pan juices, the huge hunting-camp-sized skillet he'd brought with him from St. Agatha held enough stir fry for dinner that night and leftovers for a long afterward.
Seasoned with salt, pepper and soy sauce and smothered in vegetables, the patridge stir fry won raves for the dish that he first concocted from more basic ingredients during a hunting trip on the Maine-Quebec border.
Wild game stew is a family favorite in Bulay's household. His directions are simple and generic. Any stewable game -- partridge, rabbit and venison, to name a few, alone or in combinations -- can be used.
"You're not actually cooking," Bulay maintains. The stew practically makes itself. All the cook has to do is get it started, and toss the vegetables in when the time is right.
To some, the image of a pot of stew gently bubbling on the stove top evokes memories of a simpler era, a time when cookstoves served the dual role of heating meals and warming homes.
"This is not a quick thing," noted Bulay, for whom making stew is a daylong affair.
Bulay starts by putting the game, bones and all, in a pot with water and bringing the pot to a boil. He then leaves it to simmer away until the bones can be picked out of the pot, and the liquid has reduced itself to a rich broth.
Then he adds vegetables. Which ones are a matter of individual taste, or family preference.
As for amounts, he said, "You have to guesstimate." By his rule of thumb, the ratio should be somewhere between one-fourth and one-third part meat to vegetables.
Bulay recommends that the "harder" vegetables, the ones that need the most time to cook, go in the pot first. These would include chunks of carrot, turnip, beets or whole onions.
When these begin to soften, it's time to add the potato pieces. And when the potatoes are tender, in go the small vegetables such as peas or kernels of corn. By the time the latter are heated through, the stew is done.
"At the point where everything is done, I might taste it," Bulay said. Most of the time his stew is perfect -- or so he alleges. But once in a while, it needs a little kick. On those rare occasions, Bulay adds a splash or two of tamari, a Japanese version of soy sauce.
He never adds salt during the cooking process because, he says, it toughens meat. The time to salt is, "When you put the food on your plate." And only if your dinner needs it.
Recipes for wild game birds are difficult to find in mainstream cooking publications. Some of those who cook them best learned by doing or were the beneficiaries of methods passed along by earlier generations.
But for those of us who need specific directions when cooking, such as exact amounts and cooking times, Louise O. Kirkland, an extension educator from the Penobscot County office of the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, offers the following:
PAN-FRIED PARTRIDGE OR PHEASANT
2 birds, cleaned 2 tablespoons flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons softened margarine 2 tablespoons hot water 1 cup cream Dash each of pepper and celery salt
Cut cleaned birds in half lengthwise. Combine flour, salt, pepper and celery salt. Dredge each portion thoroughly in flour mixture. Heat margarine in heavy frying pan. Sear, cook over low heat until game is tender. Add mixture of hot water and cream during cooking.
DUCK GUMBO
4 slices bacon, diced 1 cup chopped onion 1/4 cup flour 2 quarts boiling water 1/4 teaspoon pepper 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup chopped parsley 2 tablespoons gumbo file powder 6 cups cooked rice 1 duck, 3 1/2 to 4 pounds, cut up 2 cups shrimp, shelled 2 cups cooked tomatoes 1 cup chopped green onion 1 pint shucked oysters
In a heavy kettle, fry bacon until crisp. Add chopped onion, saute until lightly browned. Stir in flour, add boiling water, salt and pepper. Stir well. Add duck. Add more water to cover, if needed. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Cool, skim fat from top. Add shrimp and tomatoes, cook 20 more minutes. Remove from heat. Add green onion, parsley, gumbo file and oysters. Serve over rice. (Makes 8 to 10 servings.)
CASSEROLE OF PARTRIDGE
Partridge breasts, legs 1 carrot, sliced 2 onions, sliced 3/4 pound mushrooms, sliced 1 can cream of mushroom soup 1/2 cup milk 1 large can chow mein noodles Salt, pepper
In water to cover, parboil partridge breasts and legs with carrot and onion for about 30 minutes. Drain water, remove meat from bones. Mix together meat, mushrooms, soup diluted with milk and noodles. Taste, seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary. Turn into well-buttered casserole dish. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours.
ROAST WILD DUCK
2 1/2 pound wild duck, cleaned 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/2 cups diced celery 1/2 cup diced onion 1/2 cup chopped raisins 2 cups bread crumbs 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup water 3 slices bacon 1 cup orange juice 1/4 cup sugar
Rub inside and outside of duck with baking soda, rinse and dry. Combine celery, onion, raisins, bread crumbs, salt and water. Stuff mixture into cavity, fasten closed with skewers. Place duck on rack in roasting pan. Cover breasts with strips of bacon. Bake uncovered at 500 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake for about two hours, basting with orange juice and sugar.
PHEASANT EN CREME
1 pheasant, cleaned and quartered 1 10-ounce can condensed cream of chicken soup 1/2 cup apple cider 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup chopped onion 1 clove garlic 1 3-ounce can sliced mushrooms, drained Paprika
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Place pheasant in ungreased 9x9x2-inch baking dish. Mix soup, cider, Worcestershire sauce, salt, onion, garlic and mushrooms. Pour mixture over pheasant. Sprinkle generously with paprika. Serves two or three.

Abstract: During "the rush hour," two hunters (right) hurry to get the decoys set before legal shooting time. They are pleasantly distracted, however, by the sound of air passing through primary wing feathers as a pair of black ducks scale out of the dawn sky. Decoys are set in purposeful disarray to imitate ducks that are resting and feeding comfortably. Some hunters prefer oversize decoys, which they believe are more visible to trafficking ducks. Discussions about the number of decoys necessary for attracting ducks are as endless as arguments about which chokes and shot sizes are most efficient for bagging the swift-winged fowl. Generally speaking, a good rule of thumb regarding decoys is "big water, big rig; small water, small rig." Big water usually refers to late-season hunting on coastal bays, where the adage, "The more the merrier," is worth remembering when rigging decoys. Often, a "confidence decoy" simulating a great blue heron - a marsh bird that doesn't tolerate human intrusion - is set near decoys to increase the all-is-well deception. Maine's sprawling marshlands, both coastal and inland, attract many species of ducks. Among the most common are black ducks, mallards, teal, wood ducks, whistlers, ringnecks and buffleheads.

During "the rush hour," two hunters (right) hurry to get the decoys set before legal shooting time. They are pleasantly distracted, however, by the sound of air passing through primary wing feathers as a pair of black ducks scale out of the dawn sky. Decoys are set in purposeful disarray to imitate ducks that are resting and feeding comfortably. Some hunters prefer oversize decoys, which they believe are more visible to trafficking ducks.
Discussions about the number of decoys necessary for attracting ducks are as endless as arguments about which chokes and shot sizes are most efficient for bagging the swift-winged fowl. Generally speaking, a good rule of thumb regarding decoys is "big water, big rig; small water, small rig." Big water usually refers to late-season hunting on coastal bays, where the adage, "The more the merrier," is worth remembering when rigging decoys.
Often, a "confidence decoy" simulating a great blue heron - a marsh bird that doesn't tolerate human intrusion - is set near decoys to increase the all-is-well deception. Maine's sprawling marshlands, both coastal and inland, attract many species of ducks. Among the most common are black ducks, mallards, teal, wood ducks, whistlers, ringnecks and buffleheads.
Paddling and shooting
Caught off guard by the silent approach of the canoe (left), a pair of black ducks flush from behind an outcropping of willows wading the edge of a thoroughfare. Maine is blessed with an abundance of bogs, flowages and marshy waterways where jump-shooting from a canoe can be productive. Success, however, depends entirely on how quietly the canoe is handled. Black ducks are extremely wary and will flush out of range at the slightest splash or swirl of the paddle or scraping of weeds and stumps against the canoe. At the start of a jump-shoot, paddler and shooter positions usually are determined by the flip of a coin. The hunters switch positions after each shooting opportunity.
Hunter's best friend
The importance of a retriever to waterfowl conservation cannot be overemphasized. An experienced finder-and-fetcher will recover many crippled ducks that would be lost otherwise, especially in the spongy, hummocky hell of swamps and bogs. Because retrievers often recover ducks that were shot and lost by other hunters, discussions are not uncommon regarding the allowance of an extra duck in the daily limits of hunters who use trained retrievers. Aside from the conservation factor, watching an experienced retriever at work is pure pleasure. Also, unlike some hunting partners, the dog doesn't forget to set the alarm and never has to go home early.
Dawn's early light
When a Down Easter says he's "goin' birdin," it's likely he's headed for an offshore ledge to hunt eider ducks (left). And that, you may know, can be cold, rough, dangerous sport. Setting a line of decoys and landing on ledges when dawn is hinting at daylight and the tide's running hard requires seamanship, nerve, and the ability to convince yourself you'd rather be there than home in bed. But when the first flock of eiders tip their wings toward your decoys, there's no place you'd rather be.
The big sea ducks are insulated with down that sheds shot like a retriever shaking off water. Therefore, bring nothing less than a 12-gauge gun and plenty of shells marked No. 2. Tides, of course, are the governing factors in offshore gunning. Although decent shooting may occur at any tide levels, the best-by-far chance to warm barrels in a hurry is when low water and dawn coincide. That's when night-rafted eiders begin winging toward ledges to dive and feed on mussels and other mollusks.
Suffice it to say, the shooting can be fast and furious. Currently, it is estimated that nearly 60,000 adult eiders inhabit Maine's coast, and there are dawns when it seems the ducks are all in the air at the same time.
Without question, it's an awe-inspiring spectacle, but hunters shouldn't let it distract them from keeping an eye on winds, tides - and their boats. As one Down East gunner put it: "If a man's boat gets away from him out here, he'd better have either an Olympic medal in swimming or one hell of a high pair of waders."

Maine nets top fisheries revenue High 1994 figure attributed to efforts to market wider variety of seafood

Abstract: WOODS HOLE, Mass. -- Maine has surpassed Massachusetts as the top commercial fisheries state in New England, landing some $245.4 million worth of marine species last year -- a $20 million jump in revenue over 1993 -- National Marine Fisheries Service sources report. The Woods Hole-based Northeast Fisheries Science Center, a branch of the NMFS, released the report this month. Spokesman Teri Frady attributes Maine's rise to the top slot in seafood revenue to the state's diversification in fisheries over the years. "Maine, particularly as a state, has broadened the species that it lands," Frady said, noting Maine has a strong finfish aquaculture industry that generates more revenue than any other marine species after lobster. She said, "Maine has not been as dependent on cod and yellowtail flounder as Massachusetts."

Full text: WOODS HOLE, Mass. -- Maine has surpassed Massachusetts as the top commercial fisheries state in New England, landing some $245.4 million worth of marine species last year -- a $20 million jump in revenue over 1993 -- National Marine Fisheries Service sources report.
Virginia landed more fish -- some 581.3 million pounds -- than any other state, but ranked third in revenue. Menhaden accounted for the bulk of that state's catch. Massachusetts took second place with 183.3 million pounds worth $206 million harvested last year.
The Woods Hole-based Northeast Fisheries Science Center, a branch of the NMFS, released the report this month. Spokesman Teri Frady attributes Maine's rise to the top slot in seafood revenue to the state's diversification in fisheries over the years.
"Maine, particularly as a state, has broadened the species that it lands," Frady said, noting Maine has a strong finfish aquaculture industry that generates more revenue than any other marine species after lobster. She said, "Maine has not been as dependent on cod and yellowtail flounder as Massachusetts."
Frady said Massachusetts has an aquaculture industry -- striped bass are being raised there in the town of Turner's Falls -- but it is not on the same scale as Maine, where salmon, trout, mussels, oysters and other marine species are cultivated.
After pen-raised finfish, Maine's sea urchin fishery is the third-largest moneymaker after lobster. Some 38.3 million pounds of the spiny green creatures were harvested last year, netting $33.1 million in revenue.
Bob Morrill, longtime statistician at the Portland office of the NMFS, says Maine has always been more diversified in its fisheries.
"Seaweed, worm diggers, offshore fishing, inshore fishing, Maine people have always been the real opportunists," he said. "The guy that's digging clams in the summer might be scalloping in the winter and hauling lobsters the next summer."
While Maine's revenue from commercial fisheries is up, the state's overall landings are on the decline. Some 233.9 million pounds of marine species were harvested last year, compared with 251.7 million in 1993. The same is true throughout the New England region, where landings dropped from 1.649 million pounds to 1.470 million over the past two years.
Morrill attributes the decline to the dramatic reduction of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder stocks on Georges Bank and in the Gulf of Maine.
"I think it's a real indicator of the status of the stocks," he said.

Wok This Way Top chef teaches Chinese cooking to hungry pupils

Abstract: The idea of a world-class chef offering Chinese cooking classes from a rural Pittsfield farmhouse is intriguing. What is a New York restaurant owner, operator of three Chinese restaurants, doing in Pittsfield, and why in the world is he teaching cooking, giving away his secrets? "I want to share. You won't find anything healthier than Chinese food. No fat. No grease. All fresh vegetables," said Young, who also boasts that he uses no preservatives or monosodium glutamate in his cooking. "Chinese people avoid diabetes, heart attacks and high blood pressure. But Peter Young doesn't really cook Chinese food. What Peter Young does is dance with Chinese food. He's like a little bee, buzzing around the kitchen, vigorously washing vegetables, chopping bok choy at a dizzying pace, throwing the stir-fry ingredients up in the air as they sizzle, and then gracefully sliding the completed dish onto a huge decorated platter.

Full text: The idea of a world-class chef offering Chinese cooking classes from a rural Pittsfield farmhouse is intriguing. What is a New York restaurant owner, operator of three Chinese restaurants, doing in Pittsfield, and why in the world is he teaching cooking, giving away his secrets?
With a twinkle in his eye, Peter Young tells all.
"I want to share. You won't find anything healthier than Chinese food. No fat. No grease. All fresh vegetables," said Young, who also boasts that he uses no preservatives or monosodium glutamate in his cooking. "Chinese people avoid diabetes, heart attacks and high blood pressure.
"That's why I teach," he said. "I want to help share my experience cooking with the public."
But Peter Young doesn't really cook Chinese food. What Peter Young does is dance with Chinese food. He's like a little bee, buzzing around the kitchen, vigorously washing vegetables, chopping bok choy at a dizzying pace, throwing the stir-fry ingredients up in the air as they sizzle, and then gracefully sliding the completed dish onto a huge decorated platter.
Don't expect a Julia Child look-alike or act-alike when you sign up. Young will most likely greet his new students in a sweatshirt and a ball cap, perched a little sideways on his head. And his classes come with a little "interpretation sheet" to help new students understand Young's heavy Chinese accent.
Right in the middle of roasting pork, he is as likely as not to launch into a story about serving egg foo yong to Barbra Streisand while he was a chef in New York. Or he might tell about his wife's career in Washington, D.C., as a court reporter during the Watergate hearings.
As Young cooks, his students take notes -- and drool. From the minute the first garlic bit hits the wok, the wonderful smells make it hard to wait until the end of class to fill your plate and eat.
At 69, Young is a testament to the healthful content of his cooking -- not a wrinkle creases his face. He takes no medication and is in perfect health, looking (and acting) much like a 40-year-old. Aside from teaching up to three classes a day, he maintains the family farm, tending chickens and ducks and a small herd of Holsteins.
Young often gives cooking seminars, at no charge, to local groups, and has provided healthful-cooking classes for businesses, schools and community gatherings. As part of a charity fund-raiser in 1991, he made more than 1,300 egg rolls in three days at the Pittsfield Egg Festival.
Young began his cooking career as a young boy in New York. He started out as a dishwasher and learned each level of Chinese cooking from master chefs, one step at a time. Born in China, he once turned down an opportunity to be a Chinese translator in the United Nations, when it was forming in the early 1950s.
"It only paid $45 a week," he recalled. "Dishwashing paid $50 a week, and that included all my meals and room and board."
As he worked his way through New York restaurants, Young invested in commodities and did well. And he traveled around the world, sampling food of other cultures.
In 1983, Young relocated to Maine and bought the former Anchorage Inn in Old Town, renaming it The Joy King. After his retirement in 1985, he gave the restaurant to his son.
But during his retirement, Young kept being asked over and over again to teach Chinese cooking. He often did demonstrations, and eventually, in 1991, he was persuaded to start a class. Over the years, the chef has developed a series of four classes, each specializing in a specific curriculum of 64 different Chinese dishes. He is now being pressured by alumni to add a fifth class.
Who takes these classes? State troopers, auto repairmen, lawyers, store clerks and me.
I really thought I knew how to cook Chinese food. I knew how to make rice, and I could stir-fry vegetables and meat. But the exotic terms used in the recipes -- subgum, gai din, lo mein -- confused me. Over the past few years, I kept hearing about Peter Young's classes. Everywhere I went, every time the subject of cooking came up, someone began raving about Young's classes.
What could be so special? I wondered. So I signed up, at $50 for eight classes (which include two main-course dishes), during which you get to eat the meals cooked. I figured that even if I didn't learn anything, I'd at least get eight meals for less than $7 each.
I got a lot more.
I got a crash course in healthful, substantial cooking which not only has made me a hit with my friends and family, but also has simplified my meal planning -- a big bonus for a working mom. Now, we often have a luscious dinner of beef lo mein (whipped up in 20 minutes) or a feast of teriyaki beef and pork fried rice -- all at a fraction of the cost of restaurant dinners.
I guess one of the clearest testaments to the popularity of Young's classes has been the appearance of decidedly Chinese offerings at the local supermarkets.
Five years ago, you couldn't have found bok choy or straw mushrooms in any of Pittsfield's grocery stores. Thanks to pressure from Young's students, bok choy and other Chinese offerings are now readily available locally.
The first thing Young's students notice is his energy level -- and his accent. Then we notice his manner of cooking, everything done with care, dignity and design -- and with health in mind.
Everything that can be used fresh, is. Only specialty Chinese-grown products -- such as bamboo shoots and water chestnuts -- are used from cans.
"Fresh. Fresh. That is the secret to good, healthy cooking," he testified.
Young will start a new round of classes in October. Typical beginning classes inlcude teriyaki steak, egg rolls and Chinese roast pork.
Other classes offer wonton soup, chicken fingers, sweet and sour pork, and a seafood selection. There are more than 64 recipes in Young's class offerings. Classes are limited to a maximum of 12 students. Information about his classes may be obtained by calling 487-5379.
Young's recipes at first may sound lengthy, time-consuming or complicated, but most of the actual time is involved in chopping and preparing the ingredients. Nearly all ingredients can be found at large supermarkets or bought through Young.
Almost all of this preparation can be done ahead of time. A Sunday afternoon of chopping usually yields enough items for two or three meals during the week. Sealed in bags, the meats marinate wonderfully, and the crisp vegetables remain fresh for days.
When actual mealtime comes, I grab several bags from the refrigerator and can serve a full-course Chinese meal in less than half an hour. Cleanup is one pan and the serving dishes. What could be easier, more delicious or more healthful?
This recipe sounds like a lot of work -- it isn't -- but the results are incredible.
Moo Goo Gai Pan
3 large, whole chicken breasts, skinned and boned
Marinade: 1/8 cup light soy sauce 1/8 cup vegetable oil 1 tablespoon cornstarch
Vegetables:
1 medium-size bok choy, sliced into strips, washed and drained 1 package celery hearts, cut into chunks, washed and drained 12 ounces mushrooms, sliced 1 8-ounce can water chestnuts, drained and sliced 1 8-ounce can bamboo shoots, drained 1 8-ounce package fresh snow pea pods
1/8 cup vegetable oil 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic 1/8 cup oyster sauce 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 cup light soy sauce 1 1/2 cups chicken stock 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup cornstarch
Prepare the chicken breasts. Slice into small pieces and chunks (Young's tip: Place breasts shiny side down -- they won't slide on the cutting block when being sliced.). Marinate the chicken overnight in the marinade.
Prepare vegetables (this can be done when preparing meat and then refrigerate them, or prepare just before the cooking commences).
When ready to cook, heat the wok on high heat and put in the vegetable oil. Add the garlic and brown. Add chicken, still in marinade, and oyster sauce. Cook two to three minutes. Remove from wok.
Add all the prepared vegetables to the wok, execpt the snow pea pods. Cover and cook six to seven minutes, then add salt, soy sauce and chicken stock. Bring to a boil. Put chicken on top of vegetables. Add pea pods.
Leave a hole in the center of food and when the juices begin to boil, add the water, mixed with the cornstarch, to thicken. Stir well and serve with rice.
For this recipe, Young says: "Don't forget to wash the rice before cooking so the starch is rinsed away and the rice won't stick together." Rinse in cold water until the milky starch is washed away.
Pork Fried Rice
3 1/2 cups raw rice
2 pounds roast pork, sliced thin and then chopped fine 1 Spanish onion, chopped fine 1 bunch scallions, chopped fine 1 pound bean sprouts, fresh or canned
1/2 cup vegetable oil 4 eggs 1/8 cup oil 1/8 cup light soy sauce 1/4 cup dark soy sauce Pepper
Cook the rice either conventionally or with a rice cooker.
In a hot wok, heat the vegetable oil and scramble the four eggs quickly. Cook until they are dry, remove from wok.
Add 1/8 cup oil and saute the onions. Add roast pork and rice. Add light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and a dash of pepper. Cook two to three minutes.
Add the remaining vegetables and eggs and cook until heated through.

Abstract: The 8-year-old Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery will reorganize its governing structure in an effort to raise enough money to keep the hatchery alive. According to hatchery officials, $50,000 must be raised this year. Brian Beal, an assistant professor of marine ecology at UMM, said Monday that the meeting in the conference room of the science building will be the first of a series of critical meetings aimed at funding the hatchery, clarifying its geographic service area, and focusing the hatchery on the production of specific species of fish. "The selection and geographic makeup of the board will be critical to the hatchery's future and mission," Beal said, because the hatchery will continue to carry a strong influence in the service area that ranges from Kittery to Eastport. "If we can establish a board, we will move ahead. If we cannot get a board, that could end the hatchery."

Full text: MACHIAS -- The 8-year-old Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery will reorganize its governing structure in an effort to raise enough money to keep the hatchery alive. According to hatchery officials, $50,000 must be raised this year.
An ad hoc steering committee will meet at 10 a.m. Friday at the University of Maine at Machias to create a new mission statement and nominate a 12-member board of directors.
Brian Beal, an assistant professor of marine ecology at UMM, said Monday that the meeting in the conference room of the science building will be the first of a series of critical meetings aimed at funding the hatchery, clarifying its geographic service area, and focusing the hatchery on the production of specific species of fish.
After the committee produces the list of candidates for a board of directors, Beal will conduct informal interviews with each candidate before selecting the hatchery's initial board of directors.
"The selection and geographic makeup of the board will be critical to the hatchery's future and mission," Beal said, because the hatchery will continue to carry a strong influence in the service area that ranges from Kittery to Eastport. "If we can establish a board, we will move ahead. If we cannot get a board, that could end the hatchery."
A new board would be commissioned at its first meeting with organizational consultant Alan Reid of York Harbor. Reid, a consultant to philanthropic and charitable organizations, was hired by the hatchery to coach the new directors on fund raising and other skills needed for developing the hatchery as a catalyst for shellfish management in Maine.
Part of Reid's fee will be paid from a $3,500 grant that Beal acquired in July. The Collaboration of Community Foundations for the Gulf of Maine awarded the grant for the specific purpose of building an organizational structure for the hatchery. Some of the money will meet the cost of legal work needed to give the hatchery a nonprofit status.
Beal, who created the hatchery nine years ago, was supported by UMM in his endeavors as the hatchery's chief consultant. The hatchery has been operated under the auspices of UMM, and it has received numerous grants from state and national organizations interested in shellfish management.
"The grants were used, in part, to hire the hatchery's staff," he said, adding that the university has permitted him to serve as a part-time consultant until Dec. 31. "Due to changes in fiscal policy and additional faculty positions, UMM will no longer be able to play the role it has in the past. This presents the Regional Shellfish Hatchery program with a challenge and an opportunity," Beal said.
He expects the new board of directors to greatly enhance the work of the hatchery as a statewide public demonstration facility.
He said Maine clammers and coastal communities are finally beginning to see that the Regional Shellfish Hatchery represents real education and economic opportunities. "The facility can serve to retrain fishermen interested in shellfish aquaculture so that they begin to farm the ocean rather than hunt in the ocean."
The facility, because of its enormous production capacity for bivalves and crustaceans, can produce clams and other marine species for public stock enhancement or for growing on private leases. "There are a number of ways for the program to effect financial changes in the lives of fishermen and their families," he said.
The hatchery program has reached a point where "it is seen by many as a necessary and welcome player in the future health of shellfish aquaculture in Maine, particularly Down East," he stated.
The mission statement and a list of candidates for the first board of directors will be decided by Albert Carver of Carver Shellfish Co. of Beals; Dwayne Shaw, hatchery manager; Samuel Chapman, aquaculture coordinator for the Time & Tide Resource Conservation and Development Council at Augusta; William Hopkins of the Sustainable Cobscook Project at Eastport; Michael Hastings, aquaculture innovation center at Brewer; David Dow, marine advisory program leader for the Maine Sea Grant College Program at the University of Maine; Paul Thompson, aquaculture farmer at Cutler; Gayle Krause, professor of marine ecology at UMM; Jane Hinson, director of UMM special programs; and Beal.

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- Still coping with recession-induced staff cutbacks from 1991, the state Department of Marine Resources is planning to slash 21 more jobs from its depleted ranks to help Gov. Angus King meet his budget goal.
King's Productivity Realization Task Force has pledged to come up with at least $45 million in budget savings by January.
Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden on Wednesday proposed consolidating a number of functions within her department and the phaseout of the agency's South Portland office.
Of the 21 positions targeted for elimination, most are clerical in nature. Only 12 are funded under the state's General Fund where the bottom-line savings are realized.
Alden estimated her reorganization plans would provide about $335,000 in savings for the balance of the fiscal year. She was pleased that none of the positions scheduled for elimination is from the enforcement division, where marine patrol officers represent the agency's front line.
"If it goes through as proposed, we have maintained the entire field capability," she said. "We haven't touched that at all. All we've done is streamline management by reducing some staff in the special services division."
Alden plans to consolidate all of the department's biological science functions under a reorganized management, eliminating and downgrading some supervisory positions. She also plans to consolidate the department's water quality, seafood inspection and toxins monitoring responsibilities under a single manager.
While some legislators have demanded greater efforts at consolidation among departments sharing common missions, there are clearly some instances in which seemingly simple tasks quickly become more complex. The departments of Agriculture, Human Services and Marine Resources all inspect food, for example. But Alden maintained it would be necessary for her division to retain authority for inspection of seafood because the process itself is extremely rigorous.
"It's more {rigorous} than agriculture because the product is a live product and therefore the rules are much stricter for the types of surfaces that you have and types of cleaning agents you must use -- it's down to the real minutiae," she said.
Like other department heads before her, however, Alden said she would be happy to pick up the inspection roles of competing departments. She offered one example where a Maine plant might process both crabmeat and shellfish.
State law gives the state Agriculture Department responsibility for crabmeat inspections, while Marine Resources is charged with inspecting shellfish.
"Through a memorandum of understanding, we could go in and do the agriculture inspection as well, so the public would only have one state person walking through the door," she said. "Clearly we ought to be working toward that, because the shellfish program is so rigorous and the Food and Drug Administration oversees it so tightly. My feeling about productivity is that the growing areas in the plants and the toxins should all be under one state agency."
Alden's report was presented to a subcommittee of the cost-cutting panel. The full task force will meet at 1 p.m. Sept. 20 in Room 228 of the State House to discuss the proposed

Abstract: I regarded my lottery ticket despairingly -- once again the winning numbers had eluded me. For more than three years, I have invested a dollar a week in the Tri-State Megabucks so that I can hasten my ship coming in, but to no avail. In my fantasy, there I am, a Megabucks winner, hobnobbing with the rich and famous on a yacht in the Mediterranean. And there I am again, mingling with the affluent, the opulent and the well-to-do in Monte Carlo. My reveries know no bounds -- oh, the sights I would see, the things I would do and the magic which would unfold when the pot of gold at the end of my rainbow was finally discovered. A world tour would be first on my agenda. Bangor Travel helped me find one that cost a mere $33,900 for 23 days. A chauffeured limousine picks me up from my home and whisks me to the airport for a first-class flight to New York. There, my private jet, stocked with gourmet meals and wines, carries me to the likes of Marrakech, Prague, Saudi Arabia and Bangkok. I traverse the desert on a hot air balloon; I tremble with excitement as a game run thunders past me across the African plain; I let the tropical forest in Rio de Janeiro enfold me and make me one. Truly, the world is my oyster.

Full text: I regarded my lottery ticket despairingly -- once again the winning numbers had eluded me. For more than three years, I have invested a dollar a week in the Tri-State Megabucks so that I can hasten my ship coming in, but to no avail.
Even though the gods have yet to smile upon me, still I continue to be captivated by the lure of the good life. When the Megabucks' advertisements urge viewers to "just imagine," that's exactly what I do.
In my fantasy, there I am, a Megabucks winner, hobnobbing with the rich and famous on a yacht in the Mediterranean. And there I am again, mingling with the affluent, the opulent and the well-to-do in Monte Carlo. My reveries know no bounds -- oh, the sights I would see, the things I would do and the magic which would unfold when the pot of gold at the end of my rainbow was finally discovered.
In the 10 years since the Tri-State Megabucks lottery was started, 288 people -- most of them from Maine -- have found their pots of gold. Payouts total more than $560 million, with the largest -- $16.4 million -- won Jan. 25, 1992. Megabucks officials are celebrating the lottery's anniversary this month by adding $50,000 to each September jackpot.
Somehow this most recent devastation seems like the last straw. That's it, I vow, I've had it! The Megabucks computer wouldn't have me to kick around anymore; the lottery coffers would never again be padded by my dollar bills. Pie in the sky may be fine for others, but from now on, I'll take the high road.
Yet I couldn't help but allow myself one last dream of winning The Big One and being able to satisfy my every whim. So, then, if this is to be my last fantasy, nothing would do but it must be my most decadent, my most hedonistic, my most self-indulgent yet. Why, I grow heady just thinking about it ...
A world tour would be first on my agenda. Bangor Travel helped me find one that cost a mere $33,900 for 23 days. A chauffeured limousine picks me up from my home and whisks me to the airport for a first-class flight to New York. There, my private jet, stocked with gourmet meals and wines, carries me to the likes of Marrakech, Prague, Saudi Arabia and Bangkok. I traverse the desert on a hot air balloon; I tremble with excitement as a game run thunders past me across the African plain; I let the tropical forest in Rio de Janeiro enfold me and make me one. Truly, the world is my oyster.
It's only fitting that someone as rich as Croesus dress the part. I must be bedecked and bejeweled. Graduate gemologist Bruce Kaley of Perfect Proportions in Bangor advises me to purchase a flawless, pure-white, perfectly cut, 1-karat round diamond. It comes with a price tag of $40,000, but, explains Kaley, it's a great investment -- guaranteed to increase in value each year. A platinum setting? But of course!
Naturally, my comfort must never be compromised; and nothing less than a mink coat will ensure my ability to withstand the winter winds. And so, in the time-honored tradition of the well-dressed millionaire, I choose a full-length, mahogany-colored, custom-made ranch mink. Bob Pushard, vice president of operations of World Traders in Brewer, says I can expect to pay between $3,000 and $5,000. "OK!" I agree cheerfully.
Nor would it ever do for a millionaire to be without a place to unwind. Rig Reese, director of marketing at The Hinckley Co. in Southwest Harbor, suggests a 70-foot sailboat with cherry interior, complete with a microwave, air conditioning and computer -- in fact, with all the comforts of home -- so that I am never, ever inconvenienced, even when docked in the Caribbean or the South Seas. It'll run me around $3 million, he says. "Why not?" I decide.
Constant traveling may become tedious, however. I must have a place to hang my hat, I realize; a place to call home. Karen Koos of Saltmeadow Properties in Castine and Blue Hill tells me about a 14-room mansion on the ocean in Blue Hill. At $1.2 million, with more than 5,000 square feet of living space and its own dock, I deem it a worthy investment.
And because a girl's gotta have transportation, I'm off to Village Car Co. in Bangor. I've got my heart set on a sporty, two-door Mercedes Benz SL convertible -- in red, what else? I consider it a bargain at $80,000.
And then it occurs to me that I really must stop this extravagance.
Financial adviser Lindon S. Brown II of the Brown Co. in Bangor says that even Megabucks millionaires must have a budget and a financial plan. Winners should buy "toys," he explains, only after they have put some of their windfall in the bank or invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds or even real estate.
In fact, Kim Moore, spokeswoman for the Tri State Lotto Commission in Manchester, N.H., says the majority of the Megabucks winners during the past 10 years have done just that.
Most have been "very conservative with their money," she says, using their winnings to pay bills, take a family trip or to make improvements to their homes or businesses. "Very few" have squandered their windfalls, says Moore.
Frederick Ayer of Newport, for instance, who won $373,000 in 1987, used his winnings to start his own trucking business. Ayer and his wife, Christine, also built a house and bought a time-share condominium, a camper and a couple of new vehicles.
The Ayers, who will receive $12,500 for 12 more years, agree that it's a comforting thought to know that a check will arrive each year. And, while they may have done a bit of splurging the first couple of years, Christine Ayer explains that intelligent managing of the money really does come "once the novelty wears off."
Meanwhile, Russell Shepherd of Bangor, who won $480,000 last year, says the money will make it easier for him to attend college and, later, to buy a bed-and-breakfast on the coast. Their Megabucks earnings of $16,000 a year for 20 years have enabled Shepherd and his wife, Lynne, to buy a camper, a house and a new truck, and to put money aside for their retirement.
"Is there a downside to winning the Megabucks?" I ask him, thinking of King Midas and the blessing that become a bane.
"Yeah -- that the checks will end!"
We both guffaw.
One Megabucks winner talks grimly about a drawback, however. After he won several million dollars a couple of years ago, the man, who wants to remain anonymous, says that there's no question but that he was happier before.
"Life has become too complicated," he says. "Too many people ready to take advantage of me."
See? I tell myself sternly. There's a perfectly good reason to forego purchasing a Megabucks ticket each week. Still -- while I know money doesn't buy happiness -- there's something to be said for instant gratification.
And, it seems such a small thing in which to indulge. Really, what harm can it do? And there! I've found a dollar in my pocket ...

Abstract: New Bedford, Mass., edged out Portland last year to reclaim its title as New England's top fishing port, but it was a race in the wrong direction. According to 1994 totals just released by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Fisheries Service, 65.8 million pounds of seafood were landed at the Massachusetts port, good for 18th place nationally. Portland's 63.9 million placed the city right behind, in 19th place. The only other New England ports on the federal agency's Top 60 list are Port Judith, R.I., in 20th place with 62 million pounds; Gloucester, Mass., in 22nd place with 50 million pounds; Rockland in 27th with 34 million pounds; and Provincetown, Mass., in 39th with 18 million pounds.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- New Bedford, Mass., edged out Portland last year to reclaim its title as New England's top fishing port, but it was a race in the wrong direction.
According to 1994 totals just released by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Fisheries Service, 65.8 million pounds of seafood were landed at the Massachusetts port, good for 18th place nationally. Portland's 63.9 million placed the city right behind, in 19th place.
The value of landings is a different story. New Bedford placed third nationally at $82.4 million and Portland was 10th at $43.6 million.
The only other New England ports on the federal agency's Top 60 list are Port Judith, R.I., in 20th place with 62 million pounds; Gloucester, Mass., in 22nd place with 50 million pounds; Rockland in 27th with 34 million pounds; and Provincetown, Mass., in 39th with 18 million pounds.
The collapse of haddock, cod and flounder stocks in the North Atlantic has all New England ports trending downward. The groundfish-reliant Massachusetts ports have been especially hard hit, seeing their pounds and dollars cut in half in two years.
Since 1992, New Bedford has tumbled from eighth place in quantity, and has dropped from a strong second on the money list to a distant third. During that same period, Gloucester has fallen from ninth in landings and 12th in value.
Bouyed by several years of record and near-record lobster harvests, Portland hasn't fallen quite so far -- in 1992 and 1993, the Maine port was ranked 14th in quantity and sixth in value.
In 1993, a drastic decline in groundfish landings and attractive prices that lured fishermen to fish auctions in Portland pushed the city past New Bedford for the first time, but the traditional order was restored last year.
The nation's leading port, for the seventh year in a row, is Dutch Harbor-Unalaska, Alaska, landing nearly 700 million pounds of fish, worth $224 million. The Alaskan port held on to its ranking despite a drop of nearly 100 million pounds caused by a decline in polllock and halibut landings.
The No. 2 and No. 3 ports -- Empire-Venice and Cameron, both in Louisiana -- have gone from also-rans to strong challengers because of a booming menhaden catch. Eight of the top 10 ports are either in Alaska or Louisiana. As a region, the entire Gulf Coast is showing the strongest gains.
The decline of New England ports "shouldn't surprise anyone, with groundfish taken almost totally from the picture," said Robert Lewis of the Maine Department of Marine Resources. "Along with lobster, cod, haddock and flounder have been the backbone of the business, and they're just plain gone. Portland had a nice surge in '93," he said Thursday. "With good prices at their auctions, fishermen were willing to go a little out of their way. But you can't sell what you don't have, so it's dropped back to where it was before. Thank God for lobster."
Lewis noted that Maine would show up stronger on the national list if lobstermen weren't so famously independent.
"In most states, you have a few major ports where everything comes in," he said. "In Maine, we have dozens of small towns with buyers on every dock -- Port Clyde, Spruce Head, Vinalhaven, Friendship -- and lobstermen like to deal with people they know. If you put $100 million worth of lobster into one port, say Rockland or Portland, they'd shoot way up."
The National Marine Fisheries Service also reports that Americans ate more seafood in 1994 than the year before, 3.93 billion pounds total, or 15.2 pounds per person. That is an increase from 1993 of 76 million pounds, or nearly a quarter-pound per person.
Of that 15.2 pounds, two-thirds was fresh or frozen fish and shellfish. Most of the rest was canned, with cured seafood, such as smoked fish, accounting for the few remaining ounces. Shrimp is the strongest growth area in seafood, with the 2.6 pounds per capita consumed in 1994, a record.
After languishing in the 11- to 12-pound range for nearly a century, the United States upped its per-capita seafood intake in the early 1980s and has consumed at least 15 pounds per person every year since 1985. The record of 16.2 pounds was set in 1987.
Fifty-four percent of the seafood eaten in this country last year was imported, while U.S. exports declined by 1 percent for the second year in a row.

Abstract: Federal grants totaling $4.5 million, including more than a half-million dollars for Maine, have been awarded to 35 projects designed to help struggling fishermen in the Northeast move into new business ventures ranging from recycling sea cucumber waste and lobster bodies to cranberry farming. Of the $4.5 million, nearly half will go to aquaculture-related projects, a quarter to new business development, a fifth to developing markets for underused species, and the remainder to reduce "bycatch," the unintended harvest of juvenile fish and untargeted species. The Fishing Industry Grant Program is administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Marine Fisheries Service. The grants are part of a $30 million package that also includes boat buyback and retraining programs to help New England fishermen shift their effort from the overfished groundfish species of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder.

Of the $4.5 million, nearly half will go to aquaculture-related projects, a quarter to new business development, a fifth to developing markets for underused species, and the remainder to reduce "bycatch," the unintended harvest of juvenile fish and untargeted species.
The Fishing Industry Grant Program is administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Marine Fisheries Service. The grants are part of a $30 million package that also includes boat buyback and retraining programs to help New England fishermen shift their effort from the overfished groundfish species of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder.
This is the second round of Fishing Industry Grants. The first, announced last winter, awarded $4.5 million to 28 projects, with aquaculture leading the way.
The second-round grants still must be approved by the Commerce Department, with the money expected to be available Nov. 1. Of the $4.5 million total, $2.1 million will go to Massachusetts projects, $688,000 to Maine, $607,000 to New York and $420,000 to New Hampshire, with smaller amounts to New Jersey, Rhode Island and Maryland.
The sole aquaculture project awarded to Maine is $65,700 to Mook Sea Farms of Damariscotta to develop production strategies for the farming of sea scallops.
Most of the awards to Maine are for the development of new business ventures:
$39,129 to Carver Shellfish Inc. of Beals Island to develop a paste from waste lobster bodies to be used as a base for soups, stuffing, dips and salad dressings, and to develop new uses for the shell and body.
$36,700 to Dean Bradshaw of Dennysville to help 12 fishermen start cranberry businesses.
$42,986 to the Sunrise County Economic Council of Machias to develop markets for sea cucumber waste such as dried additive for salmon feed.
$221,028 to the Maine Department of Marine Resources to test the feasibility of using commercial fishing vessels to conduct acoustic surveys of herring spawning stocks in the Gulf of Maine.
In the category of develping underused species, Stephen Geel of Jonesport was awarded $82,150 to develop a dehumidification process for sea cucumbers. In bycatch reduction, Ronnie Shepard of Stonington will receive $43,413 to evaluate a shrimp grate to reduce the harvest of juvenile shrimp and groundfish. Also, the state DMR will receive $160,604 to reduce bycatch in the whiting fishery through gear modification.
The largest grant is $458,378 to Mariculture Techologies Inc. of Greenport, N.Y., to develop commercial-scale aquaculture systems for summer flounder and to assess the potential for flounder farming in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.
Maine projects funded in the first round last year included developing a snow crab fishery, value-added products from sculpin tails, seaweed aquaculture, cod and haddock aquaculture and uses for shellfish waste.
Since then, the prognosis for groundfish stocks has grown more bleak, leading the National Marine Fisheries Service to enact an emergency closure of Georges Bank and to begin preparing more stringent fishing regulations.
"The crisis is continuing and worsening, and the measures that will be taken to address it will be more severe," Scott Tilton of the service's Family Fishing Assistance Center in Rockland said Wednesday. "That makes programs like these grants, the buyout, the retraining, more necessary than ever."
Some of the selections in the first round of grants, such as the seaweed project, were criticized for not being directly related to fishing, and Tilton expects more complaints this time around.
"I know some fishermen will ask why this is funding cranberries," he said. "It's for the same reason we have fishermen retraining to become diesel mechanics and medical technicians. We have to reduce, drastically, the pressure on groundfish and help fishermen support themselves and their families. If it's in aquaculture or an alternative species, fine, but some may have to start looking at other employment opportunities, even if they're outside of fishing."

Abstract: The Dexter Utility District is applying for funding from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection's Small Community Grant Program to upgrade or replace the septic systems of property owners along Lake Wassookeag. The recent application comes on the heels of a successful award which the community received to upgrade septic systems on properties surrounding Echo Lake. Three property owners received funds for up to 90 percent of the total cost to replace or fix their failing septic systems. Additional funds are now being sought for other qualifying property owners. The goal for the Lake Wassookeag project is the same as that at Echo Lake: to identify septic sources which are contaminating the lake and secure state funds to assist the owners in repairing or replacing the systems.

Full text: DEXTER -- The Dexter Utility District is applying for funding from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection's Small Community Grant Program to upgrade or replace the septic systems of property owners along Lake Wassookeag.
The state grant program could provide up to 90 percent funding for sewage treatment and disposal systems to eliminate waste-water discharges which affect drinking water supplies, pollute shellfishing areas, degrade water quality, or cause a public nuisance. The program is intended to provide facilities in rural areas of the state not served by public sewers.
The recent application comes on the heels of a successful award which the community received to upgrade septic systems on properties surrounding Echo Lake. Three property owners received funds for up to 90 percent of the total cost to replace or fix their failing septic systems. Additional funds are now being sought for other qualifying property owners. The goal for the Lake Wassookeag project is the same as that at Echo Lake: to identify septic sources which are contaminating the lake and secure state funds to assist the owners in repairing or replacing the systems.
According to John Simko, Dexter Community Development Director, chances are good for the utility district to be awarded this grant, which could be for as much as $100,000.
"The DEP's Small Community Grant Program is designed to improve water quality across the state, and has earmarked their project funds into three categories. The town's Echo Lake project was awarded a grant, although for a diminished amount, mostly because it fell into the least-pressing category of water quality programs. Lake Wassookeag, as the singular freshwater supply for the entire public water system, is given the highest priority classification by the DEP. We're quite hopeful the project will be funded."
Better to ensure the grant's success, the utility district is seeking to define the needs of property owners along Lake Wassookeag. A survey will be sent to all property owners within the Lake Wassookeag watershed to explain the grant project and to request basic information regarding the type and current functioning of their septic systems. The letter will be mailed out today.
"The Dexter Utility District is asking for cooperation in the filing and return of these surveys from the land owners. The clearer the scope of the problem, the more likely Dexter will be awarded the grant. If we're not aware of the water quality problem, we can't fix it," Simko said.
If the grant is successful, year-round residents of Lake Wassookeag will be eligible for up to 90 percent of the repair of their systems. Businesses will have up to 50 percent of their costs covered and seasonal owners will be eligible for up to 25 percent of the total costs of the repairs.
"If the survey can be completed by this fall and the application completed before winter, funding for this project could be available as early as May of 1996," Simko said.

Abstract: ESSEX, Mass. -- Local clam diggers and Hollywood filmmakers are at odds in a dispute pitting the 20th century against the 17th century. Clam diggers say Twentieth Century Fox officials don't want them or their motor boats within camera range on clam flats when filming panoramic views for the movie version of Arthur Miller's play "The Crucible." The play is about the Salem witch trials, and the film company is creating a replica of 1692 Salem on a slope of Hog island, which overlooks one of the area's richest clam beds.

Full text:   ESSEX, Mass. -- Local clam diggers and Hollywood filmmakers are at odds in a dispute pitting the 20th century against the 17th century.
Clam diggers say Twentieth Century Fox officials don't want them or their motor boats within camera range on clam flats when filming panoramic views for the movie version of Arthur Miller's play "The Crucible."
The play is about the Salem witch trials, and the film company is creating a replica of 1692 Salem on a slope of Hog island, which overlooks one of the area's richest clam beds.
"These guys are out there to make money, and they want to tell guys like me to go somewhere else, to take money out of our pockets. That's not fair," Ross Parody, 37, a clam digger, told the Boston Herald.
Because of the protests from local shellfishers, selectmen will hold a special meeting Monday to ask Twentieth Century Fox officials about their plans.
Ed Neal, chairman of the selectmen, said film company officials assured him they don't want to inconvenience anyone.
"But they don't want to see little clam boats bobbing up and down in their shots and guys bending over in their Wrangler jeans," he said.
Film company officials declined to comment to the Herald Thursday. Company location manager Charles Harrington said he will do his talking at the meeting Monday.
Filming of the multi-million-dollar movie is to begin Sept. 11. It will star Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder.
Neal, who said film company officials told him there will be a minimum of panoramic shots, said the film's economic boost to the area would appear to outweigh minor inconveniences to clam diggers and boaters.
"I really don't think it's a big issue," he said, adding that the town has the legal right to close the clam beds if deemed necessary.
Some of about a dozen clam diggers working Cleveland Flat at low tide Thursday told the Herald they support their families that way.
"I don't think they have the right to tell us to move and not be willing to compensate us in some way," said Bill Appeltofft, 33.
The clam-digging season is peaking, he said, and it would be horrible if he had to stop working Cleveland Flat. He said he would be willing to dig somewhere else if the film company paid him $100 a day.
However another clam digger, Richard Tofuri, 20, had a softer view.
"If I can make the same day's pay on the other side of the river, I don't see what the big deal is," he said.
"I think it's great they picked Salem to film. It's a beautiful place."

Abstract: Coastal Waters Project's plan to restore scallops to upper Penobscot Bay was dealt a setback when the Board of Environmental Protection decided the Defense Department was not obligated to test the waters for petroleum contamination. Nevertheless, [Ron] Huber said his group hoped to convince Sprague Energy and Irving Oil, two private firms with storage facilities at the point, to take part in a public-private testing program. He said Lt. Col. Charles Renfro, commander of Defense Fuel Region Northeast, had agreed to contribute to the joint testing project. Renfro was traveling Thursday and could not be reached for comment. Huber said his group applauds the Defense Department for its offer to take part in the testing project. He added that Sprague Energy has also indicated an interest in participating in such a study. "We're waiting to hear from Irving Oil. Hopefully, we can soon find out if oil pollution is a significant reason for the decline of upper Penobscot Bay's once abundant shellfish."

Full text:   AUGUSTA -- Coastal Waters Project's plan to restore scallops to upper Penobscot Bay was dealt a setback when the Board of Environmental Protection decided the Defense Department was not obligated to test the waters for petroleum contamination.
The Pentagon operates a jet fuel tank farm at Mack Point on Long Cove, across from Sears Island. Coastal Waters had attempted to block the re-licensing of that facility until offshore testing was undertaken. The board rejected the appeal 3-2 Wednesday.
"We're disappointed by the board's ruling," CWP's Ron Huber said Thursday. "In effect, the board said that restoring upper Penobscot Bay's shellfish industry is not a high priority for the state."
Nevertheless, Huber said his group hoped to convince Sprague Energy and Irving Oil, two private firms with storage facilities at the point, to take part in a public-private testing program. He said Lt. Col. Charles Renfro, commander of Defense Fuel Region Northeast, had agreed to contribute to the joint testing project. Renfro was traveling Thursday and could not be reached for comment.
Huber said his group applauds the Defense Department for its offer to take part in the testing project. He added that Sprague Energy has also indicated an interest in participating in such a study. "We're waiting to hear from Irving Oil. Hopefully, we can soon find out if oil pollution is a significant reason for the decline of upper Penobscot Bay's once abundant shellfish."
Huber said the BEP was reluctant to order extensive testing because there was no conclusive evidence of major oil spills since the early 1970s. He said the Defense Department will conduct some testing in and near the drainage ditches and culverts that surround the terminals as part of the license renewal.
"There was some circumstantial evidence, but no proof of spills. We didn't have the resources to pull up a handful of muck and say, `look at this,"' he said.
Huber said his group has been working with Charles Stevens of Clams Fiesta in Rockland and local fishermen on a plan to restore the upper Penobscot Bay's shellfishery by re-introducing scallops and other shellfish from the outer bay to nutrient-rich Long Cove in Searsport.
"Placed in protected areas, these scallops will serve as spawning stocks whose larvae could recolonize dozens of square miles of the upper bay's sea floor," Huber said.
He noted that, unlike clams, the part of the scallop consumed by humans is not affected by coliform bacterial pollution. That distinction allows scallop fishing in many of the same areas that are closed to clamming.
"Before we can do anything," Huber said, "we need to know if there is significant oil pollution in Long Cove, as it could prove deadly to scallops and their larvae."
Huber said the "limited testing" of areas around the tank terminals should be completed by October. "At that point -- presuming it's not sweet and clean -- we will make the next move: to ask them to come up with a more comprehensive study."

Abstract: At the end of a muggy Sunday afternoon, they straggled into the Lamoine Town Hall hauling saxophones, flutes, tubas, trombones, trumpets and clarinets. Lamoine is throwing open its doors for a birthday bash this weekend, bringing together its present-day residents for a parade, street dance, games and community art show, and inviting others in for a look at what this Down East Maine town used to be and what it is today. By the 1800s, the miles of coastline provided a year-round way of life, with shipbuilding a major industry. Over 60 vessels were built in Lamoine -- many two-masted schooners -- and most of those before the Civil War when Lamoine was known as East Trenton.

From age 7 to 47 and beyond, this ragtag band -- in shorts and flipflops, overalls and T-shirts -- had been pulled from sandy beaches and backyard barbecues to prepare for Lamoine's 125th birthday celebration.
Tuning up for this one-of-a-kind performance, band leader Jim Trembley enthusiastically coaxed an E sharp from the flutes and overlooked a discordant measure or two from his motley crew as they belted out the "Charleston" and "Rubber Ducky."
This band is Lamoine's present and future, ready to celebrate with music a community that once had and still claims vital ties to the sea.
Lamoine is throwing open its doors for a birthday bash this weekend, bringing together its present-day residents for a parade, street dance, games and community art show, and inviting others in for a look at what this Down East Maine town used to be and what it is today.
Locate Lamoine on any state map or fly over it for an aerial view and you can make good guesses about its past and present.
It is a town bordered on nearly every side by the ocean, and the trades of the sea sustained its earliest residents. Archaeologists have found that Native Americans first came to its shores, reaping the abundance of shellfish and marine mammals along the coastline during the winter months.
By the 1800s, the miles of coastline provided a year-round way of life, with shipbuilding a major industry. Over 60 vessels were built in Lamoine -- many two-masted schooners -- and most of those before the Civil War when Lamoine was known as East Trenton.
Its sea captains traveled the world, sailing their schooners to the Caribbean, South America and China.
If not engaged in shipbuilding, residents turned to farming, fishing, logging, blacksmithing, carpentry and running general stores.
The fishermen of the 1800s traveled to Nova Scotia and the Grand Banks for extended excursions, when cod and herring were the fish of choice. The fish were brought back to Lamoine to one of many wharves and smokehouses along the Jordan River, where the catch was dried and shipped off to Boston.
Roads were superfluous in early Lamoine. The highway was the sea.
By 1870, the town had incorporated, a fact made official by Gov. Joshua Chamberlain who signed the bill into law. The town was named after an early resident, Andre LeMoyne, who was one of an earlier group of French people who had hoped to establish a safe haven at Lamoine Beach for aristocrats escaping the French Revolution.
A bustling town in the late 1800s, Lamoine shipped ice to Boston from Blunt's Pond, canned sardines at the cannery at the local beach, and welcomed guests at in-town hotels -- Shore Acres at Lamoine Beach and the Gault Hotel at the present state park.
Steamboat service to and from Bar Harbor across Eastern Bay brought visitors to its shores, and sightseeing trips aboard schooners were ready for tourists who traveled to Lamoine in the late 1800s.
With a dwindling economy and a loss of jobs in the shipbuilding and shipping businesses, Lamoine's population began to decline after the heydays of the 1880s, reaching a low point during the 1930s and 1940s.
Today fewer than 50 boats, many of those pleasure craft, moor off Lamoine State Park. The pockmarks in the town's interior landscape are the gravel pits, now the major industry. As a bedroom community with no general store, post office, hotels or fish wharves, the town turns to the sea for pleasure, its seaside real estate a major resource.
This weekend several activities will mark the anniversary. On Friday, tours of seven of Lamoine's oldest houses and two of its churches will be conducted from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tickets may be purchased at the Town Hall. Cassettes and a detailed map describing historic places included within a self-guided tour of Lamoine are available at the Town Hall or at the information booth at Coyne Field, both on Route 184.
The parade begins at 11 a.m. Saturday at the Lamoine Grange, with old-fashioned games after the parade at Coyne Field. A daylong yard sale will be staged from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Grange Hall. Following a Grange supper at 5:30 p.m., silent movies with a piano accompaniment will begin at 7 p.m.
On Sunday, a craft fair will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Lamoine School, and a community art show and exhibit of Lamoine's history will be on display at the state park throughout the day. Admission to the park that day is free.
The community concert, with band and chorus, begins on Sunday at 2 p.m. at the state park, where several boats will be available for touring. Family sports activities will be ongoing Sunday afternoon at the park.

Abstract: Humor, hard work and having a closeknit family may be some of the key elements that keep Gladys Smith going at the age of 100, but her beloved 1983 Buick Electra does for sure as she continues to drive herself on errands around West Jonesport. But she doesn't venture too far, as she did at age 88, when she traveled to France to stay with her granddaughter and family who were living in the Alsatian town of Soultz. She fears she'll get exhausted and won't be able to get back home. A tall, handsome woman with a heart-shaped face, Gladys Smith looked radiant as she was escorted into the Jonesport-Beals High School gym where she was honored by relatives, friends and neighbors at a big birthday bash Tuesday afternoon. She wore a brooch, a favorite blue floral print dress and a dainty crocheted cardigan for the occasion.

Full text:   Humor, hard work and having a closeknit family may be some of the key elements that keep Gladys Smith going at the age of 100, but her beloved 1983 Buick Electra does for sure as she continues to drive herself on errands around West Jonesport.
"I go to the cemetery, Fleet Bank, library and IGA grocery store," said the centenarian who has logged 40,105 miles since her copper and beige Buick was purchased in 1983.
But she doesn't venture too far, as she did at age 88, when she traveled to France to stay with her granddaughter and family who were living in the Alsatian town of Soultz. She fears she'll get exhausted and won't be able to get back home.
A tall, handsome woman with a heart-shaped face, Gladys Smith looked radiant as she was escorted into the Jonesport-Beals High School gym where she was honored by relatives, friends and neighbors at a big birthday bash Tuesday afternoon. She wore a brooch, a favorite blue floral print dress and a dainty crocheted cardigan for the occasion.
An easychair for the guest of honor was positioned in the middle of the gym. A string of letters spelling out "Happy 100th Birthday" hung from a long table laden with lobster rolls, crabmeat sandwiches and other refreshments. A triple-tiered white cake decked with lavender flowers formed the centerpiece on another table.
Before the reception, Smith reminisced about her long life in her pea-green house that sits on a knoll above a duck pond ringed with cat-o-nine tails. From her porch, she can see her three sons' wharf and lobster business, Smith Brothers, beside Abram's Cove and Moosabec Reach beyond.
Smith comes from a long line of seafaring folk. Her father originally came from Maryland where he fished for oysters in Chesapeake Bay. He switched to buying and fishing for lobsters after settling in Maine.
She spent part of her childhood on a saltwater farm in nearby South Addison. "My mind is just as good as it ever was. I could sit down and draw a picture of that farm," Smith mused.
Seated in an easychair in her living room, Smith pointed out an oil painting of a white-hulled schooner hanging on the wall. She said the Margaret Roper was one of five coastal schooners belonging to her late husband's grandfather.
Smith and her husband, Leon Smith Sr., had three sons and two daughters, their first girl dying at the age of ten. She remembers she kept as many as three cows and several hundred chickens to help feed the family.
"Land sakes, I did all the milking," she laughed, a broad smile breaking across her lined face.
After their children had grown up, it became an annual ritual for the Smiths to go to Florida from January until May 1, their wedding anniversary. A glass-doored cabinet brims with coral, conch and other seashells that are reminders of those happy days.
In her lifetime, Smith has witnessed many dramatic changes around town. She remembers the day when there was no electricity or sidewalks. She marvels at how Maine's fisheries have changed. She is amused at the demand for sea urchins, sea cucumbers and other marine creatures she would never dream of eating.
Slightly hard of hearing, Smith has few physical complaints save for her legs that sometimes "smart and burn." Her doctor says her circulation is fine and can't seem to find the origin of the discomfort.
"To tell the truth, I have an idea he thinks it's old age because he doesn't say anything," she chuckled.
Keeping busy seems key to Smith's longevity. She does much of her own cooking. She continues to read and crochet. She keeps in line her lively golden retriever, Goldie, that is a fraction of her age.
Brightly-colored crocheted afghans and pillows adorning practically every sofa and chair are evidence of her fine handiwork.
Smith has been crocheting a present for her grandson but won't reveal what it is.
"He tells me, `Nana, when you get that done, I want you to drive down so I can tell people my 100-year-old grandmother delivered it.' "

Yarmouth mulls wider clamming Commercial digging may resume

Abstract: The Yarmouth Clam Festival could, within a few years, be offering home-grown clams. The coastal town, which draws thousands of visitors to the annual midsummer festival that celebrates the clam, has been off-limits to commercial clam digging for nearly a decade. As a result, the mountains of clams served at the festival come from outside the town. Backed by some members of Yarmouth's Shellfish Commission and commercial diggers, the town is taking steps to revitalize commercial clam harvesting, a move some say will boost the local economy and help clean Casco Bay.

Full text: YARMOUTH -- The Yarmouth Clam Festival could, within a few years, be offering home-grown clams.
The coastal town, which draws thousands of visitors to the annual midsummer festival that celebrates the clam, has been off-limits to commercial clam digging for nearly a decade. As a result, the mountains of clams served at the festival come from outside the town.
Backed by some members of Yarmouth's Shellfish Commission and commercial diggers, the town is taking steps to revitalize commercial clam harvesting, a move some say will boost the local economy and help clean Casco Bay.
The driving force behind the effort is Jay Pinkham, a recent addition to the commission. He points to the thriving clamming industry in Freeport, saying commercial clamming there employs 62 diggers and pumps about $1 million into the local economy.
If the clam population rebounds in Yarmouth, Pinkham and other commission members say, commercial diggers could be working the mud flats in two or three years.
More than one-third of Casco Bay's flats are closed to digging because of pollution. In Yarmouth, much of the shoreline on the town's islands are open for digging, but expansive flats on the mainland are closed because of pollution.
Pinkham has started work with biologists from the Maine Department of Marine Resources to study the Yarmouth shoreline for sources of pollution, such as outhouses and faulty septic systems and tanks.
A biologist's survey of the flats last fall showed that while the number of mature clams remains low, the number of seed clams is much higher than it has been in years. Small seed clams, which are from a quarter to a half-inch long, take about three years before they are large enough to harvest.
"I think Yarmouth is on the right track," said Ted Curtis, the commission chairman and shellfish warden in neighboring Cumberland. "If we still have abundant seed and keep up the fight to locate areas of potential contamination, we could maybe support some commercial digging."
The commission has refused to offer commercial licenses because the short supply of clams would not support an intensive harvest, Curtis said.
This year, as it has in the past, Yarmouth decided to sell only "mess licenses," geared toward recreational diggers who can harvest up to a peck of clams a day, usually enough for supper.
Ardley Cusack, Yarmouth's shellfish warden, said that with so much of Yarmouth's mainland closed to digging, issuing commercial licenses would cause an uproar.
"If you put commercial diggers on the islands, you can forget your recreational diggers, because there won't be any clams left," he said.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Julie Lynn Hedrich of Rockland was crowned Maine Sea Goddess at the 48th annual Maine Lobster Festival Friday night.
The runner-up crown princess is Sharon Diane Barrows, also of Rockland. Both women are 1995 graduates of Rockland District High School.
Hedrich, 18, is the daughter of David and Charlene Hedrich. She plans to attend the University of Maine to major in premedicine and microbiology. Her RDHS activities included Girls State, National Honor Society, theater, sports, jazz band, math team and student government. Her festival sponsors were Andrus Flowers and Gifts and the accounting firm of Simoneau and Norton.
Barrows, 18, is the daughter of Jeff and Lillian Barrows. She plans to attend Baker College, studying for a career as a social worker. At RDHS, she was active in sports, cheerleading, the community service group, peer helpers and Project Graduation. Her sponsors were Bruce Gamage Jr. Antiques and Shepard Motors.
The Sea Goddess Pageant was held at the Fishermen's Memorial Stage with 19 contestants vying for the crown, judged on their accomplishments and performance in interviews testing their knowledge of both current events and the state's premier crustacean. As Sea Goddess, Hedrich will represent the Maine lobster industry at events and trade shows during the coming year.
An unappetizing drizzle didn't keep a huge crowd from packing the fairgrounds to the gills Friday. Despite, or perhaps because of, a full-page ad in a local paper Thursday by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and actress Mary Tyler Moore protesting the boiling of live lobsters, festival organizers predict shellfish sales in excess of 15,000 pounds this year, a good ton and a half beyond last year's record.
The first official duty for Hedrich and Barrows will be to preside over today's Harbor of Delights Parade down Rockland's Main Street at 10 a.m. Other Saturday events include tours of the Navy ship USS Stephen W. Groves, a blindfold rowboat race, a parade of lobster boats and an 8:30 p.m. performance by Motown legends Martha Reeves and the Vandellas.
The festival wraps up Sunday with a 10K road race, the codfish carry and the lobster crate race, with King Neptune returning to the briny deep at 5 p.m. until next year.

Full text: STEUBEN -- Residents will mark their town's 200th birthday by staging a full day of family entertainment commencing with a craft fair and culminating with a fireworks display Saturday night.
Incorporated on Feb. 27, 1795, Steuben has grown from several hundred to 1,100 year-round residents. Traditions die hard in this town, where residents throughout the year have been re-creating their past in honor of the bicentennial. Earlier this year, they re-enacted the first town meeting, and this fall they plan to throw a grand ball and midnight oyster stew supper similar to one held a century ago.
"I'd say the town doesn't like to see new changes," summed up Steuben's first selectman, Handy Pinkham. He has served on the board for more than three decades.
Steuben bicentennial committee members raised $5,000 for the fireworks show from the town meeting re-enactment and accompanying chicken pot pie supper, lobster stew and strawberry shortcake dinner, gospel concert, and numerous other fund-raisers. Additional funds raised will be used for the restoration of old town records.
Dyers Bay resident Barbara Jason is assembling a bicentennial quilt. The squares were sewn by more than two dozen women in town.
Saturday's bicentennial festivities kick off at 10 a.m. at the Ella Lewis School with a craft fair, pony rides, children's games, a horseshoe pitching tournament, a gospel music concert and antique car show. Trophies for five classes of antique cars will be presented at 1:30 p.m.
At noon, the Steuben Fire Department will hold a chicken barbecue, with potato salad, corn on the cob and blueberry pie. Acadia bagpipers and drummers will perform afterward.
The country-rock group Ambush will provide music 3 to 4 p.m. Crab rolls and other refreshments will be on sale.
At 6:30 p.m., Steuben resident Mary Alice Thurston and family, folk singer Ruby Gensheimer, pianist-composer Glenn Collind and balladeer Ron Williams will be among the local talent performing in a variety show in the grammar school gym.
The fireworks display will follow at 9 p.m. at the firehouse field off Route 1.

Maine's freshwater mussels abound

Abstract: Freshwater mussels look like clams, but they are not one of the state's seafood delicacies. Of the 297 species of freshwater mussels in North America, only 11 species can be been found in Maine, said [Mark A.] McCollough. Some species, like the Eastern Elliptio, are common here, but others, like the Tidewater Mucket, are rare. The Tidewater Mucket can only be found in two or three sites; one site is the Chickawaukee River in Rockland. The Eastern Elliptio can be seen in nearly all lakes, ponds and rivers in Maine. It has brown to coppery-brown shells. The Yellow Lampmussel has yellowish colored shells and can be found in 15 of the state's watersheds, such as the St. George River, the Penobscot River, the Mattawamkeag River and the Sheepscot River.

Full text: Freshwater mussels look like clams, but they are not one of the state's seafood delicacies.
Craving the taste of steamed clams, a group of Scouts recently gathered up a bunch of freshwater mussels and cooked them.
"They taste like an old piece of leather that was on the bottom of a stream for 10 years," said Mark A. McCollough, a wildlife biologist with the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, who was with the youngsters.
Of the 297 species of freshwater mussels in North America, only 11 species can be been found in Maine, said McCollough. Some species, like the Eastern Elliptio, are common here, but others, like the Tidewater Mucket, are rare. The Tidewater Mucket can only be found in two or three sites; one site is the Chickawaukee River in Rockland.
The Eastern Elliptio can be seen in nearly all lakes, ponds and rivers in Maine. It has brown to coppery-brown shells. The Yellow Lampmussel has yellowish colored shells and can be found in 15 of the state's watersheds, such as the St. George River, the Penobscot River, the Mattawamkeag River and the Sheepscot River.
Freshwater mussels have very complex anatomies, said McCollough. Muscles hold the two halves of the shell together. Inside the mollusk, there is a digestive system, a reproductive system and gills to breath.
Freshwater mussels purify water. All day long they filter water. They sieve out the phytoplankton and bacteria.
"An individual mussel in the course of 24 hours may filter hundreds of gallons of water," said the biologist. "They are constantly cleaning the water."
Mussels can move, but generally don't go more than a few yards from where they settle in the bottom of a stream, lake or pond. Some mussels, like the Eastern Pearl, may live for more than 100 years, much longer than the Eastern Elliptio, which lives eight to 10 years. Counting the dark rings on the shells will tell you the mussel's age.
One interesting thing about mussels is they cannot survive without an appropriate host fish to carry their young, McCollough said. Young mussels, called glochidia, are almost microscopic. They look like a tiny clam with little sharp projections. When they are released into the water, they float for a few days trying to find a fish to grab onto.
"It can't be any fish," said McCollough. "Each species of mussels has only one or two host fish. We don't even know at this time what host fish is necessary to keep these populations of mussels alive."
The glochidia latch onto the gills or the fins of a fish while undergoing a complete transformation into miniature adult mussels. After a few weeks, they drop off the fish and land on the bottom of the lake or stream.
Therefore, McCollough said, to maintain the mussel's existence it is not only important to maintain water quality, but also to maintain the fish species there.

Abstract: A recent letter attributed the reason for God's destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah to the gay lifestyle. Therefore gays are not acceptable to God. While this is an opinion held by some, it is not what current biblical scholarship has found. Nor what Jesus Christ seems to imply in Matthew's Gospel (Chapter 10, verses 11-15) about why these cities were destroyed. Jesus' statement compares a town's inhospitality for his gospel message with Sodom and Gomorrah's final fate. "I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town." What is Jesus comparing? Is it sexual sin vs. hospitality? I don't think so.

Full text: A recent letter attributed the reason for God's destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah to the gay lifestyle. Therefore gays are not acceptable to God. While this is an opinion held by some, it is not what current biblical scholarship has found. Nor what Jesus Christ seems to imply in Matthew's Gospel (Chapter 10, verses 11-15) about why these cities were destroyed. Jesus' statement compares a town's inhospitality for his gospel message with Sodom and Gomorrah's final fate. "I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town." What is Jesus comparing? Is it sexual sin vs. hospitality? I don't think so.
The misunderstanding that the sin of Sodom was sexual and in particular homosexual sex goes back to the story found in the book of Genesis. In this account, the people of Sodom wanted to "know" the messenger of God (an angel) at Lot's home. In the King James Bible, to "know" was commonly used for sexual knowledge as in "Adam knew Eve and begot Cain and Abel." The original Hebrew for the verb "to know" in the Sodom story is not the same word as used for sexual knowledge in other parts of the book of Genesis. Biblical research has known this since the 1950's, when books were published on the original language of this text.
In the English language today, because of this misunderstanding based on the King James Bible, we have the term "sodomy."
Many people use the text in Leviticus to condemn gays. This is the same book of the Bible that prohibits eating shellfish.
I can understand how many still cling to this viewpoint of ignorance. But several Christian denominations recognize the past injustice and today accept gays openly in their churches and even into their ministries, such as the Episcopalians and the United Church of Christ.
I do not wish to sound like I am mocking the holy scriptures. As a Christian, I follow Jesus and try to understand the Bible through his message of love and acceptance. I read scripture daily seeking to understand the texts through what Jesus taught.
When I read letters to the editor using the Christian faith against gays, I must speak out. God loves his creation. All of us! Thomas G. Stama Milbridge

Spudstock draws few fans, cool reviews Concert-goers disappointed by rain delays, cancellation of Blue Oyster Cult

Full text:   FORT FAIRFIELD -- Their eyes and ears absorbed more than 20 hours of live entertainment.
Their skin baked in the hot Fort Fairfield sun.
And now they have peeled out of here in search of a new adventure.
They were the ticket-holders of Spudstock '95 and, after the three-day music festival, many of them departed Sunday feeling less than satisfied with the experience.
"I'm a little disappointed," was the phrase used by many of the concert-goers, Scott Woodard of Portland among them.
As he packed his hamburger grill into his white van Sunday morning, Woodard said he and his friend traveled about six hours to get to the event in Aroostook County that was billed as featuring 21 live musical performances playing to approximately 30,000 people.
When Woodard arrived on Friday he saw the stage still under construction, a far less than expected turnout that would eventually total only 6,300 for the three days, and a brief rain shower that delayed the start of the show for about two hours.
The rain delay stirred up the crowd and some felt the bands and crews were a little wet behind the ears already when it came to life in the County.
"We pick potatoes in worse weather than this," one angry fan yelled from the area in front of the stage.
Due to the inclement weather, Woodard and the rest of Friday's crowd saw a dramatic change in the performance schedule. One of the headlining bands, Blue Oyster Cult, did not play on Friday night as scheduled. Though it began to look doubtful as Saturday afternoon rolled around that the heavy metal group would play at all, some who were drawn to the festival partially because of the band's scheduled appearance refused to give up hope.
"No one knows if they're going to play," said Josh Bokesz, 15, of Somersworth, N.H., as he played Hackey Sack with two of his friends, all three paying little attention to the lesser-known band playing on the Spudstock stage at the time.
Blue Oyster Cult never did play during the three-day event, making it the only cancellation. This early disappointment did not make a good first impression with many ticket-holders and it did not lay groundwork for good relations between ticket-holders and organizers. But people gamely found ways to have a good time.
"I was expecting 30,000 people to be crammed into this tight space," said Chris Berube of St. Albans. "I am still having a great time," he quickly added, though, as he relaxed on the grass in front of the stage and listened to the music of The Boneheads.
Pam McGary of Patten expressed a similar sentiment as she enjoyed the final hours of Spudstock on Sunday. "I loved it. I'm sorry there wasn't more of a crowd," McGary said while awaiting the arrival of country star John Anderson.
Many made their best efforts to enjoy the festival by participating in games of volleyball, soccer, Frisbee disk toss and -- judging by a banner that read "Use Hemp Daily" and a young man who asked a vendor if he could buy "Spudstock condoms" -- less public forms of entertainment as well.
When it came to enjoying themselves in front of the stage area, however, some of those listening to the bands felt restricted by security guards who discouraged dancing. The approximately 75 guards, dressed in black T-shirts and carrying their walkie-talkies, tried to avoid any slam dancing incidents that would harm others watching the performances.
"Dancing is part of the music, man," a frustrated Richard Flannery of Portland said, commenting on the actions of the security guards.
Neil Collins of Twisted Roots, one of the more high-energy groups at Spudstock, had no qualms about telling guards to leave the audience alone as he played his bass guitar on stage.
"They're all mad at me for giving them a hard time over the microphone," Collins of Portland said as he signed autographs for several youngsters who raced up to the side of the stage with their magic markers and "Twisted Roots" posters.
Although security was seen as too tight by many, Ham Robbins of the Rent-A-Medic service, hired to provide care for the sick or injured, said there were few serious injuries.
"It's all been real light duty," Robbins said. The medic from Greenfield added that one of his main concerns was extreme temperatures. But with adequate water supplies, he added, this problem was avoided.
With a 48-foot trailer of the official "Spudstock Water" left over after the event, dehydration wasn't much of a problem -- that is, if you had the $2 to dish out for it.
Perhaps Quiet Riot should have kept their "Spudstock Water" instead of giving it away to some adoring fans. The heavy metal group's crew got in a skirmish with the Spudstock crew and they all could have used a little cooling off.
Lance Sullivan of Ashland summed up Spudstock '95 as he took a drag on a cigarette and watched the final activities on Sunday morning.
"It was so-so, it could have been better," Sullivan said.

Eddie Money, Quiet Riot fan favorites at Spudstock Concert-goers like rockers

Abstract: At the 103 acres of potato land that was the site for Spudstock '95, ticket-holders reaped less live music than they expected, but it was clear many still dug the performance of Eddie Money. Despite not starting his show until the wee hours of Sunday morning, when many in Aroostook County were fast asleep, Money came out swinging on the Fort Fairfield stage. Money wasted no time in delivering some of his crop of hits to the Spudstock audience and kicked his set off with one of his biggest singles, "Two Tickets to Paradise".

Full text: At the 103 acres of potato land that was the site for Spudstock '95, ticket-holders reaped less live music than they expected, but it was clear many still dug the performance of Eddie Money.
One of the lead bands, Blue Oyster Cult, failed to perform for the three-day concert. They showed up Friday night, but due to bad weather, they never took the stage.
Despite not starting his show until the wee hours of Sunday morning, when many in Aroostook County were fast asleep, Money came out swinging on the Fort Fairfield stage.
"I never go to bed before 3:30 anyway," the singer said, after whipping his microphone around in a circle by its cord.
Money wasted no time in delivering some of his crop of hits to the Spudstock audience and kicked his set off with one of his biggest singles, "Two Tickets to Paradise".
Despite a very lengthy soundcheck by members of his road crew, Money's first few numbers were plagued with distracting technical problems on the stage. These were soon taken care of, however, and fans could focus their attention on the tall, shaggy-haired rocker they had come to see.
Money thrilled the rambunctious crowd gathered on the farmland with hits from his heyday in the late 1970s and '80s, and he also introduced fans to songs from his latest album, "Love and Money."
"After This Love is Gone," a ballad and the first release from his latest effort, has the potential to put Money back on the charts. With songs like "Where's the Party?" and "Shakin"' in his arsenal, however, fans wanted Money to make them dance, and he certainly didn't disappoint during his 1 1/2-hour performance.
In the crowd-pleasing department, Quiet Riot and The Guess Who were the only two acts that really gave Eddie a run for his money during the three-day music festival.
Quiet Riot, a successful heavy-metal group during the mid-'80s that has recently resurfaced with a new album, is not on tour, but traveled 3,500 miles to perform at Spudstock.
"I didn't travel 3,500 miles not to give you everything I've got," lead singer Kevin Dubrow said. "We're here to play an evening of politically incorrect rock 'n' roll for you, and that's the way it should be." Dubrow then went on to give his tender acoustic delivery of "Love's a Bitch."
Quiet Riot sounded much like the group of old on all of its material, and guitarist Carlos Cavazo gave an impresssive solo of at least three minutes in length, but it was the band's familiar songs, such as "Cum On Feel The Noize" and "Metal Health (Bang Your Head)," that struck the right chords with the Spudstock audience. It will be difficult for Quiet Riot's new work to silence some of the frenzy surrounding today's hard-hitters, such as Pearl Jam and Soundgarden.
Faced with the job of carrying the Spudstock concert between Quiet Riot's near-deafening show and Eddie Money's rockin' performance, The Guess Who's often mellow tunes wound up sounding a little like elevator music. Although the group's harmonies and often boyish stage antics were entertaining throughout the set, it seemed that many in the crowd were eager to hear The Guess Who's popular 1970s hit, "American Woman," which the quintet performed near the end of the show.
Most of the other rock 'n' roll acts drew sparse crowds to the stage-front area at Spudstock, but the event did give these lesser-known local bands, such as the high-energy, Portland-based Twisted Roots, the opportunity to increase their followings.
On Sunday, the final day of Spudstock, it was country roads that took the concert-goers home, and it was country music that set them on their way. Country acts Silver & Lace, Doug Kershaw and John Anderson added a little twang to the festivities.
Anderson, who was the biggest name in the 20 acts that appeared at Spudstock, belted out hits from his 1993 gold album, "Solid Ground," and his 1992 platinum work, "Seminole Wind," in front of the dwindling number of ticket-holders at the site on Sunday afternoon.
The singer performed with few fireworks and gave a straightforward delivery of his hits. After singing such songs as the jukebox favorite, "Swingin"' and the ballad "I Wish I Could Have Been There," Anderson said goodbye from beneath his black, 10-gallon hat to his laid-back and appreciative audience.

Abstract: A total of 32 hours of rock music played by 20 groups will reverberate from a hillside amphitheater at the Spudstock festival here July 21-23. "We are pretty psyched," said Jay McKenney of Fort Fairfield, the group's spokesman. McKenney, 31, and an elementary school teacher, plays the drums and sings. His brother, Matt McKenney, 32, plays the guitar, sings, and with the exception of one set of lyrics written by Jay, wrote all the music and words in the four or five songs described as "quite heavy rock." Ben Findlen, 18, a high school senior in Fort Fairfield plays bass guitar. John McNally, 27, of Westfield, plays rhythm guitar. "We want to salute Fort Fairfield," Bob Johnston, president of Spudstock Entertainment Inc., explained in his choice of the show opener. Johnston and his partner, Jim Ossie, are both Fort Fairfield natives who say the festival was planned as an economic boost to the town. They expect 30,000 people to show up.

Full text: FORT FAIRFIELD -- A total of 32 hours of rock music played by 20 groups will reverberate from a hillside amphitheater at the Spudstock festival here July 21-23.
A local group, Headcleaner, was chosen to open the festival at 4 p.m. on Friday.
"We are pretty psyched," said Jay McKenney of Fort Fairfield, the group's spokesman. McKenney, 31, and an elementary school teacher, plays the drums and sings. His brother, Matt McKenney, 32, plays the guitar, sings, and with the exception of one set of lyrics written by Jay, wrote all the music and words in the four or five songs described as "quite heavy rock." Ben Findlen, 18, a high school senior in Fort Fairfield plays bass guitar. John McNally, 27, of Westfield, plays rhythm guitar.
"If anything is going to go wrong with the sound, it will happen in the opening act," said Jay McKenney, delighted to lead the bands through the event being billed as the largest outdoor music festival in the history of the state.
"We want to salute Fort Fairfield," Bob Johnston, president of Spudstock Entertainment Inc., explained in his choice of the show opener. Johnston and his partner, Jim Ossie, are both Fort Fairfield natives who say the festival was planned as an economic boost to the town. They expect 30,000 people to show up.
Other acts signing on in the last few days are Doug Kershaw, a Cajun fiddler; Tongue Lash, an alternative rock group; and Dakota, composed of musicians from northern Maine and Canada.
Following Headcleaner in the Friday lineup will be Devonsquare, Bill Chinnook and the East Coast Horns, Rick Derringer, The Outlaws and Blue Oyster Cult, ending at 2 a.m. Saturday.
Rustic Overtones will start Saturday's 16-hour concert at 10 a.m. followed by Broken Men, Boneheads, Signs of Life, Skate the Razor, Tongue Lash, Twisted Roots, Quiet Riot, Guess Who and Eddie Money, ending at 2 a.m. Sunday.
Silver and Lace will open Sunday's performances at 10 a.m. Dakota, Doug Kershaw, and then John Anderson will wind up the festival at 4 p.m.
Johnston said contract riders on a majority of the national acts prohibit any type of camera or recording devices in the concert area.
While declining to release the number of tickets sold to date, Johnston said sales were "brisk" and reflected a "pent-up demand" for such an event.
"We're ready to make the Spudstock concert experience one of total joy ... great music, plenty of good food and beverages, wide-open spaces, that great Aroostook sky," Johnston said. "Everything people will need for a hassle-free good time is awaiting them."
The festival area on the 103-acre farm located 3.5 miles from town on the Center Limestone Road has been expanded with 27 adjacent acres for additional parking.
On Wednesday, the Spudstock sign was in place, a row of portable toilets had been brought in, utility workers from Maine Public Service were on site, fencing was going up, a tractor was pulling equipment over the grounds and some of the 27 committed vendors were choosing spots to set up business.
Fort Fairfield Police Chief Neil Saucier, who is coordinating security around a one-mile perimeter of the concert area, said 24 officers were assigned each day to cover the 72-hour period from Friday through Sunday. Some will be patrolling with all-terrain vehicles.
Johnston said the Portland-based security firm hired to work inside the concert area will bring about 50 people to town. He is advertising for volunteers to form a "peace patrol" and help with other aspects of the festival.
Metal detectors and "pat-down" searches will be utilized to keep out weapons and unauthorized alcohol. Two beer gardens will be set up inside the gate with doubled fencing to prevent passing beverages to the crowd.
Wrist bands given to patrons at the gate will permit concert access throughout the weekend.

Abstract: Polished teak and mahogany-finished runabouts, a Bolger triple-keeled sloop, sleekly elegant yachts, and tireless workhorses of the sea will be moored together for three days this month at the 1995 WoodenBoat Show in Southwest Harbor. The WoodenBoat Show is sponsored by WoodenBoat Publications of Brooklin, the publisher of WoodenBoat Magazine. Before the 1994 show in Southwest Harbor, the company had staged the event for two years in Newport, R.I. The homegrown Maine business brought the event home to local waters for its 20th birthday celebration last year. Its whopping success on MDI -- drawing 30 percent more attendees than the 1993 event in Newport -- prompted show organizers to return for another year to Southwest Harbor. According to Valerie LaFrance, show manager, WoodenBoat intends to take the show on the road in 1996 to another region.

Full text: SOUTHWEST HARBOR -- Polished teak and mahogany-finished runabouts, a Bolger triple-keeled sloop, sleekly elegant yachts, and tireless workhorses of the sea will be moored together for three days this month at the 1995 WoodenBoat Show in Southwest Harbor.
The Mount Desert Island community is playing host for the second consecutive year to an event that was a huge success last July, when more than 10,000 people streamed into the Hinckley Great Harbor Marina. About 3,000 people attended the 1994 show during the first four hours.
This year the show is two weeks earlier and will run from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday through Sunday, July 14, 15 and 16. As last year, parking is available at the Hinckley Co. lots in Manset, with frequent shuttle buses running to and from the marina.
The WoodenBoat Show is sponsored by WoodenBoat Publications of Brooklin, the publisher of WoodenBoat Magazine. Before the 1994 show in Southwest Harbor, the company had staged the event for two years in Newport, R.I. The homegrown Maine business brought the event home to local waters for its 20th birthday celebration last year.
Its whopping success on MDI -- drawing 30 percent more attendees than the 1993 event in Newport -- prompted show organizers to return for another year to Southwest Harbor. According to Valerie LaFrance, show manager, WoodenBoat intends to take the show on the road in 1996 to another region.
More than 130 wooden boats are promised for this year's event, as well as 75 of what show organizers call the "finest wooden boat builders, designers, and repair experts" in the business.
Kayaks, skin boats, row boats and canoes will line up on one finger of the dock where builders of 12- to 30-foot crafts will be featured. Boats in the 35- to 50-foot category, moored at another finger, will include such exhibitors as Benjamin River, Walsteds Yard of Denmark, Billings Diesel, Sam Devlin from Washington state, and International Classic Yachts.
Several historic vessels will moor at the C dock -- the 1926 Herreshoff Aida, the Shew & Burnham-built power cruiser Chewink, the Bahama schooner Anne, the Joel White trawler yacht Maine Idea, the 1961 ketch Sojourner Truth, the famous Arctic schooner Bowdoin from Maine Maritime Academy, and others.
Boats along the main dock -- the D dock -- will include the Bequia dinghy Snake, a flotilla of Dick Pulsifer's Hamptons, a Chesapeake Bay oyster buy boat, the "Elderyacht," which is specifically designed for older sailors, the William Hand motorsailer Sixpence, and the Balmy Days which will offer short charters during the show.
Alongside the B dock will be moored Yorel, the 83-foot Eldredge-McInnis motoryacht built by Hodgon Bros., the 1950 motorsailer Burma and the 1930 8- meter Angelita representing Rumery's Boat Yard.
A popular boat last year, the 63-foot Alden schooner When and If will return for the 1995 show. The boat was built in 1939 for Gen. George Patton. Rockport Marine will show its winter project Arawak, a 1931 Starling Burgess design, along with two other sailboats and a powerboat.
Brooklin Boat Yard will bring Sweet Olive, a 1991 Joel White design; High Cotton, a recently built Herreshoff Buzzards Bay 25; and the 1913 P Class sloop Olympian.
The 1925 Alden schooner Heart's Desire will offer short boat trips during the show.
Abundant exhibits are offered at the event, from historic exhibits to boats for sale. Smaller tents hold the exhibits of hardware, wood coatings and cleaners and chandlery supplies. Booths will include exhibits of spars, tools, sails, fasteners, models, books, ropework and more.
Tickets at the gate will be $7.50 per person and free for children under 12. Once inside the gate, attendees will be handed a guide to the event and a ballot to vote for their favorite boat in the show. Show organizers ask that all pets be left at home.

Full text: A story published in MaineDay Wednesday about Open Farms Day, which will be held Sunday, July 9, failed to note that Paul Birdsall's Horsepower Farm in North Penobscot raises market vegetables and storage crops.
About 120 Maine farms will open their doors to visitors on Sunday, July 9, to help educate the public about the production of everything from cattle to clams.
Nathan Pennell, office manager for the Soil and Water Conservation District in Machias, said the event will give families an opportunity to have fun while experiencing Maine agriculture.
This is the sixth year for the Open Farms Day.
In Somerset County, one of the more unusual farms opening its operation to the public is the fiber farm operated by Robert and Leah O'Donnell in Canaan.
The Fiber-Lee Farm is on Lazy Lane.
This is a small but growing farm where fleece is taken from animals and processed so it can be spun into yarn. Angora rabbits are the O'Donnells' main source of fiber, augmented by fleece from Cashgora goats.
The O'Donnells will instruct visitors in the care of Angora rabbits and what to do with the fiber. There will be demonstrations of spinning, blending and carding at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
In Skowhegan, William and Leona Thomas will hold Open Farm Day at Rocky Hill Acres on Route 2, a miniature-goat farm. The Thomases raise registered Pygmy goats and Nigerian dwarf goats for sale and show. There is also a miniature horse on the Thomas farm.
Pamphlets will be available on both breeds of goats and videos of goat shows, births and baby goats.
Two Somerset County orchards will participate: North Star Orchards, operated by Judith and Everett Dimock, on Orchard Road in Madison, which will offer wagon rides through the orchard and displays and a retail store; and The Apple Farm on Back Road in Fairfield, which grows 30 acres of apples, pears and plums.
Other farms in Somerset County included in the event are: Weston Farms, Weston Avenue, Madison, vegetable and sheep farm with hand-spinner's exhibition and retail products available; Mountain Road Farm, Mountain Road, St. Albans, dairy goats, with a farm store, tour, petting of animals allowed; Jerry Sass Tree Farm, School Street, North Anson, tree farm with 75 acres of mixed soft and hardwoods, bandsaw demonstration; Good Will Farm, Greene Road, Hinckley, dairy farm with milking at 3 p.m., and tours.
North in the County, an educational farm staffed by high school students at Presque Isle, is one of three farms that will be open to offer an opportunity to learn about food and fiber.
The 38-acre farm owned by SAD 1 has an apple orchard, 5 acres of strawberries and raspberries and a variety of vegetable crops. The products are marketed through an on-site store off Academy and State streets.
Students will provide tours of their greenhouse and other sectors of the farm between noon and 5 p.m.
Other Aroostook County farms involved in the statewide event are the Wood Prairie Farm, owned by Jim, Megan, Peter and Caleb Gerritsen on the West Road at Bridgewater. The potato, vegetable and livestock farm will be open between 1:30 and 5 p.m.
Open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. will be the Shakaree Red Deer Farm on the French Road in New Limerick and the Red Bridge Farm on River Road in Oakfield.
The Shakaree Red Deer Farm has the largest herd of red deer, 650 deer on 200 acres, in the eastern United States. Owners Gary Dwyer and Mark Drew will explain venison production and breeding stock. More than 100 deer will still have velvet on their antlers.
Washington County will provide a unique opportunity for visitors making their way to the only soft-shell clam hatchery in the world at Beals Island.
The hatchery supplies clam seed to municipal shellfish management and conservation committees throughout the state. The visitors center, featuring historical pictures of the clam industry, will be open from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
Atlantic salmon are raised in the ocean off Washington County. Maine Salmon Inc. raises salmon and steelhead trout in floating cages on Cobscook Bay. Boat tours will be conducted by the Marine Technology Center and the Washington County Technical College from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
In Hancock County, Horsepower Farm in North Penobscot will feature blueberries grown organically, a yarn spinning demonstration, draft horses at work, wagon rides, and lambs, piglets and chickens from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The annual farm day is sponsored by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, the Soil and Water Conservation District, the Maine Department of Agriculture and Threshold to Maine RC&D Area Inc. These agencies can provide information on additional farms open for visitors on Sunday.

The Brooklin facility is the education field office of the research organization whose headquarters are in New York City. Hoyt's hiring in May to run the institute's expanding educational programs was no fluke. As a mammologist with a soft spot for mollusks and other sea life, Hoyt looks pretty natural amidst the marine mammal models of the MERI office in Brooklin village.

Full text:   BROOKLIN -- After 15 years working in zoos and museums out of state, Reg Hoyt has returned to his native Maine and to his first love, marine science.
Having recently relocated here from the desert Southwest, Hoyt has gotten his feet very wet indeed, running education programs for a marine research field office and pursuing an aquaculture venture on the side.
The Bangor resident recently became program director of the Marine Environmental Research Institute facility in Brooklin, where a full range of summer programs for children and adults begins this week. Offerings include naturalist-led cruises and island walking tours.
MERI was founded in 1989 after marine research scientist Susan Shaw became concerned that large numbers of marine mammal strandings in the late 1980s might be traceable to environmental pollution. The Brooklin facility is the education field office of the research organization whose headquarters are in New York City.
Hoyt's hiring in May to run the institute's expanding educational programs was no fluke. As a mammologist with a soft spot for mollusks and other sea life, Hoyt looks pretty natural amidst the marine mammal models of the MERI office in Brooklin village.
"As a child, I was a very avid beachcomber, extremely interested in marine life," said the Sanford native, who "started a saltwater aquarium before anyone said you could."
Hooked on marine sciences, he became disillusioned at a state college he attended in Florida when he couldn't inspect his plankton samples because microscopes were available only to graduate students.
After a stint in the Navy, Hoyt returned to Maine temporarily to enroll at Nasson College in Springvale, a smaller school more suited to his tastes. Ironically, a severe foot disorder made him switch his focus from marine sciences to "more terrestrial" work.
Once warned he might not be able to walk by age 35, Hoyt couldn't see slogging through mud flats indefinitely. He turned to museum work until he realized he preferred live creatures to preserved ones.
During several years in zoo work in the South and Southwest, he ran breeding programs for threatened species such as black-footed ferrets and Mexican wolves, appearing on television shows including "Captain Kangaroo."
Hoyt fondly remembers taking fox kits onto the show. "That was quite fun because the kits were extremely gentle," he said. But one wee critter, apparently attracted to the captain's bright yellow sleeve, took a firm toothhold and would not let go.
Hoyt's last job before returning to Maine was as curator of collections for the Phoenix Zoo. Successful foot surgery has helped smooth his transition to Maine and MERI, where his duties include leading short cruises for adults.
On two-hour trips perusing the waters of Naskeag Point, Eggemoggin Reach and Blue Hill Bay, Hoyt discusses the natural history of the area and its islands. Sightings of seals, porpoises, osprey, bald eagles and sea birds are as frequent as the tides.
MERI has permission to visit several privately owned islands, including Hog, Sheep, Pond and Babson. Each has its own character, says Hoyt. Sheep Island has the denuded character one would expect from sheeps' mowing, and Hog Island bears the remains of clay-firing pits.
The institute's children's programs aim at strengthening observation skills. Each program starts with a slide show preview of the creatures kids can expect to see. A licensed captain and naturalist then loads the children onto an inflatable Zodiac, zipping out to an uninhabited island for a day of exploring and discussion.
Naturalist Cydney Smith of Blue Hill, whose background is environmental science, says even local children are surprised to learn how much they don't know about their surroundings. They can identify seaweed, but not which of three local types they're treading on.
Past mussels and periwinkles, youngsters find themselves speechless in the game of naming species. Asked to name their favorite part of the day, first-timers usually holler "the boat ride!" Smith says.
Nonetheless, children seem eager to rethink their assumptions and misconceptions and to return to learn more. MERI does a brisk business in returning students, said Hoyt, whose own interests include oyster and nori aquaculture.
The Friday Explorer program most fully unleashes the talents of staff naturalists, Hoyt said. A coming workshop will entail tracing the form of a humpback whale onto Route 175, and counting how many car lengths fit into the stenciled shape.
Having recently presented programs at Blue Hill and Brooklin primary schools, MERI hopes to increase its educational outreach, although the stretch may depend on foundation funding.
MERI is a membership organization, depending on $25 donations from individuals and the occasional larger infusion from organizations such as the Brooklin Garden Club.
Hoyt is about to raise the organization's local visibility by entering an inflatable minke whale replica into Brooklin's Fourth of July parade. Fluke bearers will flap their wares alongside.

Abstract: Town officials and resident clam diggers say they've had enough of clam rustlers. They are taking steps to protect the town's clam beds with a conservation program that should stop out-of-town clam rustlers in their tracks. First Selectman Verland Lenfestey, chairman of the newly formed Beals Island Shellfish Committee, said Monday that he would hand-carry the town's proposed clam conservation ordinance to Commissioner William Brennan in Augusta.

Full text: BEALS -- Town officials and resident clam diggers say they've had enough of clam rustlers. They are taking steps to protect the town's clam beds with a conservation program that should stop out-of-town clam rustlers in their tracks.
First Selectman Verland Lenfestey, chairman of the newly formed Beals Island Shellfish Committee, said Monday that he would hand-carry the town's proposed clam conservation ordinance to Commissioner William Brennan in Augusta.
A group of Beals residents, including several professional clam diggers, formed a clam committee last week. They elected Lenfestey as chairman and Ordman "Skipper" Alley Jr. as secretary.
Resident diggers recently complained to Lenfestey and his board that commercial non-resident clam diggers were openly harvesting the town's managed clam beds because the town has no ordinance that protects the beds.
Although the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery at Beals provides clam seedlings to several other coastal communities in the state, the town of Beals has failed to protect its own clams from out-of-town clam rustlers until now.
After Lenfestey and his committee fill out the appropriate clam conservation ordinance application papers, requesting approval from the Department of Marine Resources, Lenfestey and Duane Carver will hand-deliver the application to the DMR. Carver has expertise in clam and water sampling.
After the DMR gives conditional approval to the ordinance, Lenfestey will present the proposed ordinance to Beals voters for local approval. Then, with DMR's final approval, non-residents would be allowed to dig clams from Beals flats only in accordance with licensing regulations set forth in the ordinance.

Prohibition is always a bad idea

Author: Robert E. Prasch and Falguni A. Sheth

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]04 July 1995: 1.

Abstract: Richard Kochi's recent Op-ed column ("Letalize pot? Let's not.", BDN, June 24-25), was a provocative argument, articulate and impassioned, in support of the current prohibition of marijuana. Unfortunately, it was deeply flawed in its analysis of the issues surrounding marijuana usage. For those who missed Kochis' piece, the following paragraph summarizes his major points: If Kochis is to make his point successfully, he must establish that there is no legitimate, non-pernicious use of marijuana. Such an argument would be parallel to the grounds upon which the state has deprived us of the "privilege" of owning anti-aircraft missiles -- used properly, such a weapon has no purpose other than one that we would all wish to avoid. As a society, we simply cannot reasonably foresee a safe, legitimate use for such weapons by private citizens. However, such a case cannot be made for marijuana. Besides its usefulness in easing the pain of cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy, and in helping to cure glaucoma, moderate use of marijuana has been the source of pleasurable recreational usage -- for those who desire it, in the privacy of their own homes. However, society has a strong interest in preventing the use of automobiles and heavy machinery while under the influence; citizens will also be inclined to enforce age restrictions on users. Yet, neither of these restrictions is exceptional or the grounds for a sweeping prohibition; as we can see, these are already on the books for the use of alcohol and tobacco.

Full text: Richard Kochi's recent Op-ed column ("Letalize pot? Let's not.", BDN, June 24-25), was a provocative argument, articulate and impassioned, in support of the current prohibition of marijuana. Unfortunately, it was deeply flawed in its analysis of the issues surrounding marijuana usage. For those who missed Kochis' piece, the following paragraph summarizes his major points:
For Kochis, marijuana should remain illegal because:
(1) people misuse marijuana (driving under the influence, getting high before school, etc.);
(2) people exhibit a psychological dependency on marijuana.
Furthermore, Kochis rejects arguments for legalization because he finds that:
(3) there are few concrete economic benefits to "hemp" as followers like to claim;
(4) the prohibition issue is not about individual rights since the misuse of marijuana involves costs to society;
(5) people who support legalization are simply trying to "rationalize their need to get high."
We would like to address each of these points in turn.
First, outlawing a product or an activity because of potential misuse by some individuals is as irresponsible as those peole who do the misusing. For example, matches, firearms, and boats are all great sources of convenience and, in certain contexts, recreation. On the other hand, when misused, they are important causes of tragic injuries or death. In fact, individually and collectively, they are the source of more fatalities than marijuana.
If Kochis is to make his point successfully, he must establish that there is no legitimate, non-pernicious use of marijuana. Such an argument would be parallel to the grounds upon which the state has deprived us of the "privilege" of owning anti-aircraft missiles -- used properly, such a weapon has no purpose other than one that we would all wish to avoid. As a society, we simply cannot reasonably foresee a safe, legitimate use for such weapons by private citizens. However, such a case cannot be made for marijuana. Besides its usefulness in easing the pain of cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy, and in helping to cure glaucoma, moderate use of marijuana has been the source of pleasurable recreational usage -- for those who desire it, in the privacy of their own homes. However, society has a strong interest in preventing the use of automobiles and heavy machinery while under the influence; citizens will also be inclined to enforce age restrictions on users. Yet, neither of these restrictions is exceptional or the grounds for a sweeping prohibition; as we can see, these are already on the books for the use of alcohol and tobacco.
As to his second point, it may be true that some individuals develop a psychological dependency on marijuana. However, the individuals upon whom Kochis, as a drug counselor, is basing his argument constitute a "sample bias." He obviously will never counsel those who are neither psychologically nor physically dependent upon marijuana, nor will he be likely to interact with those individuals who have achieved academic distinction, promotions, and job success regardless of their marijuana intake. We should add that people develop attachments to all kinds of things including alcohol, cigarettes, sailing, sex, and television. Again, the experiences and traumas of an unfortunate few are not legitimate grounds for so Draconian a policy as a categorical ban on a widely used drug. Just because shellfish may cause anaphylactic shock for some who are allergic to shrimp, it would be ludicrous to prohibit everyone from enjoying seafood. Recall that a prohibition passes a negative judgment on a large number of people who are otherwise law-abiding citizens. Are we to do this because of the difficulties of an unfortunate few?
Leaving the rights question aside, is a prohibition policy cost-effective? Do we not then create new psychological problems when we arrest otherwise law-abiding citizens and deprive them of "life, liberty, and happiness" because some other people show signs of dependence when they use marijuana? Legislating for all citizens based upon the traumas of a few individuals is not only illogical, but unbelievably patronizing. What we can do is offer assistance and guidance to those who need it, instead of saddling so many well-adjusted, upstanding citizens with criminal records and prison sentences for responsibly engaging in an otherwise consensual, socially harmless acitivity. The fact that someone, somewhere, takes a risk by trying marijuana is not grounds for passing a penalty which encourages the state to harass so many of our fellow citizens.
Third, Kochis suggests that the pro-legalization groups are disingenous when they claim that "hemp" has a wide variety of valuable and economically profitable uses. To an extent, he is correct. The fact that rope or baskets can be made from hemp does not make this product the basis of an economic miracle. However, there is economic value in the ability to tax and regulate the distribution of a legally saleable product. Moreover, the expense that goes into the DEA, narcotics police, local police efforts, mandatory drug counseling, etc. -- could be diminished or eliminated with the legalization and regulation of marijuana. The potential for very real savings on these programs would be tremendous, which is a point that Kochis overlooks when he urges readers to think of reducing social problems. Instead, a number of worthy programs could be funded, such as a civil service corps, subsidizied housing, etc. Alternatively, taxes could be lowered without this extravagant public expense.
Fourth, Kochis claims that a legalization argument based on "individual rights" does not hold water since "clearly there are social costs." Those may be the worst argument in Kochis' piece. Of course, there are social costs! Social -- and political -- costs are a necessary and legitimate burden of all rights. Consider the O.J. Simpson trial. before the days of individual rights, we could have saved Los Angeles County millions of dollars by torturing a confession out of the defendant, regardless of guilt or innocence. Social and political justice means individual freedoms must be balancedf with individual responsibilities. The cost of political freedom is responsible citizenship. The cost of recreational sex without protection can be exorbitant. But to abolish individiual liberties, on the assumption that no one is able to be responsible for themselves, sounds eerily like no freedom at all.
Finally, Kochis tells us, not once, but twice, that he suspects that those who favor the legalization of hemp are not publicly interested, but rather self-interested, i.e. rationalizing their own desire to "get high." What a fallacious and slanderous statement. We sincerely doubt that prominent conservative thinkers such as Milton Friedman, William F. Buckely or George P. Shultz are simply trying to pull one over us while they secretly "inhale." Although he attempts to belittle many public-spirited contributors to an important debate, Kochis implicitly agrees that one can be both self-interested and correct. He is idenitified at the end of the column as the "clinical coordinator for Substance Abuse Services at the University of Maine." As one who lives off of tax and tuition dollars, it is clear that Kochis has a stake in the outcome of the prohibition debate. People who read his condescending statements concerning the motives of those who favor legalization might be led to think that "people in glass houses..."

Abstract: That was the traditional Fourth of July fare in Maine and throughout New England when wild Alantic salmon ran in great numbers in the region's rivers and streams in June and early July back in the 18th and 19th centuries. The custom was to poach the fish and serve it with boiled white potatoes and green peas picked fresh from the vine. As people make their way through Ellsworth to Mount Desert island and points Down East this holiday, they may spot some trim, yellow and green signs pointing the way to Sullivan Harbor Farm in East Sullivan, where Leslie Harlow and Joel Frantzman produce a subtly-flavored, cold smoked Atlantic salmon that makes a unique gift for hosts and a fitting appetizer to serve guests on the Fourth. A lean, agile man clad in jeans and a salmon-colored Lacoste shirt, Frantzman darts about amid various shiny stainless steel contraptions. He and assistant Michael Bloomfield are preparing to slice the salmon. They lift deep amber-colored fillets from shelves in a stainless steel rack wheeled out of the reaches of the cold room kept at 28.6 Fahrenheit -- well below the maximum temperature allowed by the state.

Full text: Salmon and peas.
That was the traditional Fourth of July fare in Maine and throughout New England when wild Alantic salmon ran in great numbers in the region's rivers and streams in June and early July back in the 18th and 19th centuries. The custom was to poach the fish and serve it with boiled white potatoes and green peas picked fresh from the vine.
As people make their way through Ellsworth to Mount Desert island and points Down East this holiday, they may spot some trim, yellow and green signs pointing the way to Sullivan Harbor Farm in East Sullivan, where Leslie Harlow and Joel Frantzman produce a subtly-flavored, cold smoked Atlantic salmon that makes a unique gift for hosts and a fitting appetizer to serve guests on the Fourth.
Built in 1820 by Capt. James Urann, Sullivan Harbor Farm has the air of an old English country house with its granite terrace, kitchen garden, perennial beds and flowing green lawns. So it was somewhat of a surprise to discover the sleek, high-tech operation housed in the renovated barn.
It's 9 a.m. and morning light streams through the skylight and classical music drifts through the air of the smokehouse. The sun-filled rooms are spare and spotless. They have been made appealing to the eye with powder blue counter tops, flecked oyster and white floor tiles and modern artwork adorning the walls.
A lean, agile man clad in jeans and a salmon-colored Lacoste shirt, Frantzman darts about amid various shiny stainless steel contraptions. He and assistant Michael Bloomfield are preparing to slice the salmon. They lift deep amber-colored fillets from shelves in a stainless steel rack wheeled out of the reaches of the cold room kept at 28.6 Fahrenheit -- well below the maximum temperature allowed by the state.
Frantzman shows Bloomfield how to peel back and remove the salmon's silvery skin in one swift, clean motion. One-by-one, fillets move through a German machine that cuts them into minute slices about 1/8 of an inch thick. They emerge and drop onto pristine, acrylic plates. The fillets are then vacuum-packed and readied for market.
Frantzman says the process actually begins when a southbound seafood truck grinds to a halt at Sullivan Harbor Farm and drops off a load of freshly harvested Atlantic salmon several times a week. The salmon is washed, stored in a cold room, and washed again before being cured in a mixture of salt and brown sugar.
The fish is then slowly cold smoked over a mixture of hickory, applewood and beech chips for about 10 hours in a Scottish-style kiln.
The difference between cold and hot smoked fish is simple. In the latter method, the flesh is actually cooked. The difference in taste is a matter of palate.
The Irish, Scottish and Norwegians are famed for their cold smoked products. But, as the fish-farming boom has hit the United States, more smokehouses have surfaced in Maine and the Pacific Northwest. In this state, there are at least a dozen, stretching from Portland to Lubec. Appledore, Duck Trap River Fish Farm, Horton's, Bud's and Jim's are among the best known.
Frantzman toyed with the idea of becoming a salmon farmer but decided it was too risky given the great capital investment required and uncontrollable factors inherent to the international market dominated by Norway. Smoking fish seemed more feasible given the abundance of farm-raised salmon in Maine.
No stranger to the food business, he ran a sporting camp for more than a decade on Little Lyford Pond near Gulf Hagus Gorge in Piscataquis County. He served guests a cold smoked salmon imported from Nova Scotia. He recalls how the fish was tasty but Saran-wrapped and sent via regular mail.
A woman with a broad smile, twinkle in her eye, and long blond hair, Leslie Harlow is an old hand at the food business. She co-owned and ran the Town Farm Restaurant in Bar Harbor and Orono.
She and Frantzman combed the Maine coast for a suitable location for their combination B&B/smokehouse. Three years ago, they discovered and bought the rambling, former Sullivan Harbor Inn, with its main house, barn and guest houses. It's a perfect site since it sits right beside U.S. Route 1 -- the highway on which much of Maine's farm-raised salmon travels to market.
A jungle had grown up in front of the 175-year-old captain's house and obscured the ocean view. A former Outward Bound instructor, Frantzman's mountaineering skills came in handy for limbing the immense trees. The house was not insulated and there was a litany of other repairs to be done.
Never having smoked fish, Frantzman spent a month at the Torry Research Station in Aberdeen, Scotland, learning everything from proper washing to cold smoking. He also gleaned advice from the operators of small smokehouses on the Isle of Skye and other parts of Scotland.
It's taken a couple of years but all the hard physical work and research is starting to pay off.
In the summer, Frantzman and Harlow get steady orders from the nearby summer colonies of Sorrento, Hancock Point and Grindstone Neck in Winter Harbor. They also ship smoked salmon around the country in the offseason.
The couple has also gone wholesale.
The founder and president of the Massachusetts-based seafood restaurant and retail store chain, Legal Seafood, gave Sullivan Harbor Farm a big chunk of business after sampling its fresh-tasting, flavorful salmon. Orders are coming from the Manhattan gourmet food company, Dean & DeLuca, Southern Seasons in Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and the West Point Market in Akron, Ohio.
While they are excited by the growth, they don't want to be consumed by their business and not enjoy life. Frantzman thinks one full-time employee is about enough.
"That's the limit of how we see ourselves," he says.

Full text: DEER ISLE -- Sometimes playing scientist in your garage can pay off, as it did for conservation panel members recently honored with a state award for monitoring water quality.
According to chairwoman Cherie Mason, at any given time the Deer Isle Conservation Commission's work might involve poring over water testing samples or working with high school students to plant a wildflower meadow.
But the panel's work monitoring water quality won it the 1994-95 Sterling Dow Award, recently presented by the Maine Association of Conservation Commissions in Augusta. The Deer Isle commission's joint initiative with the state Department of Marine Resources led to the reopening of parts of Crockett Cove for shellfish harvesting, marine resources technician John Fendl of the DMR said Monday.
"We were thrilled when we got the award," particularly since other town commissions' projects seemed equally impressive, Mason said.
Recipient of a separate $1,000 award honoring her as an "environmental woman of action," Mason is known locally for founding the WERU-FM "Environmental Notebook" show, and as author of the children's book "Wild Fox."
Mason and her commission colleagues decided to give the prize money to Deer Isle Elementary School for installation of miniature greenhouses there.
Modeling its testing effort on another group's successful project, the Deer Isle commission tapped $3,500 in state grants to monitor water quality. Some money received from the state eventually was used to set up a water testing lab at Deer Isle-Stonington High School.

Abstract: Author of "Easygoing Entertaining: The `Harry's Wild About You' Cookbook," Harry Schwartz is an ebullient, happy-go-lucky sort of guy who laughs easily and often. Endowed with the kind of laid-back temperament often associated with southern climes, the Iowa native makes his primary home in Florida, but has a summer home in Maine. A dread of Maine winters drives Schwartz from his Surry summer home each September back to coastal Florida, where the chef-philanthropist works at perfecting his own style of casual entertaining. His new book's marble-pink cover shows a deeply tanned Schwartz looking relaxed, to say the least -- his blousy, white shirt splayed wide open at the neck, his blooming five o'clock shadow framing his thick moustache.

Author of "Easygoing Entertaining: The `Harry's Wild About You' Cookbook," Harry Schwartz is an ebullient, happy-go-lucky sort of guy who laughs easily and often. Endowed with the kind of laid-back temperament often associated with southern climes, the Iowa native makes his primary home in Florida, but has a summer home in Maine.
A dread of Maine winters drives Schwartz from his Surry summer home each September back to coastal Florida, where the chef-philanthropist works at perfecting his own style of casual entertaining.
His new book's marble-pink cover shows a deeply tanned Schwartz looking relaxed, to say the least -- his blousy, white shirt splayed wide open at the neck, his blooming five o'clock shadow framing his thick moustache.
"Life's really precious, and it's short, and I don't have to dress up to enjoy it," says Schwartz, during a recent interview. His amusement at that revelation erupts into high-pitched, spiraling laughter. He says a host must feel comfortable before he can put his guests at ease.
Biographical notes say Schwartz began cooking at the age of 5, taught by his mother, a talented cook and hostess whose artistic flair also made for some memorable table settings.
After college, Schwartz bought Borg Steel, a scrap-metal business in Tulsa, Okla., where he and wife Laurie opened two restaurants.
"I used to think everything about my life there was perfect, except for looking out the window and seeing a wall. I wished I could have looked out on the ocean," he once remarked.
Scrapping the metal business, the couple, who have a 7-year-old daugher, Alexa, bought a home in the Palm Beach, Fla., area, opening Surf & Sky Cuisine, a catering firm serving boats and private aircraft.
At home in Florida, Schwartz prides himself on maintaining a tight schedule.
"By 9:15 a.m., I have run four miles, swum a few laps, showered, dressed, walked Pongo (our Boston terrier), fed Felini (our Siamese), packed Alexa's lunch and snack for school, reviewed her spelling words, delivered her to her teacher and arrived at my office," he once wrote in a column. "As I sit down at my deck with a stomach that's craving a jalapeno cheeseburger with fries and a cola, but a metabolism that allows me some fat-free apricot yogurt and an apple, I begin to think about the rest of my day."
The day could include writing a newspaper column, working on a kitchen design, or planning a fund-raising event he will host, as he has done many times before. Some of the proceeds from his book will go to well-known charities.
Schwartz's current push is for his own television show, or at least a regular spot on someone else's.
"There is a feeling that happens when they go `4-3-2-1' that I can't explain. Live TV is my first choice -- it's so exciting," he said.
Earlier this month, he appeared on the "Today Show," grilling not only a lobster, but also a salad and a dessert for hosts Bryant Gumbel and Katie Couric. He is booked to appear on "Mike and Mattie" and "Regis and Kathie Lee."
When his work day ends, Schwartz may be found manning his regular post (the grill on his back deck), in uniform (running shorts and T-shirt), preparing dinner for his wife and daughter.
Schwartz says his ultimate dinner party would pair a few close friends and family, with Barbra Streisand singing during dinner. Celebrities he has cooked for include Burt Reynolds, Gary Collins and Peter Fonda.
Over the years, Schwartz started to put his original recipes into a computer, eventually compiling 200 for the book just out from Seaside Publishing of St. Petersburg, Fla.
Stressing simplicity, the book advises relying on fresh, readily available ingredients whenever possible. "I can't run to 14 different places to make dinner, and nobody else has the time to do it either," says Schwartz.
After visiting friends in Maine, the Schwartzes decided to look into buying a house here.
"We flew into Bangor, and stayed at the Blue Hill Farm Inn," Schwartz recalls. "Immediately we were smitten, found some builders to interview, and just rolled ahead."
They frequently entertain at their Newberry Neck home. One of his favorite gigs is impromptu catering of artists' receptions at the Leighton Gallery in Blue Hill.
Schwartz says Mainers are amply compensated for the severity of the weather, with respites such as shrimp in February, and fiddleheads in May. His idea of heaven is Maine in August and September, when he can shop at the Blue Hill Farmer's Market, and go to the Blue Hill Fair.
Here are some recipes from his book, which includes chapters on table settings, outdoor cooking, buffets, and the cuisines of the Orient and Southwest. Several of the photographs were shot in Maine by Lynn Karlin of Belfast.
Lobster Soup
1/4 cup butter or margarine 1/2 cup minced onion 1 cup sliced mushrooms 1/4 cup minced garlic 1 tablespoon cracked pepper 1 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2 1/2 cups whole milk or 1 1/2 cups milk and 1 cup cream for richer soup 1/4 cup tomato puree 1 1/2 cups cooked lobster meat, cut into chunks Oyster crackers or crusty French bread to serve with soup
In a deep, heavy pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat until foam subsides. Add onion, mushrooms, parsley, garlic, pepper, and salt to pan and stir four to five minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and sprinkle flour over the top of the contents of the pan, stirring and cooking for two minutes longer. Slowly stir in milk and tomato puree and cook while stirring until soup thickens.
Stir lobster meat into soup and cook two minutes more. Serve hot with oyster crackers and/or crusty French bread with butter.
Carrots with Blueberries And Pistachios
1/2 cup balsamic vinegar 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 3 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 tablespoon cracked pepper 3 tablespoons minced fresh shallots 1 teaspoon salt 3 cups grated sweet carrots 1 cup fresh blueberries, cleaned and rinsed 1 cup shelled pistachio nuts
Mix together the vinegar, oil, sugar, cracked pepper, shallots, and salt. Toss with carrots, blueberries, and pistachios. Cover and refrigerate up to four hours before serving. Serves 6-8.

Abstract: Leaving deadlines in its wake like chum gone bad, the Marine Resources Committee has given itself until Monday to absolutely, positively produce a lobster bill no one really seems to want, but many say Maine desperately needs. The essence of a compromise bill is to restrict entry into the business and to limit the number of traps allowed each fisherman, measures the independent-minded industry has long opposed, but now says are essential to stave off intervention by the National Marine Fisheries Service. The service estimates Maine lobster is overfished by 20 percent and stands ready to impose a management plan should Maine fail to act. A compromise version that has been on the committee's table for two weeks calls for a 1,200 trap limit, and some form of apprenticeship program and a license moratorium, with numerous exceptions, to limit entry. The bill also proposes dividing the coast into five zones, with elected councils of fishermen able to impose even more severe restrictions.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- Leaving deadlines in its wake like chum gone bad, the Marine Resources Committee has given itself until Monday to absolutely, positively produce a lobster bill no one really seems to want, but many say Maine desperately needs.
The essence of a compromise bill is to restrict entry into the business and to limit the number of traps allowed each fisherman, measures the independent-minded industry has long opposed, but now says are essential to stave off intervention by the National Marine Fisheries Service. The service estimates Maine lobster is overfished by 20 percent and stands ready to impose a management plan should Maine fail to act.
Maine now has 6,500 lobstermen fishing an estimated 3 million traps in its premier $75 million fishery with entry open to all and no trap limit.
The committee started more than a month ago with three bills, proposing trap limits ranging from 800 to 1,200 and provisions restricting entry, including a moratorium on new licenses, a rollback in the number of licenses to the 1994 level and a four-year apprenticeship program for newcomers.
A compromise version that has been on the committee's table for two weeks calls for a 1,200 trap limit, and some form of apprenticeship program and a license moratorium, with numerous exceptions, to limit entry. The bill also proposes dividing the coast into five zones, with elected councils of fishermen able to impose even more severe restrictions.
The deadline for committees to report out bills to the full Legislature was June 2, but Marine Resources, with some members in favor of trap limits and some adamantly opposed, was nowhere close to a consensus and so was granted an extension until this week.
The situation deteriorated at what was supposed to be the committee's final work session Wednesday, when those in favor of trap limits could not agree on an actual number and the entire panel was all over the map on how to restrict entry and the length of the apprenticeship program.
Many lobstermen stormed from the room, furious that the committee appeared to be on the brink of failure.
Fearful that a committee split three or four ways would not be taken seriously by the full Legislature, Sen. Jeffrey Butland, co-chairman of the committee, held a pair of meetings in his office Thursday, one for those favoring trap limits and the other for opponents, to try to get the 13 members back into two clearly defined camps.
The tactic seems to have worked for the pro-trap-limit side, which settled on a limit of 1,200, giving fishermen using more than that eight years to cut back.
That group also agreed to let the Department of Marine Resources design an apprenticeship program for new lobstermen, with a minimum length of two years, requiring experience as a sternman and seminars in biology, law and fishing practices. Those exempt from the apprenticeship program include those who held a lobster license or owned and operated a lobster boat before March 31, and those who held another commercial fishing license, other than shellfish and worms, before March 15.
Exceptions granted by individual appeal include those who let their license lapse for medical reasons and those who made a substantial investment in lobster gear before March 31. The DMR also would have rule-making authority for establishing an undetermined number of local management zones.
The anti-limit side did not reach agreement on any alternate legislation. A legislative source said Friday the attendance at the sessions in Butland's office suggest the pro-limit side may have at least the seven members needed to produce a majority report.
The committee then canceled what was supposed to be its final work session Friday to spend the weekend polling the lobstermen back home, promising to hold its final, final session at 1 p.m. Monday.

Full text:   WINTERPORT -- The Calvary Apostolic Church will celebrate its 50th anniversary this weekend.
The church actually opened its doors in July 1944, but did not hold regular services until the spring of 1945.
Originally, the church was located in a building on Main Street, but in 1988 a new structure was built on Route 1A, just north of Winterport village.
The Rev. W.E. Strout, the current pastor, arrived at the church in the fall of 1985. Strout is a graduate of Texas Bible College, where he received his bachelor's degree in theology.
The attendance at Strout's first service 10 years ago was 43, but the congregation soon began to see steady growth.
Seventeen acres were purchased and members of the church labored to build the present facility, which seats 250 people.
Since then, the church also has started a van ministry, which reaches into several communities. The Sunday school, under the direction of Leroy Mayhew, has 33 staff members and a class for every age.
Because of its growth, the church also now employs a full-time associate pastor, the Rev. Bruce Briggs. A new building project, which includes plans to enlarge its sanctuary, Sunday School rooms and offices, is under way. The Community Food Bank also will be housed in the new facility.
On June 4, the church will celebrate both its anniversary and the Pentecost Sunday.
The Rev. Robert Linder, an evangelist from Oyster Bay, N.Y., will preach at the morning and evening services. The morning services begin at 10 a.m., while the evening services begin at 6 p.m.

Abstract: Every windjammer worth its salt has a legend, a story about its glorious past, a special niche among the Maine Windjammer Association lineup. Each boat and captain has its fans. Each customer has a favorite vessel, for reasons only he or she can explain. The 95-foot ketch Angelique of Camden, with Capt. Mike and Lynn McHenry, is unique in that it was built and designed especially for the windjammer trade when it was conceived in 1980 by Imero Gobatto. The unique design features a deckhouse salon. The 89-foot schooner J. and E. Riggin of Rockland, captained by Dave and Sue Allen was built in 1927 for the oyster dredging trade and is noted for its speed. The Riggin won the first and only oyster schooner race on Delaware Bay decades ago. The Riggin was discovered and revitalized in 1974, and is now a National Historic Landmark.

Full text:   CAMDEN -- Every windjammer worth its salt has a legend, a story about its glorious past, a special niche among the Maine Windjammer Association lineup. Each boat and captain has its fans. Each customer has a favorite vessel, for reasons only he or she can explain.
The 95-foot ketch Angelique of Camden, with Capt. Mike and Lynn McHenry, is unique in that it was built and designed especially for the windjammer trade when it was conceived in 1980 by Imero Gobatto. The unique design features a deckhouse salon.
The 80-foot coaster Grace Bailey of Camden (alias Mattie), captained by Ray and Ann Williamson, was built in 1882 and hauled timber and granite to the West Indies until 1940.
The 89-foot schooner J. and E. Riggin of Rockland, captained by Dave and Sue Allen was built in 1927 for the oyster dredging trade and is noted for its speed. The Riggin won the first and only oyster schooner race on Delaware Bay decades ago. The Riggin was discovered and revitalized in 1974, and is now a National Historic Landmark.
The oldest in the fleet is the 64-foot coastal schooner Lewis R. French of Camden, captained by Dan and Kathy Pease, launched in 1871 in Christmas Cove. She earned her keep for a century hauling salt, fish, coal, lime bricks and even Christmas trees along the coast.
The 90-foot Mary Day of Camden, captained by Stephen and Chris Cobb, was built in the early 1970s, the first pure sail schooner built in Maine since 1930.
The 78-foot Mercantile of Camden, with Captains Ray and Ann Williamson, was built in Little Deer Isle in 1916 and carried fish, barrel staves and firewood for the lime kilns of Rockport. It became a cruise schooner in 1942 under industry founder Capt. Frank Swift.
The 82-foot schooner Nathaniel Bowditch of Rockland, captained by Gib and Terry Philbrick was built as a racing yacht in 1922 in East Boothbay and won special honors in the 1923 Bermuda Race. The Bowditch served under the Coast Guard during World War II.
The 112-foot Roseway of Camden, captained by George and Leslie Sloane, was built in Essex, Mass., in 1922 to be used as a sports fishing yacht, but spent 32 years escorting ships through Boston Harbor for the Boston Pilots Association. She has been carrying passengers since 1975.
The 78-foot Timberwind of Rockport, captained by Rick Miles, was built in 1931, and served as Portland's pilot boat for 38 years before being converted to a cruise schooner in 1969. She has never left Maine waters.
The 170-foot three-masted "ram schooner" Victory Chimes of Rockland was built in 1900 in Bethel, Del., to carry lumber up and down the shallow bays of the Chesapeake. The vessel was abandoned, then discovered and restored by Capt. Frederick Guild. The Chimes, now captained by Kip Files and Paul DeGaeta, is the only remaining three-masted schooner carrying passengers. The vessel was renamed the "Domino Effect" when it was purchased by a pizza magnate in the mid-1980s. But it returned to Maine and its original name in 1990.
Although it is bad form to mention it in Camden, Rockland has taken away the mantle of the "windjammer capital of the world," once available space was all taken up in Camden.
Rockland schooners that have chosen not to join the Maine Windjammer Association include the North End Shipyard fleet of Heritage, American Eagle and Isaac H. Evans, the Barnes family fleet of Pauline and Steven Taber plus independents Wendameen and Surprise.
For more information about schooner cruises, call the Maine Windjammer Association at 1-800-736-7981. Those windjammers not belonging to the association can be found in the telephone directory under their individual schooner names.

Full text: TOPSHAM -- A Harpswell man has been charged with aggravated assault on a woman in a case that investigators believe is linked to last week's melee at the Harpswell Town Office over clamming licenses.
Topsham police said a criminal summons has been issued to Michael Taylor, 34, who is scheduled to be arraigned June 14 on the charge stemming from a May 23 assault on Kitty Garland.
Garland, 29, of Brunswick was thrown from a car and spent the night hospitalized with a broken jaw and a large bruise on her head, investigators said.
The assault came within hours of the violence at the Harpswell Town Office that officials likened to a small riot. The melee occurred when angry diggers showed up at a meeting of the town's shellfish committee to protest the revocation of clamming licenses.
Garland is the sister of Scott Moody, the chairman of the shellfish committee.

Red tide causes closures State's mussel ban expands

Author: The Associated Press

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]29 May 1995: 1.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/413846334?accountid=10457

Abstract: It's impossible to predict whether newly expanded mussel harvesting closures due to the red tide will last a few weeks or the whole summer, a Department of Marine Resources official says. The state last Tuesday banned the harvesting of mussels and carnivorous snails from the New Hampshire border to Cape Elizabeth, then expanded the ban a day later to include the area between Basin Point in Harpswell and Small Point in Phippsburg. The state also closed an area around Phippsburg to the harvesting of all shellfish. That area is from Bald Head to northern Bear Island.

Full text: PORTLAND -- It's impossible to predict whether newly expanded mussel harvesting closures due to the red tide will last a few weeks or the whole summer, a Department of Marine Resources official says.
"This happens every year," said DMR's Robert Lewis. "Some years the problem is hardly noticeable, some years it approaches disaster proportions."
The state last Tuesday banned the harvesting of mussels and carnivorous snails from the New Hampshire border to Cape Elizabeth, then expanded the ban a day later to include the area between Basin Point in Harpswell and Small Point in Phippsburg.
The state also closed an area around Phippsburg to the harvesting of all shellfish. That area is from Bald Head to northern Bear Island.
Red tide is caused by algae that contains a natural toxin and it can be fatal if ingested by people, but the closures have the potential to hurt the shellfish harvesting industry as well.
"Red tides always make shellfishermen a little bit nervous," said Thomas Fahey, Harpswell's shellfish warden. "It can really cut down on the harvest and the amount of money they make."
Red tides are caused by blooms of microscopic plants. In Florida and California, the blooms turn the water red, but the algae in Maine is greenish and is not visible in the water, Lewis said.
The plants enter the meat of shellfish because of the way shellfish filter water through their bodies to feed. Red tides do not affect fish, lobsters or crabs.
People can get sick from eating shellfish contaminated by red tide because the microscopic plants contain a poison called saxitoxin.
Saxitoxin is one of the most toxic natural substances on earth, said John Hurst, who tests shellfish for the state. It hinders the ability of the nervous system to function, Hurst said.
One of the worst red tide outbreaks occurred in 1972, when 30 people in New England got sick. Lewis said there are no recorded cases of anybody in Maine dying from red tide poisoning.
For shellfish harvesters, the red tides limit the area where they can work at a time when shellfish are in the highest demand and selling for the highest prices.
Fahey said that during the summer, a bushel of about 1,200 clams will sell for about $150, three times as much as the rest of the year. "This just adds to the tension of being in this business," he said.

Abstract: A Harpswell selectman plans to ask the state to close the local clam flats for 30 days as a result of a brawl in the town office that he likened to a rugby match. Fists and furniture flew Tuesday evening in the melee that went on for 10 to 15 minutes. Dozens of people were caught up in the fisticuffs and some suffered minor injuries, including bruises and a possible broken ankle. Selectman Ronald Johnson said he plans to ask Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden to shut down the Harpswell clam flats for 30 days.

Full text: HARPSWELL -- A Harpswell selectman plans to ask the state to close the local clam flats for 30 days as a result of a brawl in the town office that he likened to a rugby match.
Fists and furniture flew Tuesday evening in the melee that went on for 10 to 15 minutes. Dozens of people were caught up in the fisticuffs and some suffered minor injuries, including bruises and a possible broken ankle.
At least two people may face assault charges, said Cumberland County Sheriff's Deputy Terry Goan. He would not name the two and said the matter was being investigated by the District Attorney's Office.
Although it was unclear who threw the first punch and what triggered the violence, it appeared to be linked to unrest over the lifting of commercial digging licenses held by three people whom officials claim are not residents of the town.
Selectman Ronald Johnson said he plans to ask Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden to shut down the Harpswell clam flats for 30 days.
"These guys are going to have to be sent a message that stuff like that doesn't go on in this town," Johnson said.
An argument between Shellfish Committee Chairman Scott Moody and Paul Burr preceeded the violence. Burr is one of the three who lost his license and is threatening to challenge the town's action in court.
Moody, who has held the shellfish committee chairmanship for the past year, successfully lobbied for the town to break off a longtime arrangement in which diggers from Harpswell and Brunswick could work the flats in either community.
Johnson was at a meeting downstairs in the town office when he heard the fight break out upstairs and went to see what was happening.
Johnson said he saw two piles of 40 to 50 bodies rumbling, "just like rugby football."

Abstract: The Waterville native has a booming orthopedic practice in Portland. But for three or four weeks a year, if your satellite dish is aimed right, you're apt to spy him standing on the sidelines of sports venues all over the world. He's the one with his eyes focused at knee-level. "My practice is limited to sports medicine, basically the knee," said the 49-year-old surgeon, who once played American Legion baseball for John Winkin in Waterville. "I spend 100 percent of my time on the knee. My specialty is knee reconstruction, ligament reconstruction, and arthroscopic surgery. A day doesn't go by I don't see a college or high school athlete." Remember Kirk Matthieu, the record-setting running back for Maine Maritime Academy a few years back? It was [Doug] Brown's surgical skill that kept Matthieu on the field, enabling him to rush for 5,180 yards despite two serious knee injuries.

Full text:   If you can fix a damaged knee, the world of sports is your oyster.
Just ask Doug Brown, M.D., quite possibly Maine's best-traveled sports figure of the moment. That is, if he's not off in some operating room rescuing another limping athlete's career.
The Waterville native has a booming orthopedic practice in Portland. But for three or four weeks a year, if your satellite dish is aimed right, you're apt to spy him standing on the sidelines of sports venues all over the world. He's the one with his eyes focused at knee-level.
"My practice is limited to sports medicine, basically the knee," said the 49-year-old surgeon, who once played American Legion baseball for John Winkin in Waterville. "I spend 100 percent of my time on the knee. My specialty is knee reconstruction, ligament reconstruction, and arthroscopic surgery. A day doesn't go by I don't see a college or high school athlete."
Remember Kirk Matthieu, the record-setting running back for Maine Maritime Academy a few years back? It was Brown's surgical skill that kept Matthieu on the field, enabling him to rush for 5,180 yards despite two serious knee injuries.
That ability is also what's kept Brown traveling from Russia to Central America to South America tending to the knees and other aching parts of some of the top amateur athletes in the U.S. He travels at the teams' expense. Knee experts get to do that.
"I started out as a team physician at the U.S. Naval Academy," Brown said, replaying his introduction to his now two-decades-old global practice. "Through contacts there I got involved as an Olympic volunteer, which is basically a three-step program."
Step one, Brown was a physician at the U.S. Olympic training site at Colorado Springs in the early 1980s. He did so well he was selected to work the Olympic Festival, step two.
The third step is to work international events, which Brown began doing at the World University Games in Japan in 1985.
Since then, Brown has made 19 trips all around the globe with various U.S. amateur athletic teams. Women's gymastics... men's soccer... Lately, women's soccer. He's a physician for the U.S. Soccer Federation.
Next up: Brown will accompany the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team to Sweden for the second World Cup Championship games beginning June 6.
That's a long way for a former Bowdoin College hockey and baseball player to travel.
"I was always involved in athletics as a participant. When I got into orthopedic surgery, that choice was related to my previous experience in sports. I saw a lot of injuries. When I was doing my residency at the University of Vermont in the early '70s, sports medicine was just beginning," Brown explained.
He is a now a seasoned pro in the field. He performs more than a hundred knee surgeries a year. On the road, he deals with sprains, bruises and the psychological wounds that come with them. He even stitched up the forehead of a female soccer player who collided with another player trying to head the ball.
All those years of experience have led Brown to make some observations about modern sports and the human anatomy. Among them:
Women injure their knees in competition significantly more often than men.
"That's absolutely true in my practice. The incidence of serious knee injuries in young women, particularly women basketball players, is very high, for reasons we don't understand. The rate of injury is about double the rate of men in basketball. That's something that needs to be studied," Brown said.
Soccer is not the injury-free sport many parents believe.
"Soccer has attracted parents because it's non-violent. If you focus just on the knee, soccer is no free ride. The injury rate is only a little less than football," he observed.
Today's athletes are no more or less injury-prone than their predecessors.
"Increased participation is the reason there are so many knee injuries. A friend of mine does a lot of research in skiing. He's found the rate of injury hasn't diminished, it's stayed constant." Brown said.
The reason U.S. teams need someone like Brown traveling with them is simple.
"The major need for a physician is on extended trips outside the U.S. where you need a friendly face if anything happens," said Doug Brown, a friendly face, but more importantly, someone who knows how to fix a knee.

Abstract: Promoters of the planned Spudstock music festival have announced the headliners for the July event. Joining the lineup for the three-day concert set for July 21-23 in Fort Fairfield are John Anderson, Eddie Money, Blue Oyster Cult, The Guess Who and Rick Derringer. "This is not a single-performer event," said Bob Johnston, co-promoter of the event with Jim Ossie, both Fort Fairfield natives. "Even the lesser-known bands have horsepower in and of themselves."

Full text: Promoters of the planned Spudstock music festival have announced the headliners for the July event.
Joining the lineup for the three-day concert set for July 21-23 in Fort Fairfield are John Anderson, Eddie Money, Blue Oyster Cult, The Guess Who and Rick Derringer.
This quintet was added to 11 previously announced artists, which includes the Outlaws and Quiet Riot. Talent procurer Chuck Kruger of Thomaston estimated that the bands involved have racked up 150 Top 10 hits. He said Thursday that another one or two acts could still be added.
"This is not a single-performer event," said Bob Johnston, co-promoter of the event with Jim Ossie, both Fort Fairfield natives. "Even the lesser-known bands have horsepower in and of themselves."
Johnston said that the talent budget "exceeded six figures."
Country singer John Anderson is probably the hottest of the announced acts. His hit singles include "Country `Til I Die," "Money in the Bank," "Seminole Wind" and "Straight Tequila Night."
Rocker Eddie Money, who played in Bangor only last year, is best known for the 3-million seller "Two Tickets to Paradise." His other hits include "Take Me Home Tonight," "Baby Hold Onto Me" and "Shakin'. "
Guitarist Rick Derringer first gained popularity in the McCoys, with the chart-topping tune "Hang on Sloopy." He went on to perform with both Johnny and Edgar Winter, and to record the hit single "Rock & Roll Hoochie Coo."
"Don't Fear the Reaper," Blue Oyster Cult's signature tune, was on everyone's radio back in 1976. The tune made a comeback last year, heard in the Stephen King miniseries "The Stand."
Canadian rockers The Guess Who, with original members Jim Kale and Garry Peterson, will be bringing such hits as "American Woman", "Undun" and "These Eyes."
Tickets for Spudstock are being sold as a three-day package only, not in single-day increments. Tickets, which are general admission only, are $39 in advance and $50 the day of the show. Children under 12, accompanied by a parent or guardian, will be admitted free. Free camping will be available on the site located on Fort Fairfield's Center Limestone Road.
With the lineup pretty well set, Johnston confidently predicted, "We're going to sell 30,000 tickets, and probably have to turn people away."
Johnston said he was unable to give an estimate as to how many tickets have been sold thus far. But Ossie said that the co-promoters were generally pleased with the way ticket sales were going.
Johnston said that Canadians will make up 40 percent of the audience. Tickets are the same price in Canadian dollars.
"We want to give Canadians every encouragement, every inducement to attend Spudstock," he said.
The Spudstock hot line number is (207) 828-2787.

Shellfish committee rejects clam plan Diggers adamant about keeping control

Abstract: At a public hearing Monday night at the town office, clam diggers and the conservation committee gave local resident Paul Thompson two reasons for rejecting his plan for leasing 10 acres of town clam beds to install about 2 acres of clam demonstration plots. Peter Taylor, one of the town's 54 commercial clam diggers, predicted that if any of Cutler's clam beds were leased to private clam farmers for experimental plots or other uses, the town would lose control over its industry. The day of free digging would be over, he said. His other reason for not wanting government intervention, he said, was because local clamflats have received a windfall of baby clams this spring. "There should be no need for developing a clam seed hatchery in the town," he said. "Seed is in every corner. Our clams are doing well. Clamming is looking up."

Full text: CUTLER -- The shellfish conservation committee wants a $35,000 federal grant used for rearing lobsters or other seafood, rather than for demonstrating how local clams may be grown more productively.
At a public hearing Monday night at the town office, clam diggers and the conservation committee gave local resident Paul Thompson two reasons for rejecting his plan for leasing 10 acres of town clam beds to install about 2 acres of clam demonstration plots.
Peter Taylor, one of the town's 54 commercial clam diggers, predicted that if any of Cutler's clam beds were leased to private clam farmers for experimental plots or other uses, the town would lose control over its industry. The day of free digging would be over, he said.
"We are scared to death to open that door. If we let our clams go, we won't get them back," he declared.
His other reason for not wanting government intervention, he said, was because local clamflats have received a windfall of baby clams this spring. "There should be no need for developing a clam seed hatchery in the town," he said. "Seed is in every corner. Our clams are doing well. Clamming is looking up."
Other diggers stated that Cutler's clam industry would be even stronger if the town was not compelled to sell 10 percent of its commercial licenses to non-residents. "That regulation is no good and we should get rid of it," one digger said. By one estimate, about 1,000 bushels of 2-inch clams are taken each year by non-residents.
Members of the shellfish committee recently completed a spot inventory of clam populations, however, and found Cutler's clam beds to have an abundance of clams smaller than the 2-inch minimum. One sampling, from a plot 2 feet square, yielded 60 clams. The average yield was 15 to 20 clams, however.
Thompson cautioned the diggers that the unusually large amount of tiny seed clams may represent a "one-year class of good seed," while future years may be less productive. "Five to 10 years ago, the seed wasn't here," he said.
In his four-year plan for enhancing the local clam industry, Thompson said he wanted the selectmen to close a 10-acre section of the most underproductive clamflats. He first needed the conservation committee's backing, which he failed to receive at the hearing.
Had his project won committee support, he would have developed a variety of test plots. He would have cleared all clams from some plots and planted baby clams from the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery. The plantings would have been covered with plastic mesh for predator protection. Some plots would have been left unprotected. Yet other plots would have retained existing clam populations.
Thompson, who received the $35,000 grant from the U.S. Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration subject to the committee's backing, estimated that some of his managed plots would have produced double the average daily harvest -- "$200 a day instead of the $100 you now may be earning."
Although the committee did not support Thompson's clam plan, he did receive its strong support for an alternate plan to build a floating lobster hatchery within a private lease of 10 acres of sub-tidal territory in Cutler Harbor. The advantage of a floating hatchery, he said, is that you can expand by just adding another float. In the basement of the town office, where the original hatchery was operated successfully several years ago, there was no space to expand. Dampness from the salt water was bad for the building, and the original lobster hatchery was closed.
Oysters will be included in Thompson's new floating hatchery. "I've purchased some oysters and will be doing some test beds on a small scale," he said.

Tremont unhappy with recycling deal Town vows it won't pay without service

Abstract: Discontent was raised at Tuesday's town meeting about Tremont's recycling contract with a private Southwest Harbor company. Tremont is one of several towns in the area, including Southwest Harbor and Trenton, that contracted with EMR for recycling. As part of that contract, according to Price, EMR agreed to build a facility where recyclables would be accepted and weighed, sorted and baled, and then readied for resale. Each town would then eventually recoup a percentage of the proceeds from the resale. Price said EMR has failed to construct the building, does no weighing by town, and does not sort or bale the recyclables for resale. "Over $250,000 has been sunk into this project by Tremont, Southwest Harbor and Trenton," Price said. "And so far, no building, no balers, no resale program, nothing."

Full text:   TREMONT -- Discontent was raised at Tuesday's town meeting about Tremont's recycling contract with a private Southwest Harbor company.
Selectman Alison Price expressed displeasure with the contract with Eastern Maine Recycling, saying owner Lee Worcester has "breached his contract" with the town.
Tremont is one of several towns in the area, including Southwest Harbor and Trenton, that contracted with EMR for recycling. As part of that contract, according to Price, EMR agreed to build a facility where recyclables would be accepted and weighed, sorted and baled, and then readied for resale. Each town would then eventually recoup a percentage of the proceeds from the resale.
According to Price, those terms of the agreement have not been fulfilled.
"He hasn't lived up to his agreement," Price said, adding that selectmen will meet with Worcester in coming weeks to share mounting concerns that specific parts of the 10-year contract have not been fulfilled after three years.
Price said EMR has failed to construct the building, does no weighing by town, and does not sort or bale the recyclables for resale. "Over $250,000 has been sunk into this project by Tremont, Southwest Harbor and Trenton," Price said. "And so far, no building, no balers, no resale program, nothing."
EMR has indicated that it plans to have the building constructed this summer.
Southwest Harbor voters had a similar opinion at their town meeting last week. Voters there decided to delay appropriating any money for that part of the budget, giving their town officials times to decide whether the contract had been breached. They will continue the town meeting on June 29 to vote on the appropriation.
In Tremont, at the urging of town selectmen, voters appropriated the requested sum for solid waste and recycling. But selectmen assured residents they would be unwilling to pay EMR the amount owed if they found that the terms of the contract were invalid.
"Have faith in us that we will fight this battle," Price said. "We won't pay unless we have to."
With no discussion, Tremont voters slashed to zero a suggested $15,000 appropriation to pay for the disposal of fish and shellfish waste generated by local businesses. Last year the town appropriated $15,000 for the cost of composting 140 tons of crab waste. Without town funds, shellfish dealers will now have to foot that bill.
In other business, the fewer than 70 people in attendance passed the school budget as recommended and agreed the town could borrow up to $25,000 for the construction of a boat access ramp at Bernard. The state, through the boat facilities division of the Bureau of Parks and Recreation, has said it will fund 75 percent of the total cost of the project, which could be about $100,000.
The $25,000 debt will be repaid from the revenue the town generates at the town wharf property. Last year, Tremont earned more than $10,000 in revenue from that property.
Tremont voters on Tuesday also agreed the size of the school board should increase from three to five members, beginning with the 1996 town elections. The school board did not agree the change was needed, but the move was supported by the selectmen.

Abstract: Voters will act on a combined $1.99 million budget at town meeting set for 7 p.m. Tuesday at the community building. Town Manager Fay Lawson said Wednesday that if the budget is approved as recommended by selectmen, property taxes will increase by no more than one mill. That increase would mean an additional $100 in the annual tax bill for property assessed at $100,000. The projected elementary school budget includes a minimal increase, Lawson said. The budget includes funds to rent a portable classroom for next year to deal with overcrowding. The school committee has chosen not to bring a school expansion project to a vote at town meeting, with that decision possibly to come before voters at a special meeting later in the year.

Full text: TREMONT -- Voters will act on a combined $1.99 million budget at town meeting set for 7 p.m. Tuesday at the community building.
Election of municipal officers takes place from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Monday.
Selectman Alison Price is running unopposed for another term. Patricia Pinkham is also unopposed for a three-year term on the school board, a seat being vacated by Don Ellis, chairman.
Town Manager Fay Lawson said Wednesday that if the budget is approved as recommended by selectmen, property taxes will increase by no more than one mill. That increase would mean an additional $100 in the annual tax bill for property assessed at $100,000.
The projected elementary school budget includes a minimal increase, Lawson said. The budget includes funds to rent a portable classroom for next year to deal with overcrowding. The school committee has chosen not to bring a school expansion project to a vote at town meeting, with that decision possibly to come before voters at a special meeting later in the year.
Voters at town meeting will be asked to approve borrowing up to $25,000 for the development of a boat access ramp at Bernard. The state, through the boat facilities division of the Bureau of Parks and Recreation, has given its assurance of state funding to pay for 75 percent of the cost to develop the ramp. The state has said the project should cost less than $100,000.
Lawson said the boat ramp would be for recreational boaters. She said the $25,000 debt would be repaid from the revenue the town generates at the town wharf property. Last year, Tremont earned more than $10,000 in revenue from that property.
Another warrant article likely to stimulate discussion at town meeting is a proposed increase in the size of the school board from three to five members. The article appears on the warrant at the suggestion of a resident who brought the proposal to the Board of Selectmen. The selectmen recommend passage of the article, but it is not supported by the warrant committee.
Lawson said she expects a written resolution from the school board, before Tuesday's meeting, that states the board also does not want to see its membership increase.
The selectmen and warrant committee are making no recommendation on whether the town should raise $15,000 for the disposal of fish and shellfish waste generated by local businesses. The businesses pay to have the shellfish waste trucked to one of two state-approved compost sites. Last year, more than 140 tons of crab waste was composted. The town appropriated $15,000 last year.

Abstract: The town's clam conservation committee is gambling $373 that 1 million baby clams planted Sunday may be worth as much as $49,000 by the fall of 1998. The committee expects to reap at least $28,000 if the town harvests the 1 acre of clam beds that was reseeded in the new Norris Pinkham Sr. Memorial Clam Restoration Project, located off Oak Point in Flat Bay. Walter Shafer, secretary for the clam committee, said in an interview Tuesday that if the reclamation project results in a 60 percent clam survival rate, the next three spring and summer growing seasons should produce 400 bushels of 2-inch clams valued at about $70 a bushel -- or a total market value of $28,000.

Full text:   HARRINGTON -- The town's clam conservation committee is gambling $373 that 1 million baby clams planted Sunday may be worth as much as $49,000 by the fall of 1998.
The committee expects to reap at least $28,000 if the town harvests the 1 acre of clam beds that was reseeded in the new Norris Pinkham Sr. Memorial Clam Restoration Project, located off Oak Point in Flat Bay.
Sixteen clam diggers and eight Narraguagus High School science students worked three hours Sunday to plant 1 million three-eighths-inch baby clams.
Walter Shafer, secretary for the clam committee, said in an interview Tuesday that if the reclamation project results in a 60 percent clam survival rate, the next three spring and summer growing seasons should produce 400 bushels of 2-inch clams valued at about $70 a bushel -- or a total market value of $28,000.
"Should those 1-year-old clams enjoy a survival rate of 100 percent, they could grow to 700 bushels, or $49,000 on the open market three years from now," said Brian Beal, a University of Maine at Machias marine scientist. He assisted the committee in its largest clam restoration project.
Shafer explained that the project got a lot of cooperation from the Department of Environmental Protection, a local lobster pound owner, volunteer clam diggers, and NHS students. It got 2 1/2 5-gallon buckets of baby clams from the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery.
A major player in the project was Richard Dorr, who wanted to expand his lobster pound about 1 acre on Flat Bay. Through an accord with the DEP, he agreed to compensate for taking of clam flats by putting up the $2,000 used to purchase 1 million clams from the hatchery for the restoration project.
Dorr also donated $500 toward Harrington's cost of purchasing $1,373 worth of plastic netting, leaving the town with a total dollar investment of only $373. The approximately 1 acre of quarter-inch mesh netting was later cut into 64 bed covers. Each cover measured 14 by 24 feet.
With committee Chairman Jim Benner supervising Sunday's reseeding project, the 64 seed plots were each seeded by Beal. He said it was the largest town clam seeding project that he had experienced in his eight years of work as consultant for the hatchery. He added it would be the only project of such size this year in Washington County.
Clam diggers dug 6-inch-deep trenches around each of the new 64 12-by-20-foot clam beds. Then the students, under supervision of NHS science teacher Ed Reynolds, cut the plastic netting into 64 covers that were placed on top of the clam beds to protect the baby clams from predators.
Edges of the netting were locked into place by a 6-inch-deep covering of mud. Participating students were Kelly Benner, Ryan Benner, Jim Burns, Andy Brady, Jessica Rau, Lee Shafer, Justin Torrey and Josh Willey.
The committee is considering several options in the management plan for the new clam project, which was named Sunday in honor of Pinkham, who made part of his living harvesting clams before he died on May 17, 1979, while working at Flat Bay.
Shafer said funds from an anticipated clam harvest in 1998 could be used to pay part or all of a clam warden's salary, or to purchase a warden boat. Also, if the clams are not harvested, their seed would help repopulate the Flat Bay region's larger clam beds.

Abstract: Before Rod Mitchell, America's top chefs had to make do when it came to seafood. It wasn't always fresh and it certainly wasn't exotic. "When I arrived 15 years ago everything was fresh frozen," said Jean Louis Palladin, one of the nation's most prominent chefs and owner of Jean-Louis at the Watergate in Washington. "Twice a week I got a plane coming in from Paris. I had to buy fish from Paris and I didn't want to do that because this country can have the best product in the world," he said in a rich French accent. Then Palladin met Mitchell while vacationing in Camden about 15 years ago. Mitchell was running a gourmet shop selling wines, cheese and caviar.

Full text: PORTLAND -- Before Rod Mitchell, America's top chefs had to make do when it came to seafood. It wasn't always fresh and it certainly wasn't exotic.
"When I arrived 15 years ago everything was fresh frozen," said Jean Louis Palladin, one of the nation's most prominent chefs and owner of Jean-Louis at the Watergate in Washington. "Twice a week I got a plane coming in from Paris. I had to buy fish from Paris and I didn't want to do that because this country can have the best product in the world," he said in a rich French accent.
"I said, `Let's see, we are the same coast as France, why is there no fish in America?"' he said.
Then Palladin met Mitchell while vacationing in Camden about 15 years ago. Mitchell was running a gourmet shop selling wines, cheese and caviar.
The chef had an idea. He asked Mitchell to supply hand-picked scallops and fresh fish for his four-star restaurant in Washington, where dinner can easily fetch $100 a person not including wine and tip.
Mitchell agreed and was soon on the road to becoming the supplier of seafood to America's top restaurants.
Mitchell initially ran his business from the back of a pickup truck, driving from Rockland to Boston, buying fish and shipping it along the way. Now the 39-year-old runs a multimillion-dollar operation, Browne Trading Co., from a brick building on the Portland waterfront.
Shipping with Federal Express, Mitchell provides seafood for 150 restaurants -- with distributors in Atlanta and Denver -- but still deals directly with the top 20 or 30.
His client list is filled with renowned chefs at four-star restaurants. Wolfgang Puck in California depends on him, as does Daniel Boulud of Daniel's in New York. Other clients include the Ritz Carlton in Atlanta, Jasper's in Boston, and Lespinasse and Le Bernadin in New York.
"We are dealing with the elite of the elite," said Mitchell, dressed casually in jeans with a baseball cap as he heads to the Portland Fish Auction.
"We've changed the fish industry," he added. "Nobody else does it as well."
His customers agree.
"I could buy (seafood) much cheaper in New York, but it would not be the best. For the freshest and the best, he's the man," said chef Daniel Boulud.
The wholesale prices at Browne Trading Co. vary, with some prices on par with those at other wholesale fish supplies and others higher.
Maine salmon goes for $3.50 a pound. Eight gallons of hand-harvested jumbo Maine scallops are $97.60. The Russian Beluga caviar is $37.50 an ounce.
"I'm only looking for the perfect fish," Mitchell said modestly as he handled a recently caught salmon. He explained that it should be stiff and not soft. In a cod you have to "look at the eyes." Scallops: Flick them with your finger and if they move they're fresh. Don't keep lobster in tanks, and use shaved ice with fish to prevent bruising.
Those are just some of the Rod Mitchell tips to the perfect fish, crustacean or mollusk. That, and, "Never ever trust anyone in the seafood business," he said, adding that he's as picky about suppliers as he is about fish.
For example, a woman in Owls Head is his sole supplier of fresh crabmeat. He only trusts a chef-turned-fishmonger to ship him exotic seafood from Hawaii. And Mitchell had to travel to Russia to find the right caviar man.
Mitchell says there was no one like him 15 years ago because, unlike French food, "American cuisine hadn't grown up enough."
It has now. And it is expanding, with Mitchell filling demands for squid ink, octopus salad, sea urchin and baby eels.
"Little by little we have some products like nowhere else can have in the whole world," said Palladin.
Palladin calls Mitchell's product the "top-notch fish in the country."
"He's good for me and good for all the big shots in New York," he said.

No reason to celebrate Earth Day

Abstract: To live we need clean air, pure water, unpoisoned food, shelter, warmth, friends, etc. Notice that "jobs" and "money" are not among life's necessities; earlier societies survived for millenia without "jobs" or "money." They did have to work, but it was for their own and their communities' well-being, not to fill some bloated corporate/agri-business' pockets. While corporations pay big bucks for self-serving Earth Day ads touting how "clean" they are because they've planted a few trees or recycled a few resources, let's remember how much they waste every day, and that they bring more toxic chemicals into use each year. Then there's Bowater, bringing in waste paper from all over the East Coast to recycle into new paper. Sounds good, doesn't it? What they don't tell us is that many colored inserts and magazines use toxic heavy metals in those pretty colored dyes. When they de-ink the paper, those heavy metal dyes go into the sludge, creating toxic waste, all of which is dumped right here in Maine.

Full text: To live we need clean air, pure water, unpoisoned food, shelter, warmth, friends, etc. Notice that "jobs" and "money" are not among life's necessities; earlier societies survived for millenia without "jobs" or "money." They did have to work, but it was for their own and their communities' well-being, not to fill some bloated corporate/agri-business' pockets.
If we canceled all debts and lessened our "money" needs, we could be more self-sufficient, and less in need of "jobs" with corporate/agri-business. We wouldn't have to do their dirty work -- stripping and poisoning our natural resources. In fact, I'd bet we wouldn't let them do it at all.
While corporations pay big bucks for self-serving Earth Day ads touting how "clean" they are because they've planted a few trees or recycled a few resources, let's remember how much they waste every day, and that they bring more toxic chemicals into use each year.
It's spring, so it's time for another six-month-long spraying of pesticides into our woods, waters, air and bodies, causing great damage to our immune syl;stems and to Maine's natural flora and fauna.
I'm more than tired of having dangerous chemicals poured down on me, how about you?
Then there's Bowater, bringing in waste paper from all over the East Coast to recycle into new paper. Sounds good, doesn't it? What they don't tell us is that many colored inserts and magazines use toxic heavy metals in those pretty colored dyes. When they de-ink the paper, those heavy metal dyes go into the sludge, creating toxic waste, all of which is dumped right here in Maine.
Imports of garbage continued unabated. The incinerators in Portland, Biddeford, and Orrington, the dumps in Norridgewock (waste Management Inc.) and Hampden (Tom Sawyer's toxic mountain) all bring in out-of-state garbage. No one really knows what's in it, and no one's running a geiger counter over it.
Potatoes, blueberries, cranberries, apples, crown, Christmas tree farms, forests, roadsides, railroad rights-of-way, electric power line corridors, all get heavily dosed with chemicals every year.
Our taxes support the University Extension Services, long-time chemical pushers. You and I pay for the university's experimental farms. There the workers, under direction of Extension professors, carry out experiments with unregistered killer chemicals. They basically do the chemical companies' work for them, getting new, "better" (more toxic) pesticides approved for use on crops in Maine. You and I pay for this.
There is little experimentation on clean methods of growing food (bug scientists excepted), professors are allowed to accept "consultant" fees from chemical companies, though we pay them to work full-time for us. (I can hear the uproar now, and watch the professors' letters flow in. Nonetheless, it's true.)
Extension professors are responsible for the debacle in potato country, where they recommended piling up blight-infected potatoes. Common sense would have told anyone that airborne fungus should be moved away, instead of trying to kill it with ever more toxic fungicides.
Now, Extension is recommending even heavier pesticide spraying to kill the potato blights, instead of natural, clean practices. Organic farmers I spoke with, who keep pest camage down by rotating crops, building up soil with natural materials, and growing healthy plants, have had only minimal losses from the potato blights. Any natural farmer who knows planting the same crop on the same land for 50 years is bound to bring serious problems, and a steady diet of chemicals eventually just kills the soil so nothing will do well there.
In "wild" blueberry country, the herbicide Velpar is in our drinking water, and has not only killed plants the growers don't want (some of which are useful herbs), but many blueberry plants as well. You cannot keep dumping plant killers on any plant without doing damage.
Cherryfield Foods (owned by a Canadian conglomerate) is knocking down thousands more acres of Maine woods to make more blueberry barrens, which they plan to spray with pesticides with their usual abandon.
Now they've installed 65 miles of underground irrigation pipes, which lower the Pleasant River and nearby bodies of water to unacceptable levels so that Atlantic salmon and other fish fry will be unable to survive. Not only that, but they plan to use chemigation, where they put pesticides into the irrigation pipes and spray thousands of acres, with, you can bet, lots of leakage into the groundwater aquifer.
Does anyone think the pesticides will not back up into the Pleasant River?
Do you think Cherryfield Foods and Jasper Wyman & Sons own the rivers, our drinking water, the air we breathe? I sure don't.
Do you really want to hear all of this? Probably not. Isn't this just all too depressing? Yes, it is. But we have to know what's going on so we can decide whether we're going to let agriculture and industry kill our Earth or not.
We all know by now that pesticides are killing birds, beneficial insects, shellfish, ocean and freshwater fish, honey bees, animals, and us. Most people loathe the pesticide spraying, but feel helpless to do anything about it.
Can we get beyond corporate/agri-business' wall of selfish, gluttonous indifference? Not by appealing to their consciences, I can tell you. But there are actions we can take which will slow down their poisoning, and, if we persist, stop them:
Talk to your relatives, friends, and neighbors who use pestidides, express your concerns, buy yourself (and them) a subscription to Organic Gardening magazine, 33 E. Minor St., Emmaus, Penn. 18098, $20 a year;
Grow some of your own food;
Join a natural foods co-op to buy organically grown produce, grains, and just about everything else;
Watch carefully whenever pesticide spraying is going on near you. If you see pesticides drifting into water or other non-target areas, call the Pesticide Control Board immediately at 287-2731. Tell them you want to file a formal complaint, and to send an enforcement right away to get leaf samples. Be persistent with them. They're used to listening to sprayers; make them start paying attention to real people;
Fight for true democracy, where you and I make the decisions that affect our lives. If we had true democracy, we would be deciding whether pesticides would be sprayed;
Write letters to the editor of your local papers, the Bangor Daily News, state and federal representtives, and anyone else you think could help;
Join a petition campaign to stop aerial spraying of toxic chemicals in Maine. Toxic trespass (pesticide drift) cannot be controlled from airplanes or helicopters since air currents carry poisons into the lungs of all creatures in the area, including us, within minutes. To get petition forms, call me at 434-6228. We're doing this quickly to get signatures delivered to the Pesticide Control Board by mid-May.
Really read the daily newspaper, especially stories about the environment; get to know what you're talking about so the fake scientists can't snow you. Remember, they're paid to make agriculture and industry look good; we have to speak out for ourselves because no one else will.
No, people, there's nothing to celebrate this Earth Day. If we fight for and win some serious victories this year, then we can celebrate next year. But we need to let corporate America know we are not fooled; underneath their "green" images, they're covered by the same old filth.
We need to let corporate/agri-business know we're not going to let them poison us and our children to death. They need to know that either they clean up their act, or we'll do it for them. We're talking self-defense and survival here, people -- I can't put it any stronger than that. And just a small group can't do it alone. Earth needs YOU!

Abstract: Douglas Lindsay, 32, a scuba diver from Jonesport, said he was gathering urchins about 10 days ago in 40 feet of water off Red Head, the southeast tip of Beals Island, when he found a ship's massive four-blade propeller teetering on a ledgy shelf. With assistance from brothers Carroll and William Merchant of Jonesport, Lindsay spent several days rounding up 20 empty 55-gallon steel drums and ferrying them to the salvage site. Several dozen feet of chain were purchased. The trio spent Saturday and Sunday filling the drums with sea water and lowering them to the propeller that was encrusted with shellfish and other colorful forms of marine life. Lindsay chained the drums to the propeller and filled each with compressed air, but the scheme failed to lift the propeller that he estimated to weigh six tons.

Full text: JONESPORT -- Douglas Lindsay, 32, a scuba diver from Jonesport, said he was gathering urchins about 10 days ago in 40 feet of water off Red Head, the southeast tip of Beals Island, when he found a ship's massive four-blade propeller teetering on a ledgy shelf.
The huge propeller was lost about 75 years ago from a 298-foot steamship named in honor of Maine's 26th governor, Nelson Dingley Jr.
With assistance from brothers Carroll and William Merchant of Jonesport, Lindsay spent several days rounding up 20 empty 55-gallon steel drums and ferrying them to the salvage site. Several dozen feet of chain were purchased.
The trio spent Saturday and Sunday filling the drums with sea water and lowering them to the propeller that was encrusted with shellfish and other colorful forms of marine life. Lindsay chained the drums to the propeller and filled each with compressed air, but the scheme failed to lift the propeller that he estimated to weigh six tons.
"I had to be very careful not to allow the propeller to slip off the ledge," he said. "Although the shelf was only about 15 feet from shore, the next shelf was down about 120 feet or beyond my reach."
On Monday, Jimmy Lenfestey joined the salvage crew to help attach 10 additional barrels. At 2 p.m., as the last barrels were being filled with air, the propeller began rising slowly toward the surface.
The salvage operation required 27 tanks of compressed air.
For the next six hours, Lindsay towed the mass of barrels eight miles to Jonesport's Sawyer Cove Marina, where a crowd of citizens was waiting. For most, it was the largest propeller they had ever seen. It measured 15 feet in diameter. The drive shaft, about 12 inches in diameter, was broken off in the hub of the propeller.
Lindsay, a New Hampshire native who made Jonesport his home five years ago, said he intends to sell the propeller. "I've got an investment of about $1,500 in it, so I need a buyer," he said, adding that the price of naval bronze scrap metal is about 45 cents a pound, making the propeller worth more than $5,000.
Until he finds a buyer, he will display the propeller on the front lawn of his farm home near the Jonesport-Jonesboro town line, about 10 miles from the marina.
According to Victor Alley, a Jonesporter who discovered statistics on the Governor Dingley in a record of Merchant Steam Vessels of the United States, the vesssel was 298 feet long, 60 feet wide, and had an underwater draft of 17 feet. It had a gross tonnage of 3,826 tons and 2,856 net tons.
Its triple expansion engines and four oil-converted boilers produced 2,500 horsepower.
Built in 1899 at Chester, Pa., for the Portland Steam Packet Co., the ship was named in honor of Maine's 26th governor, Nelson Dingley Sr. Dingley served in the 74th U.S. Congress. With his brother, Fred, he owned the Lewiston Evening Journal newspaper. He died in 1899 and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, Auburn. The ship's first home port was Portland.
Bill Barry of the Maine Historical Society at Portland said the ship was designed to include a revolutionary new steel hull. With a crew of 74, it was used as a small ocean liner, carrying passengers and freight between Portland and Boston. Later, the ocean route was shifted to one between Bath and St. John, New Brunswick.
According to Charles Beal of Beals Island, during the latter service route in the 1920s, the ship ran aground at Red Head in the fog and lost the propeller, but survived and was towed to port for repairs.
In 1933, the Governor Dingley was dismantled at Baltimore, Md.

State officials reconsider plan to close clam flats

Abstract: Responding to complaints from clam diggers, state officials may scale back a plan to avert a potential pollution threat by closing clam flats in the Harraseeket River. Walter Foster, DMR's director of industry services, said he proposed the closure because state guidelines required him to assume that more pleasure boats on the river during warmer months pose a pollution threat because they might illegally discharge waste water into the harbor.

Full text: FREEPORT -- Responding to complaints from clam diggers, state officials may scale back a plan to avert a potential pollution threat by closing clam flats in the Harraseeket River.
Last month, the Department of Marine Resources told diggers it would close the rich flats from April 1 to Nov. 1 between the outflow pipe of Freeport's sewage treatment plant and the marinas.
Walter Foster, DMR's director of industry services, said he proposed the closure because state guidelines required him to assume that more pleasure boats on the river during warmer months pose a pollution threat because they might illegally discharge waste water into the harbor.
State officials monitor the clam flats and periodically close some sections to digging for fear that tainted clams could make consumers sick and damage the reputation of Maine's clam industry.
But Foster said he is reconsidering the extent of the closure because of new information he received from town officials, environmentalists and local marine operators.
"They're providing us with the information we need now to make a better classification of the area," he said. "It indicates that the town and the marina operators have worked very hard to support the shellfish harvesters in the area in establishing the Harraseeket River as a no discharge area."
The local Shellfish Commission collected data for Foster that shows the sections of the river now open to digging are not at risk.
The Shellfish Commission is opposed to the closure, but said if the flats must be off-limits it should only be from June 1 to Sept. 15.
Foster said he expected a decision by next week.
"I'm feeling pretty optimistic about it," said Mick McGivaren, who is in charge of water quality testing for the commission.

Abstract: Did you know that the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the lawyer-devouring dinosaur in the movie "Jurassic Park," never lived during the Jurassic period of prehistoric history, but actually came in the later Cretaceous period? There are a few of the gems one can learn while walking the halls of a University of Maine at Presque Isle building, where, after years in storage, vast collections of natural history are on display. For 20 years, there's been an intent to establish a natural history museum, possibly in a separate building on the Presque Isle campus. The lack of funds, however, inhibited the process.

Full text: Did you know that the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the lawyer-devouring dinosaur in the movie "Jurassic Park," never lived during the Jurassic period of prehistoric history, but actually came in the later Cretaceous period?
And would you believe that in the next 50 million years, California will become an island, and Saudi Arabia will meld with the Asian continent?
There are a few of the gems one can learn while walking the halls of a University of Maine at Presque Isle building, where, after years in storage, vast collections of natural history are on display.
Fossils, rocks, turtle shells, and flying prehistoric reptiles are the foundation of what will become the Northern Maine Museum of Science.
"Very few people realize how large a collection we have, partly because we weren't doing anything with it," said Kevin McCartney, the school's sole geology professor.
For 20 years, there's been an intent to establish a natural history museum, possibly in a separate building on the Presque Isle campus. The lack of funds, however, inhibited the process.
About a year ago, McCartney started going through the collections and began putting items in display cases along the halls on the second and third floors of Folsom Hall.
"That's a great way to do it, because that means the museum is right there where students can see it and you're not spending any extra resources to do it," McCartney said.
Working on a shoestring budget, McCartney, with the help of talented students, has started lining the halls with exhibits of natural science and history. With modest university funding and grants from NYNEX and the Davis Family Foundation, display cases were purchased, and the museum started becoming a reality.
If all is ready, McCartney hopes the museum will open in September, when the University of Maine System board of trustees meets at UMPI.
Over the years, the Presque Isle campus has acquired natural history items from a variety of sources.
Leroy Norton, a Presque Isle postal worker, collected "everything he could get his hands on" for about 40 years, McCartney said. Although an amateur, he documented items, such as turtle shells and mollusks, as he collected. Such methods will allow scientists to conduct research.
After Norton died in 1970, his collection, including a storage building, was donated to the university.
Portions of collections from the Portland Natural History Museum and from Ricker College in Houlton ended up in Presque Isle after those institutions closed.
In addition, faculty members have accumulated natural history pieces to use in classes and research.
"Out of all this, the University of Maine at Presque Isle has a very good collection of natural history," McCartney said.
Earl Oman, an UMPI work-study student, has built several displays. Oman's latest contribution is a Pterasaur, a flying dinosaur that lived during the Cretaceous Period. One-quarter the actual size, the replica of the flying reptile hangs in the stairway in Folsom Hall.
With wings outstretched, the dinosaur's eyes seem to follow people as they climb from the second to third floor of the building. The dark coloring of the prehistoric form's body was determined by its scavenger lifestyle, McCartney said.
The dinosaur is constructed out of chicken wire and steel with its body fleshed out in plaster of Paris. It was painted by Jeanie McGowan, a student from Presque Isle.
Oman also built the display "Six Hundred Million Years of Earth History," which depicts the movements of the continents throughout history. It even ventures a guess on what the earth will look like in another 50 million years.
Other displays show a tooth from a woolly mammoth, which is bigger than a grapefruit. One display case contains shark teeth, including one from a now extinct shark that was twice as large as the modern great white shark.
Walls displays depict the topography of Aroostook County and another explains the evolution of the dinosaurs.
Future displays will include a large sea turtle, a scale-model solar system, and aerial photographs of Aroostook County. Presque Isle High School students are helping create a "Power of Ten" display on the metric system.
Other possible exhibits include soil displays and agricultural practices.
Besides elementary and high school groups, the museum will fill a need at the university level, McCartney said.
"In Aroostook County, so many of the students don't have the resources to visit museums in Boston or even out of the County," he said. "This is going to give them an opportunity to see some quality science displays."

Abstract: CUSHING -- In a 90-minute session Tuesday night, Cushing voters rejected a clam ordinance, but passed all articles, re-elected all officers and approved a budget of about $100,000 with little change from last year. "It was one of the dullest town meetings I have ever been to," said Friendship Town Clerk Beverly Zahner-Hoonout following the Tuesday night session, which ended in a mere 55 minutes. In balloting conducted Monday, Peter Mason edged Mary Merrill 159-113 for a three-year term on the SAD 40 board of directors. Carl Mueller was re-elected to a three-year term on the board of selectmen unopposed. Zahner-Hoonout was re-elected to her fifth term as clerk.

Full text: Cushing
CUSHING -- In a 90-minute session Tuesday night, Cushing voters rejected a clam ordinance, but passed all articles, re-elected all officers and approved a budget of about $100,000 with little change from last year.
Town Clerk Norma Gardner, reelected to her seventh term, said Cushing residents couldn't seem to find anything to argue about this year.
Her husband, Richard Gardner, was re-elected as selectman unopposed to a three-year term.
Voters approved $15,000 requested by Fire Chief Arthur Kiskilla for a truck replacement fund. Chief Kiskilla said three of the fire engines are more than 20 years old and require high maintenance.
Friendship
"It was one of the dullest town meetings I have ever been to," said Friendship Town Clerk Beverly Zahner-Hoonout following the Tuesday night session, which ended in a mere 55 minutes.
The voters agreed to raise $368,000, only a slight change from last year's budget. All items were passed as proposed, including a reauthorization of the shellfish ordinance, which passed 166-85.
In balloting conducted Monday, Peter Mason edged Mary Merrill 159-113 for a three-year term on the SAD 40 board of directors. Carl Mueller was re-elected to a three-year term on the board of selectmen unopposed. Zahner-Hoonout was re-elected to her fifth term as clerk.
The town made no decision on a proposal to lease a new firetruck. The truck could be the subject of a special town meeting.
Corinth
About 60 Corinth voters attended their annual town meeting Tuesday, quickly dispensing with 58 articles in 1 1/2 hours.
Voter approval on all monetary requests resulted in a municipal budget of $546,478 for the coming year, according to Donald Strout, town manager. This will increase the tax rate of $9.50 per $1,000 valuation to about $10.
Voters approved a junkyard ordinance which will require all property owners who have three or more unregistered vehicles in their yards to obtain a junkyard permit.
The sum of $60,500 was approved to pay off the first-year payment to close the town's landfill. Strout said Corinth will qualify for the state program where the town will be reimbursed from the state for 75 percent of the closing costs. The estimated cost for the project is $200,000.
Voters also approved an article allowing for $30,000 worth of improvements to the tennis and basketball courts at the town's recreation field and $5,000 to pay for computer programming upgrades at the town office.
Annual elections were held Monday with 49 residents voting.
Frank Thomas won election to a three-year term as selectman, assessor and overseer of the poor. Michael McDonald was elected to a three-year opening on the SAD 64 board and Ardith Vesta was chosen as a trustee to the cemetery committee.
Marie McCorrison was elected town clerk. All candidates were unopposed.
Eddington
Recycling trash and naming roads were two of the hot topics during Tuesday's town meeting.
A total of $4,000 was added to the town's budget for a roadside recycling program, which is expected to begin this summer after the bidding process, according to Town Manager Audrey Fox.
Residents also agreed to let its board of selectmen give names to the town's unnamed public and private roads.
All told, Fox said, the town passed a budget of $348,184. That figure does not include a budget for the school system, Fox added.
Townspeople did vote down a yard sale ordinance, which would have restricted residents to no more than six yard sales per year, including no more than two sales in a 30-day period.
During Monday's town elections, Martin Somers won a three-year term as school district director. Somers won the position over Philip Robinson. Somers garnered 55 votes to Robinson's 34.
Paul Gargan and Russell Smith were each re-appointed selectmen for three years after running unopposed.
Pamela Violette won the 1-year treasurer position, also running unopposed.
Fox said she was very disappointed in the showing of only 53 people, out of a population of 1,900.
Parkman
Parkman residents took no action on proposed amendments to the town's land use zoning ordinance at the annual town meeting Saturday.
Many of those who spoke believed that if their lots met the road frontage and the minimum lot size requirements, that it should be enough.
Town officials had sought to prohibit spaghetti lots with the adoption of a lot ratio of 4-1. They also had hoped residents would amend the ordinance to require anyone to make necessary repairs to damage done to a town road on which maintenance had been discontinued.
About 50 people attended the more than two-hour meeting during which the following were returned to office: Merle Gilbert Jr., Board of Selectmen; Pat Johnson, chairman of the Board of Selectmen; Lorene Bridges, library trustee, and Paul Bridge, HAD 4 director. David Littlefield was elected to the planning board.
Residents traditionally have given the snowmobile excise tax refund to the Parkman Trailblazers Snowmobile Club, but this year a new club also asked for some of the funds. As voted, the West Road Riders Snowmobile Club will receive one-third of the refund if it can show proof of incorporation with the state to the town's tax collector. If they cannot, the full refund will go to the Parkman Trailblazers Club.
Residents approved all other articles in the warrant dedicated to J. Clifford Morin.
Verona
Town meeting begins at 7 p.m. Saturday, March 25, at the town office.
All elected officials, who serve one-year terms, are nominated and elected on the floor at town meeting. Verona has 401 registered voters, and a good percentage of those turn out for the annual meeting each year, according to Town Clerk Vivian Terrill.
Terrill said "nothing controversial and nothing unusual" is included on this year's warrant. The tax rate, she said, is expected to be similar to the current year.
Winn
Although the total budget approved by townspeople Monday is 4.9 percent higher than last year's, the amount to come from local taxes is $1,000 less.
The first half of the 1995 tax bills is due by Sept. 1. The second half is due by Dec. 1. Interest will be charged after Dec. 1.
In municipal elections held during the day, voters re-elected Alan Brown to a three-year term on the Board of Selectmen. Patricia Hussey was re-elected town clerk. Clinton Haynes was re-elected treasurer.
With 13 write-in votes Lynn Thibodeau was elected to a three-year term on the SAD 30 board. No name appeared on the ballot for that post.
Also, with 13 write-in votes, Sharon Webster was elected to a three-year term on the Hospital Administrative District 1 board of directors. No name appeared on the ballot for that post.

Abstract: "If you have a good idea to help the fishing industry, now is the time," Scott Tilton of the National Marine Fisheries Service said Tuesday, as he explained the second round of the Fishing Industry Grant program to area fishermen. The grant program offers $4.5 million to the New England area to finance creative ideas to ease the load on fishing stocks. The deadline for applications is May 5. NMFS will conduct information seminars from 6 to 8 p.m. March 23 at the Ellsworth Library and from 10 a.m. to noon March 24 at the Portland Fishing Family Assistance Center. The FIG program is intended to assist the industry to promote the development of fishing and markets for underused species, develop methods to eliminate by-catch, and to create new business and alternative employment for those in traditional fisheries, according to Virginia Fay, who explained the program to midcoast fishermen at an afternoon session at Rockland City Hall.

Maine made out well in the first FIG round, which awarded $4.5 million to 28 of 201 proposals submitted, Tilton said.
The first round awards included:
$174,000 to develop a computerized jigging machine to John Williamson of Kennebunk.
$37,688 for a shellfish waste project to Albert Carver of Beals Island.
$44,250 for sculpin fisheries project to Kevin Hawkes of Phippsburg.
$50,000 to examine employment in Washington County to Diane Tilton of Machias.
$182,000 to develop a pole fishing industry to collect seaweed to manufacture nori for the Japanese sushi market to Ira A. Levine in Eastport.
$1.1 million to develop a marine hatchery for cod and haddock with $500,000 to Philip Conkling on Swans Island and $668,726 to David Miller at Franklin and Eastport.
Applications approved in New England included 11 proposals to expand harvesting of underused species, nine aquaculture projects and eight new business proposals.
The second round will be changed to emphasize new business opportunities with less emphasis on aquaculture projects, Fay said. Applicants who agree to relinquish multispecies fishing permits will be rated higher than others, she said. The impacts of the proposal will be given greater weight this time, she said.
Applications will be accepted for retraining programs that could take a fisherman off the water for a job in the carpentry or electrical businesses, Tilton said. The first priority will be to help those in the beleaguered groundfish industry, but other traditional fisheries will be considered, he said.
The FIG program is unique in that it asked the fishermen for the best way to help the industry, Fay said.
One St. George fisherman requested information for an application to expand facilities in the area to allow more docking area. Fay said new construction has been excluded from the program, but development of existing areas might be considered.
NMFS has created regional Fishing Family Assistance Centers to act as clearinghouses for information on available programs. Those interested in specific information or applications may contact Tilton at the NMFS office in Rockland at 594-2267.

Abstract: A public forum to discuss the problems and future of the clam fishery in Washington County is being planned for mid-April by the Green Party to include several government, political and development organizations. Larry Lack, a Green Party member from Whitneyville, said Monday that the forum will include several clam research specialists, but the all-day meeting is intended to attract harvesters of clams and marine worms. "Some topics may provoke controversy, but not along party lines," he said. Lack is encouraging one or more municipal clam committee members from each town having clam flats to attend.

Full text: MACHIAS -- A public forum to discuss the problems and future of the clam fishery in Washington County is being planned for mid-April by the Green Party to include several government, political and development organizations.
Larry Lack, a Green Party member from Whitneyville, said Monday that the forum will include several clam research specialists, but the all-day meeting is intended to attract harvesters of clams and marine worms. "Some topics may provoke controversy, but not along party lines," he said.
Lack is encouraging one or more municipal clam committee members from each town having clam flats to attend.
He wants open discussion on the feasibility of organizing clam diggers in much the same fashion as lobster fishermen have united under one or more organizations in the state. An organizer of clam diggers in the state's midcoast area will speak on that topic.
The need for mapping clam and worm beds to determine the location and population densities of clams and marine worms is another topic to be addressed.
While clammers say certain clam beds should be closed to conserve and repopulate the resource, wormers contend they shouldn't be prevented from taking worms from those same beds.
Differences of opinion are expected to surface on the increasingly frequent practice of leasing intertidal clam beds. Leslie W. Ranquist of Minturn has been invited to discuss the success of his 10-year lease of two previously unproductive acres of clam beds on Swans Island.
Although a speakers' schedule and other organizational details were incomplete Monday, Lack said the forum would be held in the lecture hall of the Science Building at the University of Maine at Machias. Saturday, April 15, is the tentative date for the conference, with April 29 an alternate date.
"Much depends upon the availability of speakers," Lack said. A final planning session will be held Thursday, March 23, by Green Party members who have been planning the clam forum since mid-February.
Last Thursday, the Washington County Commissioners gave Lack assurances that they would support the county's clam industry by becoming one of the forum's co-sponsors.
Lack told the commissioners that other co-sponsors included the Sunrise Economic Council, the Washington-Hancock Community Agency, the Republican and Democratic county committees and the Green Party.
"It (the forum) is not intended to grind a political ax ... and we are not doing it in response to the university's (Machias campus) decision to withdraw its financial support from the hatchery at Beals. We are trying to draw out ideas from everyone. It is intended to be an educational effort," he said.
Speakers scheduled to comment on clam history and restoration projects include Will Hopkins, project director for the Cobscook Bay Clam Restoration Project; Brian Beal, assistant professor of marine ecology at UMM and founder of the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery at Beals; Dana Wallace, a clam research scientist; David Clifford, Marine biologist from East Machias; Walter Schafer of Harrington, co-chairman of the Down East Regional Shellfish Committee; and Alan Huston of the Brunswick Clam Conservation Committee.
Hopkins will report on his goal of creating in the Eastport area "a regional team of local clammers, municipal shellfish committees, state and local agencies, scientific researchers, and others to develop a softshell clam habitat restoration and management plan for the Cobscook Bay region."
Last December, Hopkins' project received a $20,000 federal grant from the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Fisheries Reinvestment Program to help establish the Cobscook Bay Clam Restoration Project. The funds are administered by the Eastern Maine Development Corporation through the Sunrise County Economic Development Council.
Since December, the Jesse B. Cox Charitable Trust has provided the project $25,000 in private matching funds for a one-year period. The Nature Conservancy is the trust's fiscal agent.

Abstract: Food "really gets at the heart of your being," according to food historian and newly published author Sandra Oliver of Islesboro. "Whole nations have risen and fallen over it." Published by Mystic Seaport Museum Inc. of Mystic, Conn., Oliver's new book, "Saltwater Foodways: New Englanders and Their Food, At Sea and Ashore, in the Nineteenth Century" is the culmination of decades of research. While her book -- written for and about Mystic Seaport Museum and its exhibits -- focuses largely on the "foodway" of the southern New England coast, it is nonetheless peppered with references to coastal Maine, where Oliver now makes her home on the island of Islesboro, and other places up and down the Atlantic coast.

Full text: Food "really gets at the heart of your being," according to food historian and newly published author Sandra Oliver of Islesboro. "Whole nations have risen and fallen over it."
And although most people fill their bellies at least once a day -- three times a day in this culture -- the role that food plays in human interaction and how food choices respond to technological and social change is a relatively new field of study.
"Food history is social history," Oliver points out. "Food is tremendously indicative of a whole lot of things."
It speaks volumes about distinctions among social classes and sexes, ideas and attitudes, likes and dislikes, customs and religion, she says.
Published by Mystic Seaport Museum Inc. of Mystic, Conn., Oliver's new book, "Saltwater Foodways: New Englanders and Their Food, At Sea and Ashore, in the Nineteenth Century" is the culmination of decades of research.
While her book -- written for and about Mystic Seaport Museum and its exhibits -- focuses largely on the "foodway" of the southern New England coast, it is nonetheless peppered with references to coastal Maine, where Oliver now makes her home on the island of Islesboro, and other places up and down the Atlantic coast.
It was at the museum that Oliver's interest in food history was sparked. And her interest began through her job developing a fireplace-cooking demonstration at Mystic Seaport Museum's Buckingham House in 1971, a time when the topic was largely uptapped.
Her quest for knowledge led her to study hands-on, open-hearth cookery at Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts and to pore over anthropology, folklore, agricultural studies, literature, historical geography, music, cookbooks, diaries, journals, ships' logs and provision lists, and more.
While at the Mystic museum, she started work on a cookbook on fireplace cooking but had to put it aside when she took on the job of supervisor of interpretations in 1978. By the time she left the museum in 1985, intending to write and work in food history, it was clear to her that more than a cookbook was appropriate.
"More is expected of food historians now," she says. "The field continues to develop all the time.
"A book is funny. It kind of inhabits you. I learned new things all the time," Oliver adds.
Also among the sources Oliver scoured for her book were newspapers, town records and probate inventories, manuscripts, period literature, books and more cookbooks, many housed at the museum's G.W. Blunt White Library at Mystic.
The result is a series of historical essays, richly illustrated with color photographs of New England dishes reproduced and depicted on the dinnerware they would have been served on; period engravings and woodcuts depicting food-related activities and advertising; and old portraits and photographs of people and places that figured in New England's cooking and eating traditions, both on land and at sea.
Each essay includes authentic period recipes, many with interpretations for the modern cook. In addition to a complete bibliography and chapter notes, Oliver includes both a cook's index and a general index.
Drawing upon what is known about the inhabitants of three historic homesteads on exhibit at the seaport museum and their contemporaries, Oliver gives us a peek into the kitchen of a Revolutionary War-era housewife and the contrasting cooking and eating habits of two 19th-century households -- a prosperous and pious shipbuilding family, and another, living on the edge and scrambling to get ahead through somewhat dubious business dealings.
Oliver takes us aboard sailing ships and fishing ships, and into the messrooms of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, the forerunner of today's Coast Guard. The ties of New Englanders to the sea brought them into contact with new foods, through seafarers' visits to other lands where they were introduced to exotic foods which they brought back home.
The author also examines traditional holiday fare, and the clambakes, shore dinners and chowder parties and myriad other occasions which define New England cuisine, and the fishing and shellfish industries with which New England so closely identifies.
Oliver will deliver a lecture Tuesday, April 18, at the Freeport Historical Society and is scheduled for a lecture and book signing at June 7 at the Penobscot Marine Museum in Searsport.
Following are some of the many recipes Oliver used to illustrate traditional New England cookery in her book.
Fish Chowder
This recipe originally came from "Hood's Combined Cook Books," published the C.I. Hood & Co., 1875-1885. Note the recommendation:
"Take either a cod or a haddock, weighing about 4 pounds, skin it, cut in small pieces and wash in cold water, take a scant quarter of a pound of salt pork, cut into small pieces and fry brown in the kettle in which the chowder is to be made; for a fish weighing 4 pounds, pare and slice 5 medium potatoes and 1 small onion; place a layer of potato and onion in the kettle, then a layer of fish, then dredge in a little salt, pepper, and flour; keep putting in alternating layers of potatoes, fish and the seasoning until all used; add hot water enough to cover; cover tight and boil gently 30 minutes; add a pint of milk and six crackers, split and dipped in cold water, and cook 10 minutes longer. To sharpen the appetite, take Hood's Sarsaparilla."
Coffee
This is how Charlie York made coffee aboard his fishing boat, the Fish Hawk. Oliver found the directions in the pages of "Charlie York: Maine Coast Fisherman," by Harold B. Clifford, 1974.
"We always measured our coffee in a glass that held exactly a quarter of a pound. We poured the water into our pot up to a certain mark; it made eight mugs. I think the biggest factor was the old blue agate pot that would hold maybe two gallons. It had the essence of coffee in it, like a pipe carries tobacco. Soap never touched it; when it was time to make new coffee we rinsed it overboard to dispose of the old grounds and some drops of sea water clung to it that helped to give it a flavor. We brought the water to a boil, poured in the coffee and moved it off the flame. We had a long-handled wooden spoon that we beat it up with for a minute or two. Then we crushed up an egg in the hand and dropped it in, shell and all; that settled the grounds. After setting for three, four minutes, it was ready to pour."

Abstract: Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, and Ron Kilby of the Washington County Extension office at Machias said the 8-year-old Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery must find new supervisory management and funding if it is to operate beyond Sept. 1. Beal, who will continue to be UMM's free consultant to the hatchery until September, said faculty changes and UMM's budget constraints forced the university last month to withdraw its annual contribution of $3,600 toward the hatchery's operating costs of about $75,000. The hatchery produces about 12 million baby clams each year for towns that manage their clam beds with leadership from clam conservation committees. Those clam committees are staffed in accordance with clam conservation ordinances sanctioned by the Depart- ment of Marine Resources and the participating towns.

Full text:   MACHIAS -- A shellfish hatchery asked the Washington County commissioners on Thursday to set aside some funding that would help sustain its marine industrial research programs and keep the hatchery in the county.
Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, and Ron Kilby of the Washington County Extension office at Machias said the 8-year-old Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery must find new supervisory management and funding if it is to operate beyond Sept. 1.
Beal, who will continue to be UMM's free consultant to the hatchery until September, said faculty changes and UMM's budget constraints forced the university last month to withdraw its annual contribution of $3,600 toward the hatchery's operating costs of about $75,000.
The hatchery produces about 12 million baby clams each year for towns that manage their clam beds with leadership from clam conservation committees. Those clam committees are staffed in accordance with clam conservation ordinances sanctioned by the Depart- ment of Marine Resources and the participating towns.
Coastal towns from Kittery to Pembroke have purchased the hatchery's product at the rate of $2,000 per 1,000,000 baby clams.
Beal said the hatchery "isn't just a clam hatchery. Its programs include sea urchin research, sea scallop culture and lobster culture."
Kilby said that Pembroke, Harrington, Edmunds, Lubec and Addison will receive baby clams in 1995. Several other towns in western and southern Maine have requested seed clams.
Beal said that Eastport's clam beds are under consideration for a reseeding program.
Commissioner Chairman Mary Follis of Eastport said, "We (commissioners) need to look at our budget, which is in a state of flux at this time, to see what we can do" to provide some financial support for the hatchery.
Commissioners Edward Cline and Norman Nelson Sr. agreed to consider the hatchery's financial needs.
Follis said she would "like to see the county wholeheartedly support the hatchery," which would include financial support of a means to dispose of the hatchery's waste.
Beal explained that when the first soft-shell clam hatchery in the nation was established, on Pero Point at Beals in 1987, several towns in the area from Addison to Machiasport joined financially in the hatchery's research program.
The first three or four years failed to fulfill the towns' expectations of an imminent revival of the Down East clam industry.
"We made big mistakes," he said, but in the last four years the hatchery's two full-time employees and about eight UMM work-study students have worked with municipal clam committees to establish a viable reputation.
Brunswick and other southern Maine communities have developed strong clam industries as a result of Beals hatchery clams and the company's detailed management techniques.
"You don't go out and throw the seed on the flats and walk away. (The flats) need to be managed," said Beal.
Kilby promised that the Cooperative Extension budget, part of the university system's budget, also would provide funds to keep the hatchery functioning beyond UMM's Sept. 1 cutoff date.
Kilby said the hatchery could be used for educational purposes, and that its numerous programs could be dovetailed into the existing Washington County Water Quality Program.

Abstract: The hand-knit, thick woolen stockings hung every Christmas in the living room by the fireplace; her lithe, young body swinging from the rafters in the barn; the Fourth of July celebrations with bunches of bananas hung on the door for all the children who lived in the tannery houses across the way; the creamed oysters she ate at President Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration; the way the clouds and the water swelled together on Mattawamkeag Lake when she and her husband, Maurice, canoed on Saturday nights. Color dances all around her. Her crimson dress. Her pink button earrings. Her sparkling, slate blue eyes. I know now that if I could be as bright and sharp and lovely as she is, if I could lift myself from my chair and take a visitor on a tour of the photographs of my mother balancing eggs in her basket, or my father all handsome and whiskered, or my family's version of a Teddy Roosevelt, young and frisky in Island Falls, I would willingly risk it. The daughter of William and Mary Sewall, Cunningham has seen plenty of change. The railroad came through the year she was born. Rows of tannery houses sat across the street.

Full text: Nancy Cunningham will deny it, but she remembers just about everything.
The hand-knit, thick woolen stockings hung every Christmas in the living room by the fireplace; her lithe, young body swinging from the rafters in the barn; the Fourth of July celebrations with bunches of bananas hung on the door for all the children who lived in the tannery houses across the way; the creamed oysters she ate at President Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration; the way the clouds and the water swelled together on Mattawamkeag Lake when she and her husband, Maurice, canoed on Saturday nights.
"He was made for me," she says lovingly. That is what is most memorable about Nancy Sewall Cunningham -- the honest love of a woman for her family.
Color dances all around her. Her crimson dress. Her pink button earrings. Her sparkling, slate blue eyes. I know now that if I could be as bright and sharp and lovely as she is, if I could lift myself from my chair and take a visitor on a tour of the photographs of my mother balancing eggs in her basket, or my father all handsome and whiskered, or my family's version of a Teddy Roosevelt, young and frisky in Island Falls, I would willingly risk it.
A tiny woman with eyes full of energy, Cunningham was born 100 years ago in an upstairs room of the house she still lives in today. With two brothers and two sisters, she was "the foolish baby," she says.
"I was a little scamp," she recalls. "I liked to make mud pies. I would take daisies and buttercups, pull them apart and mix them in. I was very particular about my mud. I used an old box they used to make mortar. I even swiped flour from the kitchen to get the right consistency.
"And sometimes I used to play down in the wagon shed until I came in covered with grease," continues Cunningham. "My mother would say, `Oh, my dear little girl, why do you get so dirty?' My mother was patience boiled down."
Cunningham leans onto her carved cane, as all 106 pounds of her stand catching her balance for a moment before she goes into the kitchen to show a visitor a partridge vine that her nephew Don brought her. All three of her "boys" -- her nephews Sam Sewall, Don Harmon and Bill Sewall -- come to see her every day.
"They are as good men as you could find anywhere," she says.
The daughter of William and Mary Sewall, Cunningham has seen plenty of change. The railroad came through the year she was born. Rows of tannery houses sat across the street. Delmont Anderson had the first automobile. The iceman brought the ice packed in sawdust out from Mattawamkeag Lake. She remembers Emerson's store and M.D. Estes and all the precious penny candy. She remembers heading down the cellar stairs to pop popcorn in the furnace with her father, and she remembers his words to her, "Dotta, this house was built on honor."
And close to that house Cunningham has stayed for most of her 100 years.
"This is where I belong. In this house," she says, quietly.
She did travel to Teddy Roosevelt's inauguration on March 4, 1905, when she was 9 years old. She attended college in Boston briefly. She lived in New York City with friends of the family in 1918 and in Portland with her Maurice for six years until they moved back in 1941, the year "Japan played that awful trick" on Pearl Harbor. They both traveled to the Badlands in South Dakota when the national park was opened.
Cunningham's father, William Sewall, was born in 1845 just two years after Levi and Rebekah Alexander Sewall came up through the woods from Phippsburg to Island Falls. She points to a brass pail hanging by the fireplace that came through those same woods at the same time. Here also is the lapstone on which her grandfather pounded leather for shoes and a cast-iron pressing iron used by her grandmother, a seamstress. Her mother's parents, Caleb and Mary Blakeney Sherman, settled in Oakfield when they arrived from New Brunswick, Canada, in 1864 with nine children, including 3-year-old Mary.
Cunningham loves the plants of the forests and fields with a passion that comes from knowledge and time. Her father first tucked her into the bow of a canoe on Mattawamkeag Lake when she was 3 years old. In those hours and hours spent together roaming the woods of Island Falls, her father passed on his love of nature. Just as his sister Sarah had taught him, he taught her the names and habits, how to recognize the vines and ferns and grasses in their seasonal clothes, the patterns of the clouds hovering over the lake waters. He would bring blue-eyed grass or a little orchid, something alive and indigenous to the fields and forests they loved.
History is important to Cunningham, but she is never stuck in the past. Things do change. "I do say so," she says. "I only wish I was clever enough to tell you."
Sincerely she says that there is no reason for anyone to remember her, but since she's asked, she says, "I want people to remember that I was kind." It is likely she will be remembered as kind, and also welcoming, humble and articulate.
When asked about regrets, Cunningham says only that she would have liked to have been a nurse or a druggist. She taught school, as was the custom for women, for three years until Maurice Cunningham walked her home one night.
He walked her home until three years ago last April 17, when he whispered to her, "We've had a pretty good time, haven't we, Nance?"

Abstract: Since the fall of 1986, my father, Richard Carver, and I have gladly permitted UMM, their faculty and students to use our wharf and attached two-story building and develop adjacent property to accommodate increased production of soft-shell clams with the construction of a 50-foot-by-20-foot greenhouse (1988). Again, in 1990, staff asked us if we would approve the construction of a 20-foot-by-20-foot education center so that visitors to the facility would walk away with a better understanding of the program and its benefits to coastal communities. We did so without hesitation or reservation because we believed, and still do, that this program represents one of the finest examples of positive community outreach that a campus of the University of Maine system enjoys.

Full text: I read with interest, surprise and disappointment the recent article in your paper concerning a decision by administration at the University of Maine at Machias to withdraw its longstanding support of clam enhancement programming through the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery.
Since the fall of 1986, my father, Richard Carver, and I have gladly permitted UMM, their faculty and students to use our wharf and attached two-story building and develop adjacent property to accommodate increased production of soft-shell clams with the construction of a 50-foot-by-20-foot greenhouse (1988). Again, in 1990, staff asked us if we would approve the construction of a 20-foot-by-20-foot education center so that visitors to the facility would walk away with a better understanding of the program and its benefits to coastal communities. We did so without hesitation or reservation because we believed, and still do, that this program represents one of the finest examples of positive community outreach that a campus of the University of Maine system enjoys.
I find it difficult to believe that after all the excellent publicity this program has generated locally and along the entire coast of Maine for the past eight years that UMM could not see a way to continue its financial and managerial support. During these years, I've seen carloads and busloads of elementary and high schoolers, as well as tour buses filled with state legislators, flock to Perio Point to visit the shellfish hatchery and talk with staff and UMM students about the goings on.
Given the obvious educational benefits to UMM and Maine's coastal communities, one has to think long and hard why, after eight years of positive associations and partnerships with the various communities, that faculty changes and budget constraints at UMM would force this kind of decision.
As the owner of the property the hatchery resides on, I also find it difficult that UMM's administration did not have the courtesy to notify my father or me prior to the decision or even acknowledged our cooperative arrangement during these past eight years. I think it was rather presumptuous of UMM's administration to seek a new administrator of the hatchery without consulting us. That's not the way we work together here in Down East Maine.
I'm sure the decision to discontinue operating the Regional Shellfish Hatchery is one that is cast in stone; however, it appears that UMM's administration, which publicizes the fact that the campus is "on the move," is moving in a dangerous and shortsighted direction. Albert C. Carver President, BIRSH Beals

Full text: Searsport
Searsport voters will fill three positions on the school board and one on the Board of Selectmen at the town election Tuesday.
The selectman's race pits incumbent Granville Gross against challenger Ronald Cook Sr. for a three-year term.
Three candidates are competing for two three-year openings on the SAD 56 board: incumbent Rhonda Bowden, Joan Farrar and Philip Millette. Dorothy Chocensky and Michael Hamilton are candidates for the remaining two years in the term of Glenn McFadden, who resigned from the board late last year. Chocensky was appointed to serve as an interim school director in January.
The ballot includes a referendum question on four proposed ordinances covering yard sales, the operation of junkyards and automobile salvage yards, cemetery fees and shellfish conservation.
The polls at the town office will be open from 10 a.m. until 8 p.m. Tuesday. The regular annual town meeting convenes at 9 a.m. Saturday, March 18, at the high school.
Athens
The annual town meeting in Athens will be held at 1:30 p.m. Saturday, March 11, at Athens Elemen- tary School.
Proposals included in this year's warrant drop the amount appropriated $20,000 from last year's figures. This should result in a small drop in the town's mill rate, according to town officials.
Issues to be dealt with Saturday include acceptance of a $75,000 grant to expand a town recreational park; a salary increase for the second and third selectmen's positions; and money to finish road work on the Dore Hill Road.
Charleston
The town will hold its annual election and town meeting at 10 a.m. Saturday, March 11, at the town hall.
Residents will elect two budget committee members, two recreation committee members, a selectman, a road commissioner and a fire chief, and will consider a 49-article warrant.
Articles include: appropriating $60,000 for plowing and sanding roads; $16,000 for maintenance of town ways; $59,669 for debt service; and $38,535.65 for solid waste management.
Voters will consider a request by residents of the Bacon and Fogg roads to appropriate $20,000 for rebuilding portions of the roads.
Garland
The debate over the 1994-1995 SAD 46 school budget doesn't appear to be over yet in Garland, with voters there Saturday to be asked if the town should hire legal help to find out if the school board acted legally this year.
The article states: "To see if the town will vote to authorize the selectmen to get a legal opinion on whether the SAD 46 board of directors acted beyond their legal authority in spending money in excess of the amount raised by voters of the member towns or act on anything relative, thereto, including legal action against individual members who so voted."
At issue appears to be the situation where voters approved a bottom-line budget for the year at one of six referendums, but did not approve local option money to fund the bottom line of the budget until six months into the budget.
Garland's annual town meeting, where this issue will be taken up, will start at 10 a.m. Saturday, March 11, at the grange hall.
In elections to be held that morning, Suzy Grant is running unopposed for town clerk; Steve Gudroe is unopposed for a three-year seat on the Board of Selectmen; Paul Robbins and Lawrence Folsom are seeking election to a one year term on the board of selectmen; Folsom is running unopposed for a three year term as assessor; and Ann Kucera and Arthur Jette are running for the three year opening on the SAD 46 board. Voters will elect a cemetery superintendent and a cemetery trustee.
Write-ins will be accepted at the meeting for any of these posts, but nominations from the floor will not, according to Suzy Grant, town clerk.
Newburgh
Both Newburgh seats on the SAD 22 board of directors will be filled during the annual town meeting at 10 a.m. Saturday, March 11, at Newburgh Elementary School on Route 9.
Leona Smith's term is expiring this month, and Stephen Johnson is vacating his term two years early because he is moving out of Newburgh.
Candidates for the two seats are Smith, Steve Whitcomb, Kurt Hoffman and Wendy Leuba.
Helen Mogan's term as first selectman is expiring, and she is the only candidate. Steve Eyles is the only candidate for the position of third selectman being vacated by Ron Darling.
Running for town clerk is Lois Libby, the incumbent, and for town treasurer, Lois Whitcomb, also incumbent.
The warrant for Saturday's meeting includes an amendment proposed by the planning board to the land use ordinance.
Voters are expected to consider acquiring a new firetruck.
Skowhegan
Skowhegan voters will go to the polls from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday to elect 15 officials. Elections will be held in the council room of the municipal building.
Voters will reconvene at 7 p.m. Monday, March 13, in the Skowhegan Opera House to conduct their annual town meeting.
Nine incumbent officials are not opposed in Saturday's elections. They are Selectman Donald Brough and Selectman David Summers, both for three-year terms; Selectman Lynda Quinn, two years, and Edward Conley Jr., current board chairman, also for two years.
Also unopposed are William Philbrick, for a five-year term as park commissioner, Rhonda Stark for town clerk and treasurer, and Gregory Dore for road commissioner.
In the selectman's race, incumbent Leonard Whitman is being challenged by Scott Nesbit and Michael Walker for a one-year term, and incumbent Walter Smith is opposed by Edward J. Conley as overseer of the poor.
Current SAD 54 directors Anne Gamage, Richard Irwin and Rupert White Jr. are opposed by June Washburn and John Forter for three open seats on the board of directors.

UMaine marine scientist offers advice on reviving clam industry Down East

Abstract: A research scientist from the University of Maine said Tuesday night that the lowly clam could become the economic backbone of the state's coastal communities if the natural marine resource was properly managed. Clam populations at Jonesport and other coastal towns could be brought back into production, but such a revitalization of the depleted industry would require "some hard work" by clam committees, businesspeople and others interested in the economic well-being of the Down East coastal region, [Brian] Beal said. His five practical methods of increasing clam production included: reseeding clam beds with wild or hatchery-reared clams; encouraging clam spat to attach itself to flats by installing low fences of either brush or plastic mesh netting; limiting the number of clams that can be taken from certain areas, in accordance with proper inventories of clam flat acreages; allowing more clams to spawn each year by closing specific clam beds from late May to mid-July during the spawning season; and creating "clam pounds" and using them as lobster pounds are used to stockpile product until the commercial market offers a profitable price.

Full text:   JONESPORT -- A research scientist from the University of Maine said Tuesday night that the lowly clam could become the economic backbone of the state's coastal communities if the natural marine resource was properly managed.
Brian Beal, assistant professor of marine ecology and the university's coordinator of environmental resources, told residents that "more people must take an active role in the industry in each coastal community."
No selectmen or members of the town's clam conservation committee attended the two-hour meeting sponsored by the local Literary Club.
Beal explained the clam's life cycle and gave an overview of the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery that he was instrumental in forming in 1987. Richard Carver of Beals donated a wharf and buildings to the pilot hatchery on Pero Point at Beals. The project originated from a Washington County 4-H Extension program in nearby Jonesboro.
Clam populations at Jonesport and other coastal towns could be brought back into production, but such a revitalization of the depleted industry would require "some hard work" by clam committees, businesspeople and others interested in the economic well-being of the Down East coastal region, Beal said.
His five practical methods of increasing clam production included: reseeding clam beds with wild or hatchery-reared clams; encouraging clam spat to attach itself to flats by installing low fences of either brush or plastic mesh netting; limiting the number of clams that can be taken from certain areas, in accordance with proper inventories of clam flat acreages; allowing more clams to spawn each year by closing specific clam beds from late May to mid-July during the spawning season; and creating "clam pounds" and using them as lobster pounds are used to stockpile product until the commercial market offers a profitable price.
The future of clamming "is a bright one for those interested enough in becoming involved," he said. "Residents of Jonesport and other coastal communities must remember that a healthy clamming industry means more jobs in the community, more income for the schools, the Fire Department and ambulance service, more money spent in the community at various stores and markets, more money in the local banks, and in general, greater prosperity within the entire community."
The hatchery's staff, in its effort to restore the industry, learned from its past trials and errors and is now valued by some communities as a major player in the statewide clam restoration program. While Beals Island (which has no clam conservation committee), Machiasport, Addison and Jonesport no longer participate in the hatchery program, communities outside Washington County do. Scarborough, Friendship, Waldoboro, Brunswick, Kittery and Swans Island are enthusiastic participants.
One of the newest proposals in clam flat management in the Down East area involves a portion of clam flats in Cutler. Paul Thompson of Cutler has received a research grant to develop a clam management demonstration. He wants the Cutler Clam Conservation Committee to lease a portion of "the desert" clam beds for his experimental plot. Final approval of the lease would come from the Department of Marine Resources.
Swans Island officials began that town's clam leasing program in 1992. The three 1/4-acre leases have been successful. One clam farmer sold clams in Bar Harbor for $120 a bushel. Beal said it has been legal for a town to lease up to 25 percent of its clam beds.
Jonesport has about 1,500 acres of clam beds. He proposed Tuesday that if the town set aside about 300 acres in the cove north of Flake Point Bar as a management area and produced a volume of clams equal to the cove's 1975 production of 150 bushels per acre, the cove would produce $1.5 million worth of marketable clams each year. He made no estimate of how much time would be needed to restore the bed to its 1975 production level.

Abstract: Representatives of the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery will meet with University of Maine at Machias President Paul Nordstrom on Wednesday to discuss the university's intent to cease its financial support of the hatchery. Dwayne Shaw, hatchery manager, and Dr. Brian Beal, UMM's hatchery consultant, will meet with Nordstrom to discuss how the university may assist BIRSH in seeking funds to keep the hatchery operating in support of the Down East clam industry. Because Beal, a professor of marine ecology at UMM, is seeking a new position within the university that does not include hatchery duties, university officials said Monday that UMM cannot afford the salary and operational funding required to replace him.

Full text:   MACHIAS -- Representatives of the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery will meet with University of Maine at Machias President Paul Nordstrom on Wednesday to discuss the university's intent to cease its financial support of the hatchery.
Dwayne Shaw, hatchery manager, and Dr. Brian Beal, UMM's hatchery consultant, will meet with Nordstrom to discuss how the university may assist BIRSH in seeking funds to keep the hatchery operating in support of the Down East clam industry.
The hatchery is widely known for its shellfish research and for seeding clam flats that had been overharvested for years. Once an economic mainstay involving more than 2,000 licensed clam diggers, the Down East clam harvest has plummeted in recent years. Fewer than 400 diggers hold licenses, and their harvest is down 90 percent.
Officials at UMM said late Monday that faculty changes and budget constraints at the campus in Machias would force BIRSH "to find new management and funding if it is to continue its operations."
Because Beal, a professor of marine ecology at UMM, is seeking a new position within the university that does not include hatchery duties, university officials said Monday that UMM cannot afford the salary and operational funding required to replace him.
Shaw said UMM may relinquish all bookkeeping responsibilities as early as Sept. 1.
The university doesn't own the hatchery and is not responsible for its operation and management. However, Beal, a native of Jonesport, has generated funding for the hatchery through grants and has been overseer of the hatchery's operations since BIRSH was formed eight years ago.
Beal's skill as a grant writer has garnered hundreds of thousands of federal, state and foundation dollars to cover research and operating costs. Grant funds have been the primary source of income for the hatchery. The annual operating cost of BIRSH is about $75,000.
An outgrowth of a Cooperative Extension project in Jonesboro, the hatchery is a cooperative venture. Beal has contributed time and expertise. UMM has contributed about $3,600 per year toward the cost of operations. Coastal communities have purchased baby clams to seed mud flats. Richard Carver of Beals has donated use of his wharf and buildings at Beals for the hatchery. And UMM work-study students contribute labor as do AmeriCorps youth.
In a press release Monday, Nordstrom said UMM -- in the present economic climate and in light of the faculty changes -- is unable to make a long-term commitment to fund the hatchery.
A proposed bill in the Legislature would provide $15,000 a year for a two-year period, but this would provide only a small part of what is needed.
Nordstrom said he was apprehensive about soliciting federal funds to operate a local enterprise, echoing Gov. Angus King's caution about relying on federal funds for jobs.
"University people value the hatchery and would like to see it continue, but we simply do not have the money to support its continued operation," said Nordstrom.
The present arrangement will continue until Sept. 1, he said, while pledging UMM's support as the hatchery seeks a new management organization. "Whoever assumes management of the hatchery can count on UMM experience and expertise," he said.

Full text:   The aquaculture business is a $45 million-a-year industry in Maine, and it is especially critical to the economic development of Washington County.
There are nearly 30 finfish farms in Maine; 16 of them are in Washington County, and the rest are in Hancock, Lincoln or Knox counties. There are 70 ocean-site leases containing 1,270 acres.
According to a fact sheet provided by the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center, there are several reasons the industry has been successful in Maine:
Availability of clean water inland, and in the ocean.
Diverse areas that vary environmentally and facilitate species diversification.
An existing infrastructure to handle permitting research, development and extension.
The willingness of the government and commercial fishermen to accept aquaculture.
The existence of a strong marine and seafood processing infrastructure.
Although aquaculture has experienced remarkable early growth, there have been constraints on the industry, such as the expense of complying with regulations issued by agencies with overlapping jurisdictions, and competition with relatively unregulated foreign competitors.
In some areas there has been a lack of public understanding of aquaculture's potential impact on the economy and opposition from riparian owners to new ocean lease sites. Finally, the industry has been hampered by limited access to investment capital.
Tom Duym, division head of the Washington County Technical College Marine Technology Center, describes himself as an academician, not a fish farmer, and said he did not like the term aquaculture.
"A lot of the guys are fishermen who turned into fish growers," he said. He equated the activity to agriculture and farmers who annually produce a crop.
Since salmon aquaculture began in Maine, the industry has provided participants with the highs and lows of a Ferris-wheel ride. When foreign competition drove market prices down, discussions about diversification began.
"Because of the intense marketing going on worldwide, the price which attracted many people to the industry in the beginning dropped down to a position of cost-plus. There isn't the profit margin there was when it first started," Duym said.
When the business began in New Brunswick in the 1980s, farmers got $6.50 a pound for a product whose cost of production was around $3.25 a pound. Today's farmers get around $3 a pound, and production costs remain high.
Many hope the aquaculture industry will fill the gap left by declining traditional fish stocks in the Gulf of Maine.
"Traditional stocks, flatfish: cod, haddock, pollack; other roundfish as well as other species are under severe stress, and the aquaculturist realizes there is a lot of potential. But also the aquaculturists tend to look at a species from its value standpoint. In other words, no matter which species you grow ... you must be able to grow a fish where its cost of production does not exceed what you can get for it at the market, and that is the bottom line," Duym said.
Halibut farming has generated interest because of the price it brings. Halibut steaks bring upward of $7 a pound. Duym said it was a difficult species to get through the culture process at the hatchery level, and it had a high mortality rate.
The Marine Trade Center was involved in a project with Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center in Orono to obtain halibut brood stock. The project was funded by MAIC and Northeast Regional Aquaculture Center in Massachusetts. The aim of the project, Duym said, was to strip eggs and sperm from mature female and male halibut and get fertilized eggs.
Mike Hastings, executive director of the MAIC, said scarce state dollars have hurt the project. "What we try to do now, because we have so little state money to devote to research, is to use it to leverage federal dollars and private foundation dollars," he said.
MAIC projects include development of a halibut brood stock parentage for future aquaculture; collection of cod as a brood stock for a cod hatchery; an experimental nori farm near Deer Isle; marine-species nutrition work; and the initial start-up grant for the nori farm in Eastport. "We have had almost 60 research projects over the past five years," Hastings said.
Research, Hastings said, was critical to the future of the industry. "We need more research specific to our ocean environment. You can have a species that has been cultivated in one part of the world ... but to grow the same species in Maine requires more research, because our temperatures and currents are different, and the composition of the bottom is different," he said.
Duym said he believed the future would include the farming of marine finfish, shellfish and urchins, as well as nori and other marine vegetables. He said there was a race on worldwide to see who could perfect a method to grow blue-fin tuna.
"The analogy often used is that traditional commercial fishermen were the last of the buffalo hunters. What we are seeing right now is the transition from the buffalo hunter to the cattle farmer," he said.

According to the local clam committee, the town's clam landings are originating in beds on the town's outer islands. Few clams are harvested from clam flats on the mainland because most of the industry's mainland acreage is closed because of pollution or conservation practices. The two large clam beds at Great Bar and Flakepoint Bar in the town's Mason Bay district are open to winter digging.

Full text:   JONESPORT -- A marine ecology professor from the University of Maine at Machias will discuss the future of Jonesport's clam industry next month at Peabody Memorial Library.
Brian Beal, assistant professor of marine ecology and the university's coordinator of environmental resources, will speak at 8 p.m. March 7 at Peabody Memorial Library.
A native of Jonesport, Beal has been asked by the local literary club to explain what practical measures should be taken to assure the future of the clam industry, which by 1993 had lost nearly two-thirds of its 1979 production level.
According to the local clam committee, the town's clam landings are originating in beds on the town's outer islands. Few clams are harvested from clam flats on the mainland because most of the industry's mainland acreage is closed because of pollution or conservation practices. The two large clam beds at Great Bar and Flakepoint Bar in the town's Mason Bay district are open to winter digging.
All of the town's waterfront on Moosabec Reach is off-limits to clamming because ocean water in the mollusks fails to meet minimum water quality standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The state Department of Marine Resources collects periodic water samples for tests performed at the DMR's laboratory in Lamoine. The DMR's enforcement branch closed the Moosabec Reach clam flats about six years ago.
E. coli bacteria, originating in failed septic systems and straight sewage discharge pipes, have polluted a significant amount of the town's estimated 1,800 acres of productive clam beds.
Members of the clam conservation committee, including Russell Batson and Lorenzo Wallace Jr., said Thursday that all of the town's outer islands were free of pollution and were open to harvesting by Jonesport's 44 licensed diggers. A resident commercial clam license at Jonesport costs $25, in addition to a required one-year state clam license costing $63.
Diggers are receiving $48 a bushel. Batson said his discussions with area clammers has convinced him that clam populations are beginning to show signs of revival.
Last summer, when clam prices reached $90 a bushel, some diggers in the Jonesport-Beals region were earning about $200 for three hours of digging. Arthur Alley of Jonesport said his daily production matched other high-producing flats anywhere in the state. Alley said he was convinced that natural regeneration was occurring.
Arpie Alley of Jonesport, a veteran clam digger and former warden for the local clam committee, also said the best way to revive the clam industry was to follow the proven policy of old-time clam diggers, who favored closing a large area of clam flats from May through September to permit clam spawn to repopulate.
Jonesport has no reciprocal digging rights with any other community, but recently joined the Down East Regional Shellfish Committee with neighboring towns Addison and Harrington. Committee members share ideas on how to manage and improve their clam flats. About 4,000 acres of clam beds in the three towns are expected to benefit from the regional meetings.

Full text: BRUNSWICK -- Having to work in a soup kitchen, a church or a public library isn't as tough as paying $300 for digging clams without a license or in a closed area, say shellfish officials here.
That's why they convinced freshman Rep. Tom Davidson, D-Brunswick, to propose a bill that would restrict the punishment for shellfish violations to monetary fines.
"I thought that if, in fact, we're going to close these places off, we have to have enforcement that's much stronger than it is now," said Davidson.
It's not known how often shellfish violators work off their fines with community service. The West Bath District Court clerk's office keeps track of the fines, but not whether the fines were paid with labor or cash.
"I don't know where they're doing their community service, if they're doing it. They could be putting their grandmother's windows in," said Jim MacLeod, chairman of the town's marine resources committee.
He thinks that poachers can easily pay the minimum $300 fine for the first offense.
"They're probably standing there with $200 to $300 in their pocket, said MacLeod. "I think the judges are being duped."
Judge Joseph Field, who hands down community service sentences in West Bath District Court, said he had no public opinion on the proposed legislation.
Field said he turned to community service sentences during the recession when people coming to court could not afford hundreds of dollars in fines for various violations.
"People don't realize how high some of these numbers are in terms of people's lives," he said.
In most cases, people would rather pay the fine than be faced with the work or jail time, he said.
"I may be being hoodwinked. They may have bags of money, but frankly most folks with bags of money are going to be willing to shell out some of it to avoid community service."

Full text: AUGUSTA -- Journalist Robin Alden moved closer to managing the waterfront, instead of covering it, when she received the ringing endorsement Thursday of a legislative committee to be the next commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
After hearing strong support from virtually every sector of the fishing industry, The Joint Standing Committee on Marine Resources unanimously recommend- ed the confirmation of Gov. Angus King's nominee for the state's top fisheries post.
If confirmed as expected by the full Senate within a few days, the Stonington publisher will become the first woman to govern Maine's fishing industry.
Alden, 43, founded what is now the Commercial Fisheries News in 1973, and since has started two other fisheries publications. She also has worked for the University of Maine Sea Grant program, helped organize the Maine Fishermen's Forum, now in its 20th year, and served on the New England Fishery Management Council.
The long line of speakers supporting the nominee at Thursday's hearing included many individual fishermen and representatives of such organizations as the Maine Lobstermen's Association, the Downeast Lobstermen's Association, the Maine Sardine Council, the Maine Aquaculture Association, the Maine Seaweed Council, the Maine Fishermen's Wives Association, the Portland Fish Exchange, the Island Institute, the Maine Urchin Harvester's Association, the Maine Science and Technology Foundation and the Coastal Conservation Association for recreational saltwater anglers.
Supporters praised Alden's comprehensive knowledge of all aspects of the fishing industry and marine science, as well as her editorial positions favoring increased input from fish- ermen in the development of fishing regulations and her reputation as one who builds bridges between competing groups.
Brian Beal, a shellfish scientist at the University of Maine at Machias, called Alden's nomination "one of the most sensible appointments in the history of the state. She is an eloquent speaker and a master of listening."
After listening to dozens of favorable comments during the two and one-half hour session, the legislators heard from one opponent, Augusta environmentalist Bob Lavangie. He criticized the lack of coverage in the fishery press of estuary pollution and Alden's connection through marriage to the gillnetting industry, which he called "a cruel fishery."
In her statement to the committee, Alden said she will continue as commissioner "to be a consensus-builder, to find in the diversity of opinion the underlying principles, to keep everyone at the table."
Rep. Herbert Adams, D-Portland, asked Alden how she will balance the need for fishermen to earn a living with the need to conserve and restore the resource. She said her position that "those who fish should help make the rules is based on my belief that the people who know the most about the behavior and abundance of fish are those who catch them. Anyone can make rules. We need rules that really work and people who are involved in making the rules will take responsibility for them."
Acknowledging her lack of experience in law enforcement, Alden said she will work closely with the Marine Patrol, adding that fishermen are the most ardent supporters of enforcement, if the regulations are fair and rational.
In response to questions from other committee members, Alden said she supports Maine becoming a leader in marine science, favors closers ties between traditional fishing and aquaculture, and promised that Maine will make strenuous objections should the federal government move ahead with plans to declare Atlantic salmon an endangered species, a development many fear would kill the Downeast finfish aquaculture industry.

Local clammers eye success story Down East industry studies Brunswick setup

Abstract: Clam committees from three towns in Washington County learned this week that Brunswick's successful $2 million clam industry and Down East Maine share a common goal: to keep marine worm diggers out of closed clam beds. Alan Huston, a spokesman for the Brunswick Clam Conservation Committee, told the Down East Regional Shellfish Committee Monday night at Addison that his committee was pushing a bill that would prevent worm diggers and clam diggers from working in closed clam beds. He described the intrusion of worm diggers into closed clam areas as "a big problem." Huston, who attended the Down East committee's public meeting to explain how the city of Brunswick has built a $2 million clam industry in 19 years, said the legislation, sponsored by Rep.

A legislative docket number is expected to be assigned to the bill within the next few days.

Full text: ADDISON -- Clam committees from three towns in Washington County learned this week that Brunswick's successful $2 million clam industry and Down East Maine share a common goal: to keep marine worm diggers out of closed clam beds.
Alan Huston, a spokesman for the Brunswick Clam Conservation Committee, told the Down East Regional Shellfish Committee Monday night at Addison that his committee was pushing a bill that would prevent worm diggers and clam diggers from working in closed clam beds. He described the intrusion of worm diggers into closed clam areas as "a big problem."
Huston, who attended the Down East committee's public meeting to explain how the city of Brunswick has built a $2 million clam industry in 19 years, said the legislation, sponsored by Rep. Tom Davidson of Brunswick, would protect soft-shell clams from being broken by fishermen's boots in closed clam beds. The city has 427.5 acres of productive clam flats. A legislative docket number is expected to be assigned to the bill within the next few days.
If a clam bed is closed for regeneration, including reseeding, commercial worm diggers are allowed to walk through the mud flats in search of sandworms or bloodworms. Worms for sport fishermen are in demand year round on many markets including those in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.
Huston said clams should be given a legislative priority over worms because clams are for human consumption, but he expects wormers to oppose the proposed law that for the first time would restrict them. The worm industry had its beginning Down East in the mid-1950s. Earlier, Wiscasset was one of the first communities to develop a worm industry.
Albion Kenney, Harrington's clam warden, said the clam industry's closed areas need the long overdue protection.
Representatives from the Jonesport, Addison and Harrington clam committees were told that Brunswick had worked for 19 years to build up the city's clam industry. A total of 33,208 bushels of clams are expected to be harvested this year from a record 427.5 acres of clam beds.
He said the city's marine clam committee operates on a $78,000 budget, about $23,000 of which is raised through clam licenses and other revenue.
Although Brunswick's clam acreage is up this year by 32 acres, through reseeding programs, the 1995 harvest is estimated to be down by about 3,000 bushels from 1994, down by 2,000 bushels from 1993.
The decline estimated for this year in nine of the city's 16 clam beds may be compensated for by reducing the number of available clam licenses. The city has 99 commercial diggers who are allowed to harvest open beds night or day. Some consideration would be given to eliminating nighttime harvesting, he said.
One of the community's outstanding success stories expected this year should be in Smith's Cove, where 260 bushels were harvested in 1994. This year, the cove's flats are expected to yield 1,623 bushels. The spectacular growth in productivity was attributed to flexible management of the flats, including periodic closures allowing clams to spawn and grow to the minimum 2-inch commercial size.
Brunswick, 173 miles south of Machias, has the advantage of ocean water that is somewhat warmer than that which covers clam beds at Jonesport, Harrington and Addison. Clams grow faster in nutrient-rich warmer water, he said.
Brunswick's clams also have been aided by planting hatchery-raised seedlings. Some of the seed has been purchased from the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery at Beals.
Harvests timed to match market demands and higher summertime market prices have enhanced the incomes of Brunswick's clammers, some of whom earned $50,000 to $60,000 last year, Huston said. One digger earned about $70,000 during the 280-day season.
Walter Schafer of Harrington, co-chairman of the Down East committee that seeks to bring the three communities together to share ideas and methods of improving clam-flat production, said Monday that he was "convinced that what they do down there (in Brunswick) we can do up here."
Others from the three towns said that if a significant percent of clam-flat acreage were closed from May to September, production would increase.

Full text:   PORTLAND -- Efforts to preserve the Gulf of Maine got a $1.9 million boost from federal environmental regulators on Monday.
The grant from the Environmental Protection Agency is intended to support work by the Gulf of Maine Council over the next decade on habitat protection, water quality monitoring and research, public outreach and polluton abatement and prevention.
The Gulf of Maine stretches from Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, to Cape Cod, Mass., and includes the Georges Bank and the Bay of Fundy.
"The gulf is important to millions of people in this region, both as a recreational and an economic resource," said John P. DeVillars, regional EPA administrator for New England.
"Those of us at EPA would not be doing our job if we didn't provide the financial and technical support necessary to protect and improve this truly amazing ecosystem," he said.
Fishing and shellfishing have been major industries in the gulf, sustaining the work of nearly 20,000 fishermen and contributing hundreds of millions of dollars to the region's economy in recent years.
Also, the gulf's coastline draws millions of visitors each year and is a major contributor to the region's economy.
The Gulf of Maine Council includes representatives from Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Its mission is to maintain and improve the gulf's environmental quality while allowing people to use its resources.
The Association of U.S. Delegates of the Gulf of Maine, a non-profit organization, will carry out the project's day-to-day work and administer the grant.
All four members of Maine's congressional delegation praised the EPA grant.
"Maine and the other states and provinces bordering the gulf have adopted a regional approach to protecting their common natural and economic heritage," said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.

Abstract: Despite the protests of the victim's family and Vermont's Department of Corrections, the Vermont Parole Board this week granted a murderer his freedom, as long as he lives somewhere else. Like Lincolnville, Maine. By a vote of 3-2 on Tuesday, the Vermont board granted parole to Ray (Butch) Rebideau, provided he is accepted by authorities in Maine, where he served five of his 22 years in prison, or, as a second choice, Washington state, where family members live. Corrections officials from Vermont and Maine are expected to take about 45 days to evaluate Rebideau's request to move to Lincolnville, where he has been offered a full-time job and temporary housing by David Aho, owner of a shellfish company. Aho met Rebideau at the Warren prison farm where he was a volunteer working with inmates.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Despite the protests of the victim's family and Vermont's Department of Corrections, the Vermont Parole Board this week granted a murderer his freedom, as long as he lives somewhere else. Like Lincolnville, Maine.
By a vote of 3-2 on Tuesday, the Vermont board granted parole to Ray (Butch) Rebideau, provided he is accepted by authorities in Maine, where he served five of his 22 years in prison, or, as a second choice, Washington state, where family members live.
Corrections officials from Vermont and Maine are expected to take about 45 days to evaluate Rebideau's request to move to Lincolnville, where he has been offered a full-time job and temporary housing by David Aho, owner of a shellfish company. Aho met Rebideau at the Warren prison farm where he was a volunteer working with inmates.
Rebideau, 46, was convicted of first-degree murder in 1973 for the shooting a year earlier of Raymond Lestage in Royalton, a crime considered at the time to be one of Vermont's most brutal.
Lestage, visiting the Burlington area from Massachusetts, accepted a ride from Rebideau and two other men the night of Aug. 13, 1972. He was found shot to death in a cemetery the next morning.
Rebideau and the other gunman, Frank Berard Jr., were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. The third man was convicted of being an accessory to the crime.
Rebideau was transferred to the Maine prison system five years ago in an attempt to resolve discipline problems that arose from having him and Berard incarcerated in the same Vermont facility. Rebideau's conduct apparently improved considerably in Maine, as he earned his way into the minimum-security prison farm at Warren, completed many college courses toward a future as a substance-abuse counselor and received glowing reports on his progress in anger-management classes.
He was first granted parole in December 1993 for residency in Washington state, but the Vermont board rescinded that action after a furor arose over the failure to notify Lestage's family and a fearful eyewitness of his pending release. Rebideau reapplied for parole last fall and was transferred back to Vermont in December.
Several members of Lestage's family attended the hearing Tuesday, unsuccessfully urging the board to accept the recommendation of the Vermont Department of Corrections that Rebideau be denied parole because of insufficient progress in the state's programs for violent offenders.
After the 3-2 vote to grant parole, one member of the victim's family was quoted by The Associated Press as saying Rebideau's "future and freedom became paramount to the parole board, while the reality of a heinous, brutal killing seemed to be forgotten."
Parole Board Chairwoman Alice Hafner, who voted against Rebideau's release, said Thursday she was troubled by a decision that disregarded the recommendations of her state's corrections officials and that asks the states of Maine or Washington to do something Vermont is not willing to do.
"Mr. Rebideau's parole is contingent upon his being accepted in Maine or Washington. He will remain incarcerated as long as he is in Vermont," Hafner said. "Maine was the first choice in the parole plan he presented, so it's now up to Maine to investigate and to decide whether to take him or not. While Vermont corrections said he needs more programming, what we heard from Maine, in favorable corrections reports and the testimony of a psychologist, was that he had been through enough programs and should be paroled. I can't say why the majority of our board put more emphasis on reports from Maine than on reports from our own state."
Peter Tilton, director of Maine's Division of Probation and Parole, said Friday the decision to accept or reject Rebideau "most definitely is our choice. These requests are not at all uncommon, but they are all investigated thoroughly. Once Vermont sends the information on this man's parole plan, we will evaluate the reasons behind it, any family ties, the living conditions, the employment opportunities, our ability to supervise and monitor." Tilton said the sentiment of the community and local police on accepting the parolee "is, to a certain extent, taken into account."
The reason Maine would even consider taking a parolee from another state, Tilton said, "is the Uniform Interstate Compact. Every state in the country has signed on to an agreement to allow people released from incarceration to transfer to other states. This is a very mobile society, with hundreds of thousands of people released from prison. We consider taking people from other states because other states reciprocate by taking ours. Without the compact, parolees could just go anywhere at any time, with no supervision or control. There have been occasions, not by Vermont, of states dumping violent offenders on other states. The compact is our protection against that."
Tilton said Maine now is home to about 20 convicted murderers released from other states. "What's interesting is that that is exactly the same number as we have sent to other states through the compact," he said. "Our imports and exports are balanced. In contrast, other states, like Florida, have many more coming in than leaving."
Aho said Friday he is willing to open his Lincolnville home and business to Rebideau because he is convinced the convict deserves a second chance.
"I met Ray through my volunteer work with inmates at the Warren prison farm, and from our first meeting, he has always come across as a sincere person who has worked hard to turn his life around," Aho said. "I'm a good judge of character. This is not a rash decision. I've put a lot of research into this. I've been working closely with his abuse counselor. I've gained a lot of insight into his situation. He's done his time, almost 23 years in prison, since he was a young man. I think it would be an injustice to keep him in after he's done so much to help himself."

Abstract: If you want to hear a culinary horror story, engage someone who's been to college on the topic of cafeteria food. The resulting spew of culinary gore -- or culinary gaffe -- will rival Jason's machete-wielding antics in the latest "Friday the 13th" sequel. Fear no more, stomachs that have suffered the grease and grit of mystery meat and overcooked vegetables. Husson College, a 1,200-student campus in Bangor, can provide definite relief from cafeteria anxiety. The staff of the college's dining service runs a program that's "one of the best in the business," according to a national group that monitors college food. Husson ranked with the University of Pennsylvania, Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, Kansas State University and Ashland University in Ohio for its superior food and high-quality dining service, according to an article titled "The Best in the Business," in a national marketing newsletter put out by the Michigan-based National Association of College and University Food Services.

Full text:   If you want to hear a culinary horror story, engage someone who's been to college on the topic of cafeteria food. The resulting spew of culinary gore -- or culinary gaffe -- will rival Jason's machete-wielding antics in the latest "Friday the 13th" sequel.
One Bangor woman recalled a frosted cupcake, complete with cigarette butt, gracing her food tray during a memorable meal on a Massachusetts campus.
A local chef recalled pulling a round hairball -- not just one piece of hair -- from an otherwise tempting bowl of minnestrone soup one chilly day when he was a college freshman in Maine.
Fear no more, stomachs that have suffered the grease and grit of mystery meat and overcooked vegetables. Husson College, a 1,200-student campus in Bangor, can provide definite relief from cafeteria anxiety. The staff of the college's dining service runs a program that's "one of the best in the business," according to a national group that monitors college food.
Husson ranked with the University of Pennsylvania, Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, Kansas State University and Ashland University in Ohio for its superior food and high-quality dining service, according to an article titled "The Best in the Business," in a national marketing newsletter put out by the Michigan-based National Association of College and University Food Services.
The newsletter is sent to more than 6,000 senior college officials nationwide. Husson Food Services was praised for being a "magnet for a variety of socially significant events."
Mixing culinary excellence with a true desire to serve, Mike San Antonio, Husson dining services director, has helped his program evolve into a key attraction for recruiting students to the central Maine campus.
It's "kind of a shock" to receive national recognition for a good job done every day, he said. The Husson Food Service Program "is a story waiting to be told," said San Antonio, who credited the enthusiasm and skill of his staff with making the program work.
On any given day, Husson students can sample entrees from the perenially popular baked turkey with cornbread stuffing to an occasional Shrimp Etouffee, which is an elaborate Cajun dish that includes three different kinds of pepper to bring out varied tastes.
A deli bar featuring cheese, meats and sandwich fixings stands beside a 33-item salad bar offering traditional fare for diners who want simpler meals, but San Antonio is most proud of the innovative dishes concocted by staff that offer high-quality taste and variety.
Spicy Peanut Chicken, a surprisingly delicious combination of vegetables, peanuts and fresh, tender chicken, will be one of the centerpiece entrees of the cafeteria's supper celebration of Chinese New Year Wednesday, Feb. 1. About 15 different dishes will be served at the event, part of the dining service's "Taste of the World" series.
San Antonio, who collects cookbooks in his spare time, may plan a breakfast for hundreds of local businessmen and women, while consulting with his chefs about an innovative meal to serve more than 600 students who will dine at Dickerman Dining Commons that evening.
In the past six months, Husson has served as host to a gubernatorial debate, which was televised from the dining commons, and a three-day Maine Senior Olympics event in September.
Mixing large-scale catering with the daily routine of feeding hundreds of students three times a day may seem daunting, but San Antonio says anything is possible with an enthusiastic attitude and a true desire to serve.
Dining service staff work hard to instill a family atmosphere in the dining room. From breakfast through lunch and dinner, "we want students to feel at home here," San Antonio said.
Formal dinners are put on by the dining staff once or twice a semester to acquaint students destined for heady business heights about the proper use of salad forks and soup spoons.
About once a month, the cafeteria puts on an installment of its "Taste of America" or "Taste of the World" series. On these days, the menu will feature food from various parts of the country, or various parts of the world.
Last October, the cafeteria threw a culinary bash to observe the German Oktoberfest rite. It also offered fare to mark mid-winter Mardi Gras in New Orleans.
The following recipes are samples of the fare to be served at Husson's Chinese New Year observance.

The sea coots had the last word on the final day of hunting

Abstract: Dawn was a smudge of drizzle and fog that touched our faces with flannelly fingers as Rick Levasseur, my son, Jeff, and I rigged "coot" tollers on a tide-exposed point in Trenton Narrows. "If I were a coot I wouldn't want to fly in this weather," said Rick, a NEWS assignment editor recently inducted as a full-fledged member of the camouflage clan. The word "coot," you may know, is a colloquialism for the white-winged scoter, a large sea duck. As we moved our gear back from the flooding tide, a glance at my watch showed 10 minutes till gunning time. During that hurry-up-and-wait interim, several more squadrons of coots winged by in tight formation without giving our invitation a nod of acknowledgment. So murky was the fog and drizzle that the coots' white wing patches, which usually flash brilliantly against their overall black-plumage, were barely visible.

Full text: Dawn was a smudge of drizzle and fog that touched our faces with flannelly fingers as Rick Levasseur, my son, Jeff, and I rigged "coot" tollers on a tide-exposed point in Trenton Narrows.
"If I were a coot I wouldn't want to fly in this weather," said Rick, a NEWS assignment editor recently inducted as a full-fledged member of the camouflage clan. The word "coot," you may know, is a colloquialism for the white-winged scoter, a large sea duck.
"They'll fly," Jeff replied as he hooked a toller to the line anchored off the point and extending back to it. "But the question is whether or not they'll toll."
"Don't bait fate," I admonished my oldest offspring while handing him the last of the big, cork-bodied tollers. As though on cue, my words were punctuated by Rick's exclamation: "Look!"
A duck hunter needs no more direction than that. Instinctively, Jeff and I stood statue-still and cut our eyes toward the tollers.
Like winged shadows emerging from the shrouding fog, a dozen or so coots flew by without dipping a wing our way. "Damn," I thought, "I don't like the looks of that." I liked it even less when, seconds later, another silhouetted flock paid no attention to what the late Owen Osborne - a former NEWS sports editor and avid waterfowler - would have called "our Charlie McCarthy ducks."
As we moved our gear back from the flooding tide, a glance at my watch showed 10 minutes till gunning time. During that hurry-up-and-wait interim, several more squadrons of coots winged by in tight formation without giving our invitation a nod of acknowledgment. So murky was the fog and drizzle that the coots' white wing patches, which usually flash brilliantly against their overall black-plumage, were barely visible.
"Either they can't see us or they're just teasing us," Rick allowed. "Can you call them?" he asked, referring to my calling mallards and black ducks during the regular duck season.
"Coots don't actually call," I explained. "The drakes grunt a little, but that's about it. Don't worry, they see the tollers, they're just not responding to them."
"Why not?" Obviously, Rick's trigger finger was itchy.
"Some days they do, some days they don't," I answered.
"They sure did the last time I was here," said Jeff, who was restraining his young Labrador retriever, appropriately named "Coot," from charging into the water at each passing flock. "They came in like they were crashing a party."
Daylight amounted to no more than dawn grown gray. Steadily, the flooding tide boosted by a south wind flowed onto the point, forcing us to retreat with the tollers in tow. Actually, conditions couldn't have been better. Only the coots were uncooperative.
But it mattered not. The beauty of a coastal dawn, regardless of season or weather, never fails to provide me with a limit bag of artistic inspiration and spiritual fulfillment. Nowhere else does nature display its masterful works and wondrous order more clearly or dramatically than where the land rises from the sea.
While, minute by minute, the restless tide changed the character of the coastline, we watched the fog thickening and thinning. Rising from the ruffled gray water, it drifted ghost-like through spruce-spired headlands standing like ancient castles.
Flocks of old squaws recited their rhythmical chants as, like flung darts, they flew swift and straight. A string of black ducks wavered high above the opposite shore. Higher, still, an eagle soared and the chiming wingbeats of whistlers betrayed their unseen flight. Rockefeller couldn't have bought it, yet it didn't cost us a nickel.
When a fishing boat chugged through the narrows we anticipated a flurry of shooting. But the only ducks the boat disturbed was a string of mergansers that swept past us in single file. Shortly thereafter, perhaps realizing that if he were to fetch anything he'd have to do it on his own, Coot swam out and started a tug of war with a mooring buoy. Needless to say, the buoy won.
By midmorning the tide had shoved us back to where garlands of rockweed rimmed the shore. Save for a few scattered singles and pairs, the morning flights had ended. That is, of course, until we started taking up the tollers. Directly, five coots swung toward us, set their wings and then flared away. "See?" Rick reminded, "I told you they were just teasing us."
Simply put, the coots won on that last day of the sea-duck hunting season, but we were far from being skunked. Before leaving, nature again provided an opportunity to see, if not feel, the pulse of Planet Earth. While wading and unhooking decoys, we noticed streams of bubbles rising from the bottom for as far as we could see.
The point we were on was strewn with mussel beds, and as the tide covered them, the bivalve mollusks began feeding by pumping and filtering water, hence the bubbles. Think of streams of bubbles rising in a potful of simmering water, multiply it by hundreds, and you've got the picture.
After a somewhat soggy tailgate party of coffee and raisin-bran muffins, we loaded our gear and Coot into the capped pickup and departed. Admittedly, there was a degree of satisfaction in knowing that, for a year or so, we wouldn't have to worry about winds and tides and rigging tollers on the point, while wondering, of course, if the coots would toll.
Some days they do, some days they don't. It really doesn't matter.

High temps turning ice treacherous

Abstract: Most outdoors-oriented people know that moving water freezes slowly and usually less than solid, if at all. In fact, around these parts that principle often is applied to avoiding frozen water pipes by allowing faucets to trickle during periods of sub-zero cold. With that in mind, consider the amount of water now flowing into and onto lakes and ponds as brooks, bogs, rivers, and streams spill their burdens of rain and snow melt. The message is clear: the solderings of ice sealing bodies of water are corroding quickly and will continue to do so until the spates and warm weather subside. Mother Nature has a full bag of tricks with which to deteriorate ice in a hurry and, currently, she is putting them all to good use. You probably know the weight of water on ice forces it downward, causing it to become weakened by submersion. But do you know that the weight of 1 inch of water covering an acre of ice translates to about 113 tons? And so you won't think that seemingly outlandish figure is an exaggeration of the kind commonly attributed to fishermen, understand that it was provided by Wes Hallowell, a river engineer at the Kennebec Water Power Co. in Waterville. Again, what we have now is a flushing action of excess water that will weaken ice conditions significantly. Surely, you've seen how quickly water whirlpooling into your ice-fishing holes widens those openings in only a few hours. Consider, then, that as you read this the same kind of action is occurring in every break, crack, crevice, and pressure ridge wrinkling the ice of Maine's inland waters. Also, keep in mind that as swollen tributary waters subside, lakes and ponds will drop accordingly, causing more breaks in ice fields.

Full text: Without question, the recent serving of soft weather spells trouble for sportsmen. In this scenario, however, trouble can be spelled I-C-E. The frozen pavements of lakes and ponds were treacherous enough before the "January thaw" set in, but now, after the dissolving effects of rain, drizzle, fog, and spring-like temperatures, ice conditions could be described as totally untrustworthy.
Most outdoors-oriented people know that moving water freezes slowly and usually less than solid, if at all. In fact, around these parts that principle often is applied to avoiding frozen water pipes by allowing faucets to trickle during periods of sub-zero cold. With that in mind, consider the amount of water now flowing into and onto lakes and ponds as brooks, bogs, rivers, and streams spill their burdens of rain and snow melt. The message is clear: the solderings of ice sealing bodies of water are corroding quickly and will continue to do so until the spates and warm weather subside.
That, of course, increases the always-present dangers of water moving at inlets and outlets, around spring holes and in lakes that have currents. Such lakes usually are flowages created by dams. Include the influences of winds and you have to agree that, at the moment, it will make sense to postpone your ice fishing plans and, perhaps, tie a few more flies.
Mother Nature has a full bag of tricks with which to deteriorate ice in a hurry and, currently, she is putting them all to good use. You probably know the weight of water on ice forces it downward, causing it to become weakened by submersion. But do you know that the weight of 1 inch of water covering an acre of ice translates to about 113 tons? And so you won't think that seemingly outlandish figure is an exaggeration of the kind commonly attributed to fishermen, understand that it was provided by Wes Hallowell, a river engineer at the Kennebec Water Power Co. in Waterville.
Again, what we have now is a flushing action of excess water that will weaken ice conditions significantly. Surely, you've seen how quickly water whirlpooling into your ice-fishing holes widens those openings in only a few hours. Consider, then, that as you read this the same kind of action is occurring in every break, crack, crevice, and pressure ridge wrinkling the ice of Maine's inland waters. Also, keep in mind that as swollen tributary waters subside, lakes and ponds will drop accordingly, causing more breaks in ice fields.
Last, but by no means least, snow cover on lakes and ponds was, for the most part, removed by the recent thaw. The result is that, in some places, sunlight will penetrate ice and actually warm the surface water directly beneath it. This causes the undersurface of the ice to honeycomb and contribute to the corrosion of ice that may have been solid a few days ago.
Several lakes on Mount Desert Island are mostly clear of ice, reports fisheries technician Greg Burr, who works for the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Echo and Eagle lakes are both clear of ice, Burr says, adding that Long Pond is practically open.
Tunk Lake of Township 10, which is between Franklin and Cherryfield, also has a large portion of open water, Burr said, adding that people were fishing on the lake on Saturday.
Even when January's traditionally frigid weather returns to make new ice, sportsmen should use caution when venturing onto frozen water. For sure, there'll be layers of water, slush, and snow-ice that will make traveling difficult and dangerous, to say the least. If you've left tracks in this neck of the woods for any length of time, you know there's plenty of winter left. Be patient, your ice-fishing shack isn't going anywhere and, besides, right about now there's probably about a foot or so of water in it.
Here's one you won't want to miss: come Jan. 22, 11:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m., the Hungry Hollow 76'ers Snowmobile Club will hold its annual Stew and Chowder Day at the clubhouse on Horseback Road in Levant. The public is invited to partake of an impressive menu featuring Al's Sensational Seafood Chowder, $5; Dawn's Best Beef Stew, $3.50; Dot's Awesome Oyster Stew, $5; Millie's Creamy Corn Chowder, $2.50. Biscuits, beverages, pickles, and crackers will be served with all of the above and the grill will be open if you prefer to order a hamburger or hot dog.
Frankly, after salivating over the aforementioned menu, I can't imagine opting for the latter - that would be like drinking beer when there's bourbon on the bar. Seeing as there's no snow to run your sled on and no football games on television, the 76'ers Stew and Chowder Day sounds like a great place to be on Sunday.
Thanks to wildlife biologist Brad Allen's recommendation, Maine's wild turkey hunters will have a chance to bag 250 more permits for this spring's May 1-29 spring hunt. Basing its decision on management data regarding Maine's expanding population of wild turkeys, the state's Fish and Wildlife Advisory Council recently voted to increase the number of permits from 500 to 750.
Applications for turkey-hunting permits are now available at hunting and fishing license agents statewide. The deadline for submitting applications is Feb. 1. Application forms will be mailed to hunters who participated in last year's turkey hunt.

Abstract: With fewer fin fish preying on lobsters, which may account in part for the current success of lobster fishermen, a Jonesport native is proposing to build a new lobster pound capable of holding about 80,000 pounds of lobster at Hopkins Point this spring. If the commercial project is approved, the [Charles "Buster" Huntley Jr.] pound would be the third man-made lobster enclosure on the north side of Moosabec Reach. There are about eight working lobster pounds on Beals Island, including two on Moosabec Reach. At a preapplication meeting with several agency representatives last week at Jonesport, Huntley and his consultants, Robert Costa of Perry and Bruce Colbeth of Beals, said the new holding facility would add to the 850,000 pounds of lobster stored each winter in the Jonesport-Beals area. Colbeth said the new pound would create another opportunity for fishermen to market the natural resource.

Full text: JONESPORT -- With fewer fin fish preying on lobsters, which may account in part for the current success of lobster fishermen, a Jonesport native is proposing to build a new lobster pound capable of holding about 80,000 pounds of lobster at Hopkins Point this spring.
Charles "Buster" Huntley Jr. wants to build a $150,000 lobster holding facility on his property facing Moosabec Reach over an estimated three-month period beginning March 1, if he secures the required permits from state and federal agencies.
With approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of Marine Resources, Huntley would open his pound on July 1 within the town's approved maritime district.
David Killoy, a spokesman for the Corps of Engineers in Boston, said Monday that if he receives the Jonesport businessman's final permit application by the end of the year, Huntley could receive a decision by March 1. A 30-day public information and comment period would precede a one-month examination of the project by state and federal agencies.
If the commercial project is approved, the Huntley pound would be the third man-made lobster enclosure on the north side of Moosabec Reach. There are about eight working lobster pounds on Beals Island, including two on Moosabec Reach.
The project would use about 3 acres of a small cove on the shoreline a few feet south of Huntley's home. The L-shaped berm that would be erected to confine the lobsters would extend from Hopkins Point east about 300 feet. The design plan includes a long ledge as part of the overall retaining wall.
The berm would consist of gravel-filled sheet steel pilings about 17 feet tall, leaving bout 4 feet of its rocky top exposed at high tide. Moosabec Reach often has 12-foot tides.
Heavy stone riprap would protect the pound from eroding into Moosabec Reach. "One way to build it is the safe way," Huntley said. "When you have a lot of money invested in something, you want that investment to stand up. A 60-mile breeze is common here during the winter."
A native of Hopkins Point, he said he was very familiar with local storms, ice action and other conditions that would have an impact on the berm.
Other features of the pound would include a 2-foot-deep, water-filled trench dug along the inside edge of the berm. The trench is needed to prevent lobsters from crawling out of their enclosure. A single gate at the east end of the facility would enable it to be drained annually for cleaning and possibly harvesting of shellfish with approval of the Department of Marine Resources.
At a preapplication meeting with several agency representatives last week at Jonesport, Huntley and his consultants, Robert Costa of Perry and Bruce Colbeth of Beals, said the new holding facility would add to the 850,000 pounds of lobster stored each winter in the Jonesport-Beals area. Colbeth said the new pound would create another opportunity for fishermen to market the natural resource.
"For fall fishermen, pounds are the super value part of the industry," he said. "Without pounds, fishermen are at the mercy of the open market." A petition signed by 155 Jonesport area residents was presented in support of Huntley's project.
Colbeth explained why Down East lobster fishermen are landing about 75 percent of the state's total lobster catch, and why the lobster industry as a whole is having a growth year that may include a new production record.
"The groundfish are being caught up. The groundfish eat small lobsters," he said. "That's why we are now catching more lobsters. This industry is not suffering as other areas of the fishing industry are."
Poundkeepers fill their pounds from early September until mid-February. Few lobsters are caught from February until March. The facility would provide protection for softshell lobsters against natural predators.
Colbeth said Huntley was seeking permission to build a new pound because recent efforts to purchase the Flying Place lobster pound at Beals were unsuccessful. The facility, formerly owned by Edmund Alley, has been idle for about 20 years.
"I've been after it two years ... but the cost is too high," Colbeth said.

Full text: It's the event of the year.
Grandmother Thompson's Tiffany silverware is dragged out of the closet and polished, her grapevine crystal goblets and hollow-stemmed champagne glasses are washed, and her mother's leaf-imprinted, gold-edged china is brought out.
The plum pudding is made a month in advance, allowing for the marinating rum to soak into the pudding's every atom. The baked apples are slow cooked, and the oysters arrive fresh from Boston. The champagne is chilled, and the goose is roasted before the guests arrive in their tuxedos and evening dresses.
And children are left at home, with the babysitters.
Christmas Eve dinner has been done like this for at least 50 years, according to Eunice Phillips, who carries on the family tradition at her Hancock Point home.
"For as long as I can remember it's been done, and I'm 57," said the Elmira, N.Y., native. "I'm assuming that it's been something that my grandparents had been doing for years."
A few changes have been made over the years, of course. Guests no longer wear tuxedos and evening gowns, as it could be a little precarious getting out of the car wearing heels on Phillips' back road. The goose is no longer fresh, but arrives frozen from Shop n' Save.
"I think the geese that are being raised now are much better," Phillips said. "I never told my mother, but I tended to think that they were dry and extremely fat.
"I can remember taking out three coffee cans of fat," she continued, as her two Schnauzers, Phipps and Chips, cavorted on the couch with her. "But now I think they're moister and not as fat. I enjoy them."
The job of cooking Christmas Eve dinner passed to her while she was still in New York, although Phillip's mother dissuaded her from cooking goose after Grandmother Thompson's death.
"My mother, oddly enough, never liked goose, but always ate it at Christmas time," she recalled. "But when my (maternal) grandmother died, Mom came to me and said, `I don't know how to approach you with this but ..."
So the goose tradition went on hiatus for a few years, but Phillips knew she would bring it back when she left home.
"I'm the traditionalist in the family, so I guess I always knew that I would be the one that would be cooking," she said, noting that her Grandmother Thompson also had that inkling.
Phillips, a nurse manager at Bar Harbor's Summitt House, carries on the Christmas Eve tradition as best her schedule allows. This year, eight members of the Phillips clan celebrated the dinner Dec. 17, but at least the theme remains the same.
"We're a very close family," Phillips said, her white hair framing her blue eyes. "I like doing it. It's very gratifying to do something the everyone enjoys."

Full text: HOLDEN -- Children in the second grade at Holden Elementary School possess a knowledge of intertidal and tidal zone sea life that can easily equal or exceed that of any child who grew up on the Maine coast.
With their teachers, Joy Knowles and Jan Washburn, the pupils have participated for two months in the Maine State Department of Marine Resources-sponsored program called The Sea Comes to the Classroom. It does, in the form of a saltwater aquarium teeming with sea life.
A group of pupils from Knowles' and Washburn's classes gathered earlier this week to show off what they had learned.
Tyler Isherwood, his face close to the aquarium, said, "I like the oyster best because it is the first time I ever saw one. They eat plankton. You can't see it because it is microscopic."
Kelsey Haddix's favorite creature in the saltwater aquarium was the sea anemone. She pointed to the animal that "looks like a plant, only it's really an animal."
Kelly Crotty had no problem deciding what he liked. "The lobster. The way it moves. It's alive and pretty and it can mess up all the others."
Genna Duplisea wanted to be original and pick another resident of the tank, she said, but she said she too had to go with the lobster. "I would have to say the lobster, because the lobster ate the crab."
Kelly Crotty said it also ate a hermit crab when the aquarium was in her classroom.
Nicole LeBlanc said, "The scallop is best because it flies like a flying saucer and you can see its blue eyes when it is open."
David McDonald and Dane Woodhead said they were going to dissect a squid and write their names with its ink.
McDonald added that his No. 1 choice of all the creatures in the aquarium had to be the lobster.
"He doesn't pay attention to where he's going. One time he lost his elastic and ate a hermit crab and a scallop, and the sea cucumber died," he said.
LeBlanc pointed out other occupants in the water. "That's a sea slug, and that's a moon snail."
Woodhead and Ben Pooler liked the moon snail because when a starfish tries to eat it, "it makes a layer of slime and goo on itself and the starfish slips off."
The boys delighted in telling that the starfish's stomach comes out of its mouth to eat up clams and scallops.
"I like the lobster," said Pooler. "It fiddles around and does damage. It killed a clam and a hermit crab. The fish bother him."
The children pointed out a sea whelk, a hermit crab, toad crabs, sea urchins, mussels, clams, scallops, oysters, deep-water slugs, and small fish called mummy chugs.
The purpose of the program, said Elaine Jones, director of Marine Education for the Department of Marine Resources, is to train teachers to be knowledgeable about commercial and recreational fisheries and to assist them in passing that information on to students.
The course is also good for teacher recertification credits, and the teachers then can particpate in the department's classroom program.
Jones said she was pleased with the reaction she was getting from teachers from around the state and the degree of learning from the program that the children have shown.
Jones said she took the job with the department three years ago. "Before I got there, two educators traveled around the state and brought a cooler with sea life with them," she said.
She determined the program, as it was then, provided a service, but really was not training teachers. She managed to get some federal funding, and the program developed. She and two assistants administer the program to groups of teachers all over the state.
The department has five 40-gallon saltwater aquariums and two touch tanks, filled with intertidal and deep-water sea creatures.
The 100-gallon touch tank, which was not placed at the Holden school, said Jones, is an open tub with a refrigerated system because the water in both the tanks and aquariums has to be maintained at around 50 degrees. The tank is about 2 1/2 feet wide and 4 feet long.
The fish, shellfish and animals in the aquarium are fed with scallop meat. It doesn't dissolve in water and the children enjoy watching the animals, she said.
The children also get an understanding of the food chain, especially by watching the lobster. If they forget to feed the animals, the lobster turns on all the other creatures.
"We train the teachers and supply them with the animals," said Jones.
The course operates out of College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor in the summers, where teachers are taken out in the field and taught about the different environments.

Abstract: [Perry] -- Two Perry men have applied for a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to install fixed and floating structures in waters off Eastport and Perry for the cultivation of green sea urchins, Atlantic deep-sea scallops, quahogs, waved whelks, blue mussels and seaweed species to include nori, dulse and Irish moss.

Full text: PERRY -- Two Perry men have applied for a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to install fixed and floating structures in waters off Eastport and Perry for the cultivation of green sea urchins, Atlantic deep-sea scallops, quahogs, waved whelks, blue mussels and seaweed species to include nori, dulse and Irish moss.
Stanley MacNichol and Thomas Pottle filed the application for the federal permit in compliance with Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which provides for federal regulation of any work in, under or over navigable waters of the United States.
The applicants hope to use an irregularly shaped 150-acre subtidal area.
According to a public notice filed by the corps, "Legal size shellfish will be harvested from other areas during open season by traditional means and placed within the cultivation site. After additional grow out, and depending on market demand, they will be harvested and sold to U.S. markets. This bottom culture of shellfish will require no fixed or floating structures with the exception of two 16-by-12-foot bottom moored floating storage boxes which will hold urchins prior to harvesting."
The two men also have submitted a plan to install and maintain up to 40 seaweed grow-out systems. The systems will consist of individual 5-by-10-foot rectangular net panels suspended by buoys from timber stakes driven into the bottom. The net panels will be connected to form 5-by-60-foot units. Those units will be connected together in groups of 12, to form a 60-by-60-foot grow-out system.
An initial installation of 40 systems is planned, but the applicants may install up to 192 systems in the future. Nori and other seaweed species would be harvested seasonally, processed into dried sheets and sold to U.S. markets.
Comments on the application must be submitted before Dec. 30. Written statements should be sent to Jay Clement, at the New England Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, RR 2, Box 1855, Manchester 04351.

Abstract: The clams will be sent to Spinney Creek's plant in Eliot, where they will be cleaned through an extensive process called "depuration," which makes clams from some polluted areas safe to eat. Meanwhile, the Spinney Creek company needs Maine softshell clams to clean and sell to the high end of the shellfish market -- hotel restaurant chains such as the Marriott and city restaurants such as Boston's Legal Seafoods. Spinney Creek buys the clams, tests them and puts them into a big vat full of sterilized sea water that [Thomas Howell] calls a "squeaky clean disinfectant aquarium."

Full text: BRUNSWICK -- About 30 area clam diggers, along with diggers from the Spinney Creek Shellfish company were prepared to start working mud this weekend in the closed Bunganuc area.
The clams will be sent to Spinney Creek's plant in Eliot, where they will be cleaned through an extensive process called "depuration," which makes clams from some polluted areas safe to eat.
The venture is a joint effort between the company and the town. Spinney Creek's plant is the only depuration facility in the state.
"As a steamer, Maine shellfish is best. So, actually I never thought of purchasing from outside the state. The fact of the matter is, the resource is in this state and the way to get it is to work with the town," said Thomas Howell, president of Spinney Creek Shellfish.
The company plans to work a 20-acre stretch of mud at the mouth of Bunganuc Creek, probably until it freezes over and then at times during the winter, said Howell.
"This is just a bonus for the licensed harvesters that we have and it comes at a great time of year when our stocks are down," said Marine Resources Warden Alan J. Houston. "This gives them fresh area that hasn't been turned over a great deal."
The total stretch of clam flats in the Bunganuc area numbers between 70 and 80 acres. The area is closed because of poor water quality. Officials are trying to find out the source of the pollution. It could be large numbers of birds in the area, or nearby farms, said Houston.
"Our No. 1 goal is to get that area cleaned up," he said. But if the area opens, it could take a few years.
Meanwhile, the Spinney Creek company needs Maine softshell clams to clean and sell to the high end of the shellfish market -- hotel restaurant chains such as the Marriott and city restaurants such as Boston's Legal Seafoods.
Spinney Creek buys the clams, tests them and puts them into a big vat full of sterilized sea water that Howell calls a "squeaky clean disinfectant aquarium."
The sea water keeps the clams alive while they pump out contaminants. The clean water also doesn't let any more contaminants into their systems.
Within eight hours, said Howell, the clams are clean. But according to regulations, the process has to take 48 hours.
"As far as competition goes, most of the product we sell is sold in Massachusetts and New York. So these are Massachusetts and New York dollars coming up to Maine," said Howell.
Howell hopes to double his plant's capacity by next summer so that it can handle 60 bushels a day.
The number of areas that are open to depuration digging statewide is decreasing, said Skip Applin, a seafood technology supervisor for the Department of Marine Resources.
"As time goes by, these rivers will get better and pollution will be abated," he said.

Full text: BATH -- The trial of a former Bath Iron Works employee accused of stealing more than $1,000 in Workers' Compensation benefits has ended in an acquittal.
Daniel D. Chubbuck, 51, of Edgecomb, now faces a hearing before the state Workers' Compensation Commission on an attempt by BIW to terminate his benefits.
The shipyard had accused Chubbuck of failing to report his income from commercial shellfishing while he was accepting compensation benefits and then lying under oath about that income.
But jurors acquitted Chubbuck of two counts of theft and one count of perjury after witnesses failed to identify him in photos taken by a private investigator that showed a man on an urchin boat.
Witnesses had trouble determining whether any of the people in the photos was Chubbuck, who resembles his two brothers.
An indictment handed up in January alleged that Chubbuck received between $1,000 and $5,000 in workers' compensation checks between June 1990 and August 1991. BIW claimed that Chubbuck had earned income harvesting clams during the same period but failed to report it.

Full text: MALIBU, Calif. -- If Spike wasn't so lovable, he'd be in hot water by now.
But lobster lovers come in all stripes, and some of Spike's admirers say it's wrong to want him just for his body. They planned a protest Saturday outside Gladstone's 4 Fish, where the 12 1/2-pound Maine lobster is living out his days on display in a tank.
They want him taken back to his North Atlantic home and set free.
Earlier this month, the popular restaurant on Pacific Coast Highway planned to give away the hefty 65-year-old shellfish as a contest prize. Spike would probably have ended up on someone's dinner table, but Gladstone's decided against it.
"The customers and the staff fell in love with him," said Gladstone's spokeswoman Gayla Simmons. "We got a special tank for him, and now people are donating time to keep it up. ..."
United Airlines has offered Spike a free ticket home, both sides said. In a letter Friday, Mary Tyler Moore offered Gladstone's $1,000 to free Spike.
"I am certain that by whatever means a lobster can feel and understand its surroundings, this one would prefer to be back home," wrote the actress-producer.

Abstract: "The Defense Department made the right decision," [Ron Huber] said. "Penobscot Bay is one of the most important spawning and nursery areas of the Gulf of Maine. If the Gulf's fish stocks are to recover, estuaries like Penobscot Bay need to have chronic pollution sources removed." Huber said the fuel storage area supplied the pipeline to Loring Air Force Base in Limestone and the Brunswick Naval Air Station. He claimed that over the past two decades more than 7,000 gallons of JP-4 and JP-5, two forms of jet fuel, are known to have leaked from the facility. Huber said the environmentalists pressed their case to the DEP and DOD during meetings over the renewal of the terminal's license. "The DEP was reluctant at first to agree to the testing, but we convinced them that Penobscot Bay was worth saving," Huber said. "We have strong hopes for Penobscot Bay as it is managed today because the bay is very clean. That's why we want to make sure the muck directly underneath where the oil tankers dock gets tested thoroughly."

Full text: SEARSPORT -- Water and soil tests will be administered around the military storage terminal at Mack Point to determine if thousands of gallons of jet fuel spilled over the years has harmed Penobscot Bay.
Ron Huber, director of the Coastal Waters Project in Rockland, said Thursday that the Defense Department and Maine's Department of Environmental Protection had agreed to implement the tests in the general area of a 5,000-gallon spill that occurred in 1971. The decision was made in response to requests from commercial fisher- men and environmentalists concerned about the spill's possible effects on fish and shellfish.
"The Defense Department made the right decision," Huber said. "Penobscot Bay is one of the most important spawning and nursery areas of the Gulf of Maine. If the Gulf's fish stocks are to recover, estuaries like Penobscot Bay need to have chronic pollution sources removed."
Huber said the fuel storage area supplied the pipeline to Loring Air Force Base in Limestone and the Brunswick Naval Air Station. He claimed that over the past two decades more than 7,000 gallons of JP-4 and JP-5, two forms of jet fuel, are known to have leaked from the facility. Huber said the environmentalists pressed their case to the DEP and DOD during meetings over the renewal of the terminal's license.
"The services were claiming that the fuel had evaporated and was gone," Huber said. "The DEP was taking them on good faith instead of checking. They basically were walking around looking for oil sheen in puddles."
He said the testing was critical because scientists have linked petroleum contamination of the sea floor to incomplete egg development, deformed young and increased cancer in flounder and other bottom-dwelling fish species.
While much of the petroleum from the earlier spills is believed to have dissipated, Huber said that jet fuel additives, such as ethylene bromide, persist in the environment for an unknown length of time. Ethylene bromide is a powerful carcinogen that has also been linked to birth defects and infertility.
"The DEP was reluctant at first to agree to the testing, but we convinced them that Penobscot Bay was worth saving," Huber said. "We have strong hopes for Penobscot Bay as it is managed today because the bay is very clean. That's why we want to make sure the muck directly underneath where the oil tankers dock gets tested thoroughly."
The DOD plan calls for testing core samples of soil, sediment and water from around the terminal site for the presence of a host of petrochemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAH's, which have been linked to a variety of fish ailments. Tests will be taken of the ditch and culvert that carried the 1971 spill to the beach.
Work will begin next spring and will be paid for from the budget of DOD's Fuel Support Center, Huber said.
Charlie Stevens, vice president of Clams Fiesta Inc., of Vinalhaven, said the shellfish aquaculture firm had surveyed Penobscot Bay for potential aquaculture sites last year, but found levels of petrochemical pollution too high in most of the bay.
"As a businessman, I'm disappointed that most of Penobscot Bay is unsuitable for shellfish aquaculture," Stevens said. "It's not until you are below Vinalhaven Island that the water quality is good enough. This severely limits shellfish aquaculture in the midcoast area."
Coastal activist Bob LaVangie, who also attended the meetings with the agencies, said he was pleased by the DEP's interest in biomonitoring. Biomonitoring involves placing mesh bags of clean mussels underwater in the vicinity of the terminal at Mack Point and testing them six months later for accumulated pollution.
"This will give us an accurate picture of the pollution situation," LaVangie said, adding that he and the other concerned parties planned to provide financial assistance for the testing program.

Abstract: According to Randy Burns, a member of the committee, clam harvesters have been meeting regularly at the town hall since early summer to find ways to stimulate and revitalize the clam industry. Clam diggers and others interested in the once abundant softshell clam industry are frustrated with a diminishing resource and the regulatory process. Members of DRSC have been successful in enlisting the expertise needed to begin resolving problems that affect clams. Last August, [Julie Hachey] and Burns met with University of Maine President Fred Hutchinson in Harrington. Hutchinson was interested in problems that affect the clam industry, and has since outlined the group's needs to his research faculty from the university's Fisheries and Aquaculture Research Group (FARG). Dr. Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, told the group that only 20 percent of the growth of a clam occurs between May and June. Sixty percent occurs between June and August. One hundred percent growth taks place between April and mid-October. The professor said the different growth patterns were important to consider when the group devises a clam management plan.

Full text: ADDISON -- The dwindling clam industry and the closing of clam beds because of pollution will be among issues for discussion by the Down East Regional Shellfish Committee and state officials at 7 p.m. Monday, Nov. 21, at Addison Town Hall.
Paul Anderson, a biologist with the Department of Marine Resources at Lamoine, and Charlie Parker, a water quality aide with the Washington County Cooperative Extension, will discuss pollution closures in the Jonesport, Harrington and Addison area.
According to Randy Burns, a member of the committee, clam harvesters have been meeting regularly at the town hall since early summer to find ways to stimulate and revitalize the clam industry. Clam diggers and others interested in the once abundant softshell clam industry are frustrated with a diminishing resource and the regulatory process.
The DRSC consists of delegates representing the shellfish committees of Harrington, Addison and Jonesport. Assisting in organizing the DRSC has been the Washington County Cooperative Extension.
Members of the new group elected Julie Hachey of Addison and Walter Shafer of Harrington co-chairmen of the committee.
Although the clam harvest this summer seemed encouraging when compared to the 1993 landings, DRSC members have chosen not to be overly optimistic about the future of the resource.
"Something is wrong out there. We see a lot of seed clams but they don't seem to develop," said Hachey, who digs clams in Addison.
The committee's outlook is confirmed by data from the Department of Marine Resources which suggests an 84 percent decrease in landings since 1984.
The three towns have more than 170 licensed diggers and 4,500 acres of potentially productive clam beds. This represents a significant economic resource to each town and the region, said Burns.
Burns and other members said in a press release Thursday that they can play an important roll in improving shellfish management by providing a means of communication between diggers, their towns and regulatory agencies such as the DMR. The DRSC will use information gathered to strengthen each town's local shellfish committee.
Several issues concerning the future of the clam resource have been debated by the committee. Topics of concern have ranged from scuba diving for clams to the issue of financial investment vs beneficial returns from clam seeding projects.
Burns said a strong consensus of opinion has developed within the group on several issues. These included the need for gaining assurance that other factors -- such as agricultural chemicals, overboard waste discharges, and marine bloodworms and sandworms -- are not having an adverse impact on the clam population.
Members of DRSC have been successful in enlisting the expertise needed to begin resolving problems that affect clams. Last August, Hachey and Burns met with University of Maine President Fred Hutchinson in Harrington. Hutchinson was interested in problems that affect the clam industry, and has since outlined the group's needs to his research faculty from the university's Fisheries and Aquaculture Research Group (FARG).
Dr. Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, told the group that only 20 percent of the growth of a clam occurs between May and June. Sixty percent occurs between June and August. One hundred percent growth taks place between April and mid-October. The professor said the different growth patterns were important to consider when the group devises a clam management plan.
As a result of the DRSC's contact with Beal, the Harrington Shellfish Committee decided to work with the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery in a project to determine the effects of harvesting blood and sand worms on the survival and growth of seed clams.
Harrington, already involved in a reseeding program to begin in April, has requested from DMR a three-year conservation closure in two of the town's small coves. If granted, the closure would provide security for the seed clams and an opportunity for the town and hatchery to conduct necessary research.

Abstract: Federal grants to Maine's struggling fishing industry are giving a boost to projects that range from boats with computerized "jigging machines" to farmed cod and haddock. The grants to Maine include $174,220 to study computerized machines that fish with hooks instead of nets. John Clyde Williamson, a Kennebunk gillnet fisherman, will work with three other people to study the jigging machines now used by some Icelandic fishermen. Under a $247,333 grant, a Maine "longline" fishing boat that uses hooks instead of nets will explore the mile-deep waters beyond Georges Bank to find out what kind of fish dwell there.

Full text: PORTLAND -- Federal grants to Maine's struggling fishing industry are giving a boost to projects that range from boats with computerized "jigging machines" to farmed cod and haddock.
The grants are part of a $9 million program intended to develop new opportunities for New England fishermen, while taking pressure off stocks of groundfish that have declined to historic lows.
Of 28 grants totaling $4.5 million that have already been awarded, eight have gone to Maine. An additional $4.5 million is to be parceled out across the region this winter.
The grants to Maine include $174,220 to study computerized machines that fish with hooks instead of nets. John Clyde Williamson, a Kennebunk gillnet fisherman, will work with three other people to study the jigging machines now used by some Icelandic fishermen.
Under a $247,333 grant, a Maine "longline" fishing boat that uses hooks instead of nets will explore the mile-deep waters beyond Georges Bank to find out what kind of fish dwell there.
The potential catch includes orange roughy, little-known types of redfish or a strange "oilfish" that is used as food and in laxatives.
Another grant, for $37,668, seeks to determine whether marketable products can be made out of lobster shells. If successful, it would help in the disposal of the shellfish wastes and create new jobs for fishermen.
An aquaculture project that seeks to develop techniques to cultivate cod and/or haddock in hatcheries has been awarded a $500,490 grant. The fish would be released in the ocean to replenish wild fish stocks or raised in fish farms to market size.
Another project, which received an $89,725 grant, is aimed at developing a cost-effective way to harvest nori seaweed, so individuals can establish seaweed farms.
The projects provide a glimpse into the future of New England's fisheries and fishing industry.
"These pose interesting ideas that are cutting edge in terms of using the resource," said William Brennan, commissioner of the Department of Marine Resources.
The $9 million in fishing industry grants is part of the $30 million in emergency relief money that the federal government said it would provide to help ease the impact of fishing restrictions aimed at stemming the decline in groundfish stocks.
The projects fall into three categories: developing underutilized fish species; creating opportunities in aquaculture; and creating new job prospects for fishermen who leave fishing.
Barbara Stevenson, a Portland fishing boat owner who was awarded a grant to fish in the deep waters beyond Georges Bank, said there are probably fish in the region nobody has ever caught commercially.
"Because it's such a large area and nobody's fished out there, it's too high of a risk, without a grant, to find something to fish on," she said.

Full text: WALDOBORO -- Loose lips in Warren sank a pair of burglars in Waldoboro believed responsible for a string of break-ins.
Waldoboro Police Chief Leroy Jones said Wednesday an investigation by the Knox County Sheriff's Department of a possible attempt to sell a stolen gun at the Oyster River gun shop in Warren led to the arrest of an adult and a juvenile for three burglaries in Lincoln County.
Jones said Shawn Joslyn, 18, of Coopers Mills and a 17-year-old male juvenile have been charged with burglary and theft for two Oct. 20 break-ins in his town and another the same day in Jefferson, with additional cases still under investigation. Weapons, electronic goods and cash were taken in the three daytime burglaries.
The case broke late last week when an unidentified youth tried to buy an ammunition clip for a rifle at a Waldoboro gun shop. Unable to find what he needed, the youth mentioned to the clerk that he would try to find it at Oyster River. Concerned that the gun may have been stolen, the clerk notified the Knox County Sheriff's Department.
Deputy Donald Scribner found the youth at Oyster River. Although the rifle turned out not to be stolen, the youth told Scribner he knew about the burglaries, including who the burglars were and where the stolen property was hidden.
Jones said cracking the case "took some luck in getting the tip and getting the information we needed, and a good cooperative effort by Knox County.

Abstract: "Do you favor a $9,000,000 bond issue for the following purposes: (1) Four million dollars for construction of local water pollution control facilities, providing the state match for $20,000,000 in federal funds; (2) $1,000,000 for the Small Community Program; and (3) four million dollars to provide for the investigation, abatement and mitigation of threats to the public health and environment from uncontrolled hazardous substance sites or other hazardous waste discharges." For Maine's larger communities, the Department of Environmental Protection will use $4 million from this bond to match $20 million from the federal government to bolster the State Revolving Loan Fund (SRLF). The SRLF lends money to communities at below market rates to underwrite sewage treatment projects.

Full text: "Do you favor a $9,000,000 bond issue for the following purposes: (1) Four million dollars for construction of local water pollution control facilities, providing the state match for $20,000,000 in federal funds; (2) $1,000,000 for the Small Community Program; and (3) four million dollars to provide for the investigation, abatement and mitigation of threats to the public health and environment from uncontrolled hazardous substance sites or other hazardous waste discharges."
Twelve times since 1960, Maine voters have dug down to bond water-pollution control projects. Next Tuesday, it is important to the quality of Maine's environment, and the economic health of its communities, that this trend of support continue.
Question 2 will address three separate programs, two that will help ease the financial burden on cities and small towns to build or maintain sewage treatment programs, and a third that will continue funding of a statewide effort to repair damage to water quality done by hazardous substances leaching from uncontrolled sites.
For Maine's larger communities, the Department of Environmental Protection will use $4 million from this bond to match $20 million from the federal government to bolster the State Revolving Loan Fund (SRLF). The SRLF lends money to communities at below market rates to underwrite sewage treatment projects.
Approximately $99 million has been loaned out so far, and in 1995, if this bond is supported by voters, cities such as Skowhegan, Brewer, Dover-Foxcroft and Bangor will have access to a fresh infusion of money to pay for construction or major maintenance on local sewage treatment projects.
Another $1 million from the bond will go to small towns where central sewage treatment facilities are impractical, but where homeowners or sometimes municipalities themselves have failing septic systems that need to be corrected or replaced.
This program already has been supported eight times by the public (to the total tune of $12.5 million). The grants to smaller communities are important to protect both fresh and salt water (20 new grants this year went to clean up shellfish-harvesting areas).
When hazardous substances are detected leaching into the water, the state steps in. In four out of five instances, the DEP identifies the responsible party, but the mess still must be controlled and mitigated. Since 1983, Maine voters have approved three similar bonds totaling $7.3 million. Without $4 million in additional funds from this request, this needed program eventually grinds to a halt.
Clean water is an asset in which Maine has invested nearly $200 million during the past quarter century. It makes good sense to continue that investment by voting "Yes" on Question 2.

A sparkling evening Wine dinner is true taste of elegance

Abstract: This weekend, as part of "Autumn in Blue Hill," a celebration of wine and food sponsored by five businesses in the small coastal town, the innkeepers Mary and Don Hartley hosted a wine dinner of local delicacies and American wine. It was one of two wine dinners and several events, including more traditional wine tastings, seminars and meals, organized around wine and food over the weekend. After the innkeepers politely seated the 35 guests at assigned tables, the first wine of dinner, a Fume Blanc Reserve, was introduced by Tim Clark, who lives in Wells and represents Mondavi. This "smoky white" wine has a name coined by Mondavi and is considered one of the world's best complements to shellfish, according to Clark. It is called "reserve" because it is the top of the best, and also of note because it is the first of Mondavi's wines to be released with the environmentally-sensitive flange-top and natural wax seal. His bliss was interrupted by a knife tapping on a glass, and Clark prepared the diners for the next wine, Mondavi's hottest work, a 1991 Pinot Noir Reserve, which was served with consumme containing guinea hen and oyster mushrooms. A velvety red wine with hints of clove, cinnamon, cassis and berry flavors, the Pinot was the reason wine importers Ed and Judi Mansing drove from Portland to attend the wine dinner. Ed Mansing's car has the license plate "MR PINOT," and the Mansings closed their eyes as they sipped from the half-full balloon wine glasses.

Full text: You've heard of bean suppers and hunters' breakfasts.
Now meet the wine dinner.
It might go something like this:
Through a fluted champagne glass, you see bubbles giggle off of candle light. You savor a bite of green olive tapenade canapes while listening to a woman talk about a book she wrote 20 years ago, or a man explain his reasons for leaving the city life behind. Each table setting has nine utensils and six different glasses. An aroma of gourmet foods so dreamily fills the air that you could happily go mad trying to decipher each nuance.
OK, OK. It's not something you're going to find in a church hall or school cafeteria. It won't be announced by a sign on the side of the road, and it won't be as affordable as a $5 meal. It may not even be something you understand completely because the jargon of hard-core wine drinkers leaves most people dry. And how many people really know -- or care -- what all that silverware is supposed to be used for anyway?
Still, a perfectly prepared wine dinner is a true taste of elegance and ecstasy for the palate. And Blue Hill Inn, which has been hosting wine dinners a couple times a year for five years, knows that it's on to one of the most delicious trends in fine dining today.
This weekend, as part of "Autumn in Blue Hill," a celebration of wine and food sponsored by five businesses in the small coastal town, the innkeepers Mary and Don Hartley hosted a wine dinner of local delicacies and American wine. It was one of two wine dinners and several events, including more traditional wine tastings, seminars and meals, organized around wine and food over the weekend.
Representatives from two major American wineries, Beringer and Robert Mondavi, attended the dinner and spoke about the wine served with each course.
The Maison Deutz, served with the tapenade, was a California sparkler, said Mimi Giammarino, who works for Wine World Estates in Massachusetts and came to Maine for the weekend to represent Beringer. A cross varietal wine that is "toasty," the Maison Deutz was a sweet start to the meal.
After the innkeepers politely seated the 35 guests at assigned tables, the first wine of dinner, a Fume Blanc Reserve, was introduced by Tim Clark, who lives in Wells and represents Mondavi. This "smoky white" wine has a name coined by Mondavi and is considered one of the world's best complements to shellfish, according to Clark. It is called "reserve" because it is the top of the best, and also of note because it is the first of Mondavi's wines to be released with the environmentally-sensitive flange-top and natural wax seal.
Local wine specialist, David Witter, who co-runs Blue Hill Tea & Tobacco Shop and is a wine consultant for the Blue Hill Inn, stuck his nose in the round goblet and breathed deeply the tropical fruit aromas, toasty citrus flavors, and rich spice, nut and vanilla undertones of the Fume Blanc. He raised his head and smiled while he swirled the liquid and lifted it to his lips. Combined with the Cape Neddick oysters with spinach and curry, the Fume Blanc was a winner with Witter.
"Very nice," he said. "Very smooth."
His bliss was interrupted by a knife tapping on a glass, and Clark prepared the diners for the next wine, Mondavi's hottest work, a 1991 Pinot Noir Reserve, which was served with consumme containing guinea hen and oyster mushrooms. A velvety red wine with hints of clove, cinnamon, cassis and berry flavors, the Pinot was the reason wine importers Ed and Judi Mansing drove from Portland to attend the wine dinner. Ed Mansing's car has the license plate "MR PINOT," and the Mansings closed their eyes as they sipped from the half-full balloon wine glasses.
"Wine enhances food and food enhances wine," explained Judi Mansing, who left teaching to become a wine importer with her husband. "It's that blend that makes a perfect marriage."
In keeping with her philosphy, Judi Mansing suggested tasting the wine first, then the food, then the wine. In doing so, all the best flavors would be brought out, and she was right. The flavor went from sharp to mild to heavenly.
Every wine dinner gets a little louder with each course, said Giammarino when she interrupted the dining clamor to introduce the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon that would be served with gratin of lamb medallions with leeks and westphalian ham.
"It's a concentrated fruit," she said of the wine. "The soft tannin makes you feel you have little sweaters on your teeth. It shows itself beautifully."
Several diners nodded in agreement as they took their first sip and then began eating.
After dinner, figs with rocamadour, roquefort and aged cheddar cheeses were served with Beringer's 1990 Merlot. "It's not your typical Merlot," Giammarino said grinning widely and holding up a glass of it next to her face. She explained that the grapes for this red wine are grown in California's Howell Mountain Vineyard, which is 750 miles above sea level in Napa Valley and has incredible solar penetration by day but doesn't cool down at night. The intensity of heat makes for an fast growing season and a "mean Merlot."
The final wine of the evening was a delicate, fragrant varietal called Moscato d'Oro, which is grown from an ancient grape first used 5,000 years ago in the Macedonia region. Clark compared it to an Asti spumante without the fizz, and said it was perfectly suited to the apple tart that was served. Later, over espresso, David Witter said that American wines are increasingly popular and make up nearly 45 percent of wine sales in his Blue Hill shop.
"American wines have been really good for the last 10 years," he added. "The quality is every bit as good as the French wines, but you've got to be more selective. People used to buy labels. Then they bought countries. Now, I'd rather have them just buy wines."
Before the three-hour wining-dining experience ended, Chef Andre Strong, who designed the meal in conjunction with the wine representatives, greeted the diners. They applauded his artistic presentations and delicious cuisine.
"There was a subtlety in the food that allowed the wine to express itself, and gave it a whole new flavor," said one man through the applause.
With memories of sophisticated and enticing flavors swirling on their tongues, the guests filed out into the crisp Maine night. They were still warm inside, of course, and would be until they fell asleep in the gentlest of sated tempers brought on by a wine dinner.

Prohibition repeal debated in Lamoine Some say alcohol sale would ruin unique character of their town

Abstract: That low level of business activity leads [Lamoine] Selectman Bill Collier to speak in favor of changing the town's status from dry to wet. At a public hearing this week on the issue, Collier said the liquor prohibition keeps new business, such as hotels, restaurants and campgrounds, from considering a Lamoine location. Resident Bob Alvarez agreed. About 20 years ago, Alvarez tried the general store business, operating out of his former home near Lamoine State Park. "We couldn't make a go of it because we couldn't sell beer," Alvarez said. "No store is feasible anywhere without beer. We're going beyond the realm of reasonableness that we want to be a dry town." Alluding to Lamoine's self-described status as a bedroom community of Ellsworth, Alvarez said it was a designation that leaves residential property owners paying all the taxes. "All Lamoine is getting (as a bedroom community) is kids to educate. Unless you're a schoolteacher, there is nothing great about Lamoine being a bedroom community."

Full text: LAMOINE -- Wet or dry: It's a question of town character residents are debating in the days leading up to a vote on repealing prohibition in Lamoine.
Those favoring a repeal of the prohibition against the sale of beer and wine argue new business might move into town if liquor can be sold, bringing with it some tax relief for residents and improving the economic character of life for the community.
Others argue that prohibition is part of Lamoine's unique character as a bedroom community. A convenience store or restaurant, they contend, would mean more traffic, trash and noise.
The question of changing the town's classification from dry to wet goes before voters Nov. 8. Lamoine is now one of only 26 communities left in Maine where the sale of beer and wine is still prohibited.
A successful petition drive over the summer has placed the matter before voters. Two Lamoine residents drafted the petition as a precursor for their proposed plans to open a small convenience store at one of the more traveled intersections in this small coastal community.
Ruth Keene and David Schroeder contend their plans are contingent on the town's repeal of its prohibition status, as a convenience store could not succeed financially without the sale of beer and wine.
Schroeder says his store "will be a quaint little store in a quaint little town that happens to sell alcohol."
Lamoine, a town of about 1,300 residents, has no business district and no stores. Almost exclusively residential, the Hancock County town with 28 miles of shoreline has only a handful of at-home businesses and contractors with small yards.
Thirteen active gravel pits owned primarily by out-of-town companies, two small shellfish-packing businesses and a lobster pound compose the remainder of significant business enterprise in Lamoine.
That low level of business activity leads Lamoine Selectman Bill Collier to speak in favor of changing the town's status from dry to wet. At a public hearing this week on the issue, Collier said the liquor prohibition keeps new business, such as hotels, restaurants and campgrounds, from considering a Lamoine location.
"Without being able to sell alcohol, we'll never have a store here," Collier said. "We shouldn't keep on hobbling business in Lamoine."
Resident Bob Alvarez agreed. About 20 years ago, Alvarez tried the general store business, operating out of his former home near Lamoine State Park. "We couldn't make a go of it because we couldn't sell beer," Alvarez said. "No store is feasible anywhere without beer. We're going beyond the realm of reasonableness that we want to be a dry town."
Alluding to Lamoine's self-described status as a bedroom community of Ellsworth, Alvarez said it was a designation that leaves residential property owners paying all the taxes. "All Lamoine is getting (as a bedroom community) is kids to educate. Unless you're a schoolteacher, there is nothing great about Lamoine being a bedroom community."
But others argue the quality of life in Lamoine would be diminished if the town votes to allow the sale of liquor, as business growth could follow.
Edward Coan, whose property is adjacent to the proposed location for a store, contends Lamoine's status as a dry community is worthy of preservation. "One unique feature of Lamoine is that it is dry. We don't have stores. We have a fortunate situation."
Coan said this week any need for business in Lamoine is "watered down" by the proximity of Ellsworth only a few miles down the road. "Look at Trenton and Ellsworth, where liquor is readily available," Coan said. "See if you think life there is more rewarding to you or your children."
Resident Andrea Gabel-Richards wondered whether business development might "change the tenor of the town," bringing in "changes to Lamoine that won't be good."
Another resident agreed. "I like the idea of Lamoine being clean." She said she favored more bed-and-breakfast establishments or cottage industries that don't rely on alcohol sales. "We want businesses ... that won't mess up our landscape," she said.
Although debated as a matter of character for the town, questions about the effects of making alcohol more available are clearly part of the issue for some.
According to Collier, those who want to drink will drive anywhere to purchase alcohol. "Prohibition doesn't work. We don't reduce drinking in Lamoine (because of prohibition)," he said. "We just force people to go to Ellsworth," thus increasing the likelihood of people driving drunk.
But resident Mary Moore disagreed. "I don't want alcohol sold here." If a store in town sells beer and wine, she said, "it would make it easier for people to drink, particularly for kids."

Cobscook Bay Spectacular Conservation efforts to preserve region's many natural beauties

Author: Tom Fuller Special to the NEWS

Abstract: Of particular importance to waterfowl biologists is the fact that Cobscook is a unique and vitally important haven for migrating and wintering black ducks, which have been singled out from all other waterfowl in North America as a species of international concern. Black duck numbers are down, and while most other wildfowl species have begun to respond to international efforts to restore their numbers, black duck numbers have remained tenaciously low. Cobscook Bay's importance is underlined by the fact that fully 25 percent of all black ducks discovered during Maine's annual mid-winter waterfowl count reside in the relatively small confines of this estuary. In the past decade, however, the pressure on the land has been building. More farms have been subdivided, more shorefront lots broken out, and more prime habitat threatened. Many individuals, and several private and public organizations, identified the threat relatively early on. In 1987, a group of farsighted, but short-funded, individuals formed the Quoddy Regional Land Trust (QRLT). With their self-imposed goal of preserving land in a small corner of Maine, namely the Cobscook and Quoddy regions of Washington County, the group began accepting development easements from concerned land owners. The Maine Coast Heritage Trust (MCHT) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) also identified the threat and focused some of their attention on the Cobscook area. Yet funds were chronically short or entirely nonexistent to protect major sections of the bay. The tides in Cobscook Bay determine when fishermen go out. Low tide often means fishing boats are left high and dry (far left). Reversing Falls Park (above) lies on the southern point of Leighten Neck facing Crow Neck. Canadian geese are among the many species of birds in the Cobscook Bay area. (Tom Fuller Photos) Maine's rocky coast offers unending resistance to the power of the tides in the Cobscook Bay area.

Full text: Cobscook Bay is a wild and humbling place. It lies at the eastern tip of the United States, in Maine, and has for centuries responded only to the natural rhythms of the earth. Those rhythms are not subtle here. They are emphatic and bold. They center on the regular ebb and flow of the most powerful tides in the country -- tides that every six hours rise and fall 24 feet, an average of 1 foot every 15 minutes.
The tides, and the rugged coastline that they batter, offer spectacular beauty to all who see them. But they also harbor one of the most fertile ecosystems in the country. With the immense flow of water throughout the complex that is Cobscook Bay comes an equally immense movement of nutrition. From the plankton and microscopic organisms on up the food chain through the shellfish and herring to the large aquatic mammals, seals and whales, the waters of Cobscook Bay are an immense breadbasket of life. In addition, the untamed coastline and adjacent uplands are filled with wildlife, much of it depending on the sea.
Bald eagles are the most spectacular example of the wildlife here. Seventeen pairs now nest and raise young on the islands and shores of the inlets and back bays of Cobscook. And up to 400 eagles winter here and feast on the abundant sea life. This concentration of eagles is the densest of any region in the Northeast and the core from which biologists hope will spring a rejuvenated population of our national symbol.
In addition, Cobscook and its shoreline is also a haven for thousands upon thousands of shorebirds, like sandpipers, yellowlegs, rails and herons; for unusual and rare water birds like loons and grebes; for both nesting and migrating waterfowl like Canada geese, brandt, gadwalls, teal, black ducks, wood ducks and mallards; for diving ducks like hooded mergansers, scaup, ring-necked ducks, goldeneyes and buffleheads; for upland mammals and birds, like woodcock, spruce and ruffed grouse, bobcats, river otters, deer, bears and moose. In fact, over 200 species of birds and animals have been documented in the area by biologists working in the Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge on the western headlands of the bay.
Of particular importance to waterfowl biologists is the fact that Cobscook is a unique and vitally important haven for migrating and wintering black ducks, which have been singled out from all other waterfowl in North America as a species of international concern. Black duck numbers are down, and while most other wildfowl species have begun to respond to international efforts to restore their numbers, black duck numbers have remained tenaciously low. Cobscook Bay's importance is underlined by the fact that fully 25 percent of all black ducks discovered during Maine's annual mid-winter waterfowl count reside in the relatively small confines of this estuary.
Yet the spectacular beauty and unusual fertility of the region has brought on a familiar threat -- subdivision of the land and development. While Cobscook and its immediate vicinity has largely escaped the rampant love of the land that has transformed much of the Maine coastline into a sea of cottages, seasonal homes and tourist attractions, the inevitable swell of pressure has increasingly infringed on the wild places of the bay. Only its remote location and the ability of the rest of the coast to absorb the demand for more land have kept Cobscook relatively safe, until recently.
In the past decade, however, the pressure on the land has been building. More farms have been subdivided, more shorefront lots broken out, and more prime habitat threatened. Many individuals, and several private and public organizations, identified the threat relatively early on. In 1987, a group of farsighted, but short-funded, individuals formed the Quoddy Regional Land Trust (QRLT). With their self-imposed goal of preserving land in a small corner of Maine, namely the Cobscook and Quoddy regions of Washington County, the group began accepting development easements from concerned land owners. The Maine Coast Heritage Trust (MCHT) and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) also identified the threat and focused some of their attention on the Cobscook area. Yet funds were chronically short or entirely nonexistent to protect major sections of the bay.
With the signing of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan by Canada, the United States and Mexico in 1986, and the subsequent creation of the Atlantic Coast Joint Venture, a specific mechanism was created to coordinate the efforts of all organizations and individuals concerned with the accelerated decline of healthy wetlands habitat throughout the North American continent. The plan specifically encouraged cooperation throughout the conservation community to protect critical habitat.
In Maine, a unique assembly of public and private organizations pooled their knowledge and efforts to form the Maine Wetlands Protection Coalition under the patronage of the Atlantic Coast Joint Venture. Represented in the group were the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Land for Maine's Future Board from the public sector, and TNC, Ducks Unlimited, MCHT, QRLT, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and others from the private sector. They identified five significant focus areas in the state in priority, making the Cobscook Bay area No. 1 on the list.
The job of protecting the bay was divided into four phases, with the first phase budgeted for completion in 1991 and the last for 1995. A total of 7,137 acres and 76.2 miles of shoreline were targeted for protection.
The financial and inspirational leaders for getting the project off the ground were the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Land for Maine's Future Board. By providing more than $1.8 million from the citizens of Maine to initiate key acquisitions, federal matching funds were acquired to further protect important habitat.
"The fact that this project is highly rated nationally should confirm just how really unique and important Cobscook Bay is to fish and wildlife resources," said Gary Donovan, the director of the wildlife division for Maine. "To be part of this effort has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career."
In addition, the vigor with which the state pursued protection for the area helped to cement the effort of the USF&WS to expand its Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge to protect critical habitat in the Dennys Bay area of Cobscook. That effort is geared toward 1,190 acres of prime waterfowl staging areas and eagle nesting habitat and is well under way.
And with more matching funds acquired from the North American Wetlands Conservation Act in the summer of 1994, and with money anticipated from the Interior Department for Moosehorn, the entire project soon may be completed, essentially on time and under budget.
Yet if the public organizations have provided the map through the bureaucratic maze of paperwork and funding, it is the private organizations, namely QRLT, the MCHT and TNC, that have provided the inspiration and perspiration to help individual land owners in the region understand, appreciate and embrace the project.
Specifically, QRLT, led by Allan Brooks, its executive director, and Nancy Nielsen, one of its founding members and a guiding light, have done much to assure landowners that the preservation of their acres need not be a grudging concession to big government nor a painful sacrifice of their property rights. Indeed much of the preservation that has been accomplished in the Cobscook area involves both donated and purchased easements, where landowners retain title to their land but deed development rights to a land stewardship organization.
"The people of Washington County and Cobscook Bay well understand the importance of the project," said Nancy Nielsen, "and our being a very small, regional land trust helps ensure that area residents will always have an important voice."
The MCHT, which has specialized in land easements since 1970, has lent its expertise in the negotiation of easements and the sometimes complex meanderings of the legalities involved. And TNC has been especially interested in sites with particular value to endangered species.
Each of these organizations has served the important purpose of putting a human face on a large and complex process. That process has involved many individuals, and the private organizations have assured each of them that they are as important and critical as any others.
At least as important to the local residents in the area is the fact that many innovative methods for preserving the land have been used, often benefiting them financially. Saving the Bay also may prove of benefit because it is a unique and expansive area, with many natural features and much abundant wildlife. That fact alone may provide a substantial boost to the local economy.
The Cobscook Bay Habitat Protection Project is nearing completion. There are still several key tracts that must be conserved, but much has already been accomplished. Most importantly, however, is the fact that an area of unique beauty and unparalleled wildlife diversity and importance has been recognized for its intrinsic value and has been preserved for the future.

Full text: STONINGTON -- Storm runoff that followed two days of heavy rain Down East forced the state to close clam flats in Washington and Hancock counties, authorities said Sunday.
Most coastal areas along the midcoast and Down East recorded 3 to 5 inches of rain Friday night and Saturday, said Hendricus Lulofs, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
The highest rainfall total was measured in Deer Isle, which was deluged with 5.29 inches of rain, Lulofs said.
Pollution caused by the water runoff and raw sewage contaminated coastal waters, forcing the state to stop the harvesting of shellfish, said Sgt. George Openshaw from the Maine Marine Patrol.

Full text: In the year ahead, AmeriCorps members will get things done in Maine that for too long have fallen by the wayside for lack of human or monetary resources. Fifty-six men and women sworn in by President Clinton in Maine via satellite last month have already begun work in national and community service programs aimed at meeting human, environmental, public safety and educational needs.
Maine's AmeriCorps assignments run the gamut from building and rerouting trails and resolving neighborhood conflicts to arming refugees, seasonal farmworkers, at-risk youths and low-income people with the skills they need to improve their prospects.
Others aim to stamp out illiteracy, improve water quality, deliver AIDS-HIV awareness and education, and assist agriculture and fisheries agencies to inventory natural resources and conduct conservation education programs.
Touted as the Clinton Administration's domestic Peace Corps and the heir of the work legacy handed down by the Depression-Era Civilian Conservation Corps, AmeriCorps will engage thousands of Americans in similar work across the country that might not otherwise be done.
Participating programs represent a mix of projects, some that existed before and became part of AmeriCorps, and others that arose because of it.
Most of the funding for the effort comes from the Corporation for National and Community Service, established under provisions of the National Community Service Trust Act of 1993. Grants are competitive and can be renewed yearly.
While most of the 86 positions earmarked for five AmeriCorps programs in Maine have already been filled, some programs are still recruiting. The movement is still in its infancy and word is still getting out.
As a group, Maine's current AmeriCorps members defy description. They span all age groups from 17 on up and come from varied economic and educational backgrounds. The minimum requirement for some jobs is high school completion. Other positions require some college or vocational training.
It's unlikely that AmeriCorps members are in it for the money. Most will receive minimum wage -- well under what they'd earn doing the same work in the private sector. Some, however, will receive slightly higher pay for work requiring college degrees or vocational training. The minimum anyone can make is about $7,600 and the maximum is $12,000.
AmeriCorps members also will receive free health care and $4,725 educational awards for each year (1,700 hours) of service. Recruits serve for up to two years. The educational awards can be used for college or vocational education or to pay off student loans.
"There's no age limit but I suspect they're mostly fairly young," said Robert Blakesley, executive director of the Maine Community Service Program administered by the State Planning Office. Blakesley and his staff are charged with providing administrative services for AmeriCorps programs in Maine and for a new state commission appointed last month by Gov. John R. McKernan.
The 19-member Maine Commission for Community Service was established to "to encourage community service and volunteerism as a means of meeting critical human, environmental, educational and public safety needs throughout the state."
The commission will work in partnership with AmeriCorps and other federal programs to assist volunteer programs and foster networking among government and nonprofit groups serving Maine people. It was authorized to accept grants and gifts, initiate community service programs, and make subgrants to nonprofit agencies, communities and educational entities.
Following is a look at what Maine's five AmeriCorps teams will do this year:
Learning while conserving
Headquartered at Unity College, the College Conservation Corps of Maine began two years ago as a program of the state Department of Labor. This year, it falls under the umbrella of AmeriCorps.
The 20-member team led by Kenneth Spalding will carry out conservation projects, such as rerouting trails at Camden Hills State Park, Lake St. George State Park, Reid State Park, Baxter State Park and in Bangor and Bethel and elsewhere.
Members also will stabilize shorelines, clear and mark boundary lines, rebuild river access points and run the Unity Area Recycling Center. During the winter the group will live at the college, attending classes while working part-time. They'll work full-time during breaks.
Rural waters, trails and habitats
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service landed a grant for a 20-member Rural Development Team assigned to rural locations in several counties.
This team's focus is water quality and resource protection. The job list includes developing a crop management program with cranberry growers, conducting lakeshore sanitary surveys, turning old railroad tracks into recreational trails, staffing a shellfish hatchery, studying fish habitats, inventorying natural resources, and conducting conservation education programs.
Lakes Coordinator Raymonde Violette and Samonoid Coordinator Amanda Smith-Hatch, are two of the four team members assigned to Aroostook County.
Smith-Hatch considers herself lucky to find a job in her field just four days after moving to Maine from Texas. "It was fate -- something I fell into," she said. With AmeriCorps, she can "do Peace Corps-type work without having to give up home life or American life."
St. John Valley communities with a stake in the controversial plan to bring Atlantic salmon to the upper St. John River beyond Grand Falls will be interested in the results of Smith-Hatch's work.
It entails gathering data needed to assess economic and other impacts of the salmon plan and studying potential salmon habitat on the section of river in Maine and its tributaries.
"I'm a neutral party," she said.
Violette's work also put her in a new setting. Her prior job was doing immunology research in a lab. This year she'll go out into communities to provide water-quality education to local officials, lakeside landowners, students and others.
The USDA also has Public Lands and Environment and Anti-Hunger and Empowerment Teams elsewhere in the country.
Making Portland safer
The largest AmeriCorps team in Maine was assigned to the Portland area. Sponsored by the Portland West Neighborhood Planning Council/Community Employment Project, Portland Youth for Public Safety will comprise 25 young adults, mostly in their 20s and 30s. Their aim is to prevent crime by getting at its roots.
The program has two main components, according to Director Neil Taliento. One will involve working with up to 100 first-time juvenile offenders this year who will be referred to the program by probation officers, police, the court system, and district attorneys.
The idea is to give the young offenders a chance to do community service as an alternative to jail or the youth center.
"Most of them are young people who have made a mistake," Taliento said. "This is a viable and cost-effective way to work with them."
While the concept isn't new to the Portland area, the peer assistance aspect AmeriCorps' young people will bring to it is, Taliento said. AmeriCorps workers will place, supervise and monitor the youths sentenced to work.
The other component of the public safety program centers on mediating conflicts in low-income neighborhoods before they escalate to the point where crimes are committed.
The team will schedule mediation sessions on "neutral turf" under the guidance of skilled professionals in an effort to resolve conflicts before they get out of hand, Taliento said. The goal is 100 mediations this year.
AmeriCorps members will receive training in mediation, conflict resolution and victim assistance. They will work in partnership with police, the Portland Housing Authority, public schools and other entities.
"It can work," Taliento said.
Migrant, seasonal farmworkers
The smallest AmeriCorps team -- at two members -- will be brought on board shortly, said Director Jack Frost of the Training and Development Corp.'s Career Advancement Program.
The TDC received funding for two posts from the American Association of Farmworkers Opportunity Program, which received a grant from the new federal service corporation.
After completing training, the two will travel around Maine educating seasonal and migrant farmworkers on how to reduce exposure to pesticides in berry, broccoli and potato fields, apple orchards and other farm industries that use them.
The AmeriCorps staff also will steer farmworkers to the health, educational and other support services available to them.
Addressing human needs
Nineteen AmeriCorps members are assigned to 10 projects run by Volunteers in Service to America, which has been brought under the AmeriCorps umbrella.
The projects range from addressing housing problems and homelessness and illiteracy to AIDS/HIV awareness and education, conservation and youth programs, assisting refugees and economic development, said Lisa Conley. Conley is assistant to Mary Pelky, state program director for the Corporation for National and Community Service and a non-voting member of the new state commission.
Pelky's Portland office will oversee VISTA members assigned to various locations in Maine. Among VISTA's projects are a building materials bank in Gray offering low-cost materials to low-income people; Waterville's Day Spring AIDS Support Group; a program that teaches low-income families in Washington County budgeting and living skills; Literacy Volunteers of America tutor training and the Displaced Homemakers Project.
AmeriCorps Pledge
"I will get things done for America -- to make people safer, smarter and healthier. I will bring Americans together to strengthen communities.
Faced with apathy, I will take action. Faced with conflict, I will seek common ground. Faced with adversity, I will persevere.
I will carry this commitment with me this year and beyond. I am an AmeriCorps Member. And I'm going to get things done."

Abstract: Although the validity of a referendum is now being questioned by opponents, it appears likely Thomaston voters will be asked Nov. 8 to pass judgment on three options for waste-water treatment: upgrading the existing plant and continuing to discharge treated waste water into the St. George River; building an aerated lagoon system between the Oyster River and Beechwood Street and discharging year round into the St. George; and building the aerated lagoons, with the treated water sprayed on land most of the year and discharged into the river in the winter. [Shirley Wooster] said the town could upgrade its existing waterfront treatment plant for a fraction of the cost, "but a group with a lot of clout wants it off of the waterfront and have convinced the selectmen land-spreading is the only way. The odor from the plant now is only because it's not being operated properly. Other towns upgrade the plants and discharge into the water. Thomaston seems to be the only town that can't."

Full text: THOMASTON -- A group of residents are ready to do battle with town officials over whether a waste-water treatment plan is too expensive, unnecessary and possibly illegal.
Although the validity of a referendum is now being questioned by opponents, it appears likely Thomaston voters will be asked Nov. 8 to pass judgment on three options for waste-water treatment: upgrading the existing plant and continuing to discharge treated waste water into the St. George River; building an aerated lagoon system between the Oyster River and Beechwood Street and discharging year round into the St. George; and building the aerated lagoons, with the treated water sprayed on land most of the year and discharged into the river in the winter.
The third choice is recommended by the Board of Selectmen, the sewer advisory committee and the budget committee. It is opposed by a group calling itself Thomaston Residents for Responsible Government, which says the land-spreading component would gobble up 175 acres of valuable wildlife habitat north and east of Studley Lane, in violation of the federal Natural Resources Protection Act and the town's own comprehensive plan.
The town is under a consent order from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to end waste-water discharges that harm shellfish habitat. Shirley Wooster, a spokesman for the residents group, said Friday the land-spreading not only would destroy land that should be preserved, but also would make uninhabitable adjacent residential land.
"We are a land-poor town," she said. "There isn't much available for our children to build homes and no one's going to want to build on land next to a sewer treatment lagoon. The selectmen aren't looking into the future."
Wooster said the town could upgrade its existing waterfront treatment plant for a fraction of the cost, "but a group with a lot of clout wants it off of the waterfront and have convinced the selectmen land-spreading is the only way. The odor from the plant now is only because it's not being operated properly. Other towns upgrade the plants and discharge into the water. Thomaston seems to be the only town that can't."
The selectmen received a petition in August signed by 150 residents wanting a special town meeting on the options. Unhappy with the wording of the referendum ballot, the group withdrew its petition this week.
The ballot treats each option separately and gives the selectmen the right to choose a winner should two or more receive approval.
"Presumably, we have a democratic system of government," Wooster said, "but there's nothing democratic about a confusing ballot that lets the selectmen make the final decision. We asked for a choice and we've been denied that. The town says we're misinformed. We are very much informed. If we go ahead with this, our great-grandchildren won't be out of debt."
Town Manager Valmore Blastow said Friday that while the lagoon-land spreading option has the highest total cost, about $11 million, it is the only one eligible for federal and state grants, giving it the lowest local cost.
"The local cost would be about $5.2 million, compared to $6.5 million and $7.3 million for the others," Blastow said. "The DEP has made it very clear, in letter after letter, that it is the only option that appears to be legally, technically and economically feasible."
Blastow said the charge that the plan would violate federal law and town ordinances "assumes that we have a specific site picked out. That is not the case, it's putting the cart before the horse. Right now, we're just looking at a general area. After we get approval from the voters, we can then move into the site-plan process for an exact location. We may in the future run into problems with the federal law, but our main concern right now is staying in compliance with a consent order from the DEP and the attorney general."
The town attorney is researching whether the withdrawal of the petition asking for a vote requires a cancellation of the referendum, but Blastow said townspeople should assume for now that the vote will take place.

Mussel shell find hopeful

Abstract: The dwarf wedge mussel, which once ranged from Canada to Virginia is now found only in a scattering of spots, including a stretch of river used as a recharge area for the drinking water supply in the city of Keene, N.H., she said. A brisk battle has erupted over the past two years over attempts from the city of Wilson, N.C., to expand a drinking water reservoir to encompass a creek containing the mussels.

Full text: NORTHAMPTON, Mass. -- A shell from a rare mussel believed to have disappeared from Massachusetts waters has been found in a pristine stretch of the Mill River.
The discovery raises hopes about the condition of the waterway, because the dwarf wedge mussel is extremely sensitive to chemical and other pollution, biologists said Thursday. But that enthusiasm was tempered by their inability to find any live specimens of the mussel, considered an endangered species by the federal government.
"It was a tremendous letdown," said Susi vonOettingen, an endangered species specialist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's regional office in Hadley. "Five of us spent four hours searching the river and we didn't find a live one. We think they are there, but not in any numbers."
"The habitat looks good, and they may be recovering," she said of the Connecticut River tributary that is host to at least eight other rare species. "But it may also be an old population whose ability to reproduce has been knocked out by past abuses."
Researchers suspect the little mollusks, which are only 1 1/2 to 2 inches long as adults, have a life expectancy of about 14 years, a short time when compared to some other fresh-water mussels that can live for up to 90 years, she said. And, because, they feed by siphoning nutrients from the water, they are particularly susceptible to sediment.
"They can literally suffocate," vanOettingen said. Sediment also disrupts their ability to breed, and kills the young. After hatching, the larvae attach themselves to a common fish called the tessellated darter. When they drop off several weeks later they are a microscopic version of the adult and spend the next two years burrowing in the stream bottom, she said.
The dwarf wedge mussel, which once ranged from Canada to Virginia is now found only in a scattering of spots, including a stretch of river used as a recharge area for the drinking water supply in the city of Keene, N.H., she said. A brisk battle has erupted over the past two years over attempts from the city of Wilson, N.C., to expand a drinking water reservoir to encompass a creek containing the mussels.

Mom touts safety course for divers Mandatory course could have saved son's life, Portland woman says

Abstract: Maxwell doesn't buy into those objections. She said Wednesday the course was "extremely thorough and comprehensive. It was very pertinent to everything divers and tenders do, especially the CPR and first aid components. Tenders have a lot of responsibilities out there; this prepares them for anything that could happen. With divers having to go out farther and to dive deeper to find urchins, the information on decompression is very important." Like most urchin divers, his only training was open-water certification, intended for recreational divers. "He was very well-trained, he had an excellent instructor, but it just wasn't adequate for the conditions urchin divers work in," Maxwell said. "The part of the course emphasizing a dive plan -- knowing where the divers will be located, how long they'll be on the bottom, their proximity to the tender -- could have prevented his death."

Full text: PORTLAND -- Critics of the new state law requiring a safety course for urchin and scallop divers should talk to Nancy Maxwell of Portland. She took the course last week and says it could have saved her son's life.
A registered nurse, Maxwell didn't need to take the three-day course at Southern Maine Technical College -- she only wanted the extra training to pursue her hobby of underwater archaeology.
Her son, David, was 25 when he drowned last Nov. 3 while harvesting urchins in Biddeford Pool. It was only his second commercial dive.
That was one of six diving deaths in Maine in the last year and prompted the Legislature to pass a law making the safety course mandatory for all shellfish divers and tender operators. Only those who have completed the course will receive 1995 licenses from the Department of Marine Resources.
The law has been blasted by many in the industry as unnecessary, inconvenient and, at $170, too expensive.
Maxwell doesn't buy into those objections. She said Wednesday the course was "extremely thorough and comprehensive. It was very pertinent to everything divers and tenders do, especially the CPR and first aid components. Tenders have a lot of responsibilities out there; this prepares them for anything that could happen. With divers having to go out farther and to dive deeper to find urchins, the information on decompression is very important."
To those who say they get all the training they need on the job, Maxwell said, "I wish them well. I'm a nurse, I work in a high-risk, highly regulated industry, and I appreciate all the training I can get."
David Maxwell drowned at Fortunes Rocks in Biddeford Pool after he became entangled in the rope tied to his urchin bag. He tried to swim to the tender, but got caught in heavy surf.
Like most urchin divers, his only training was open-water certification, intended for recreational divers.
"He was very well-trained, he had an excellent instructor, but it just wasn't adequate for the conditions urchin divers work in," Maxwell said. "The part of the course emphasizing a dive plan -- knowing where the divers will be located, how long they'll be on the bottom, their proximity to the tender -- could have prevented his death."
Maxwell said many of her classmates came in as skeptics and left as believers. "A lot of them were suspicious at first, but everyone I talked to came away impressed. They covered so much material, everyone learned something valuable."
The DMR reported early this month that enrollment for the course was shockingly low. Of the nearly 3,000 divers and tenders licensed this year, only 50 had signed up for the course.
John Fetterman, the department's search and rescue coordinator, said Tuesday word that the DMR intends to enforce the law to the letter has had the desired effect -- enrollment has exploded to nearly 1,000 in the past two weeks.
The increased enrollment has allowed the DMR to answer one criticism of the program, that the course locations at technical college campuses are inconvenient.
"We've said all along that we'll be able to add sections and locations as enrollment picks up, and that's just what we're doing," Fetterman said.

Abstract: Two Lubec Middle School teachers and their pupils were honored Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Schoodic Chapter of the National Audubon Society for a continuing water quality study they initiated on Johnson's Bay and Lubec Narrows. In conducting the study, pupils gathered data through various tests and developed theories about the effects of human habitation on coastal ecology in the Lubec area. The project included controlled experiments conducted by the pupils either to prove or disprove their theories.

Full text: CALAIS -- Two Lubec Middle School teachers and their pupils were honored Tuesday at the annual meeting of the Schoodic Chapter of the National Audubon Society for a continuing water quality study they initiated on Johnson's Bay and Lubec Narrows.
The teachers -- Marty Mahar and Rose Binder -- launched the project in 1993. The initial study combined math and science classes in studies of local water quality, and involved all sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders at the school.
Sid Bahrt, one of 130 members of the local Audubon Society chapter, praised Binda, Mahar and their pupils for their conservation effort on Wednesday.
"It is outstanding what these two teachers and their students have done," he said. "It's an outstanding achievement and speaks well for their school."
The teachers were presented with the chapter's annual Conservation Award Tuesday night in Calais during the group's annual awards supper and meeting. They received a framed photo of a kestrel -- a sparrow hawk -- taken by Bahrt and hand-lettered by Nellie Walton of Calais.
Bahrt said what made the water quality study project unique was that it is ____________________________________________________________________ ___________an ongoing project. "We found that particularly interesting," he added. ____________________________________________________________________ ________ In June, the teachers and their pupils learned that the project had been selected by Anheuser-Busch as a finalist for its annual "Pledge and a Promise" environmental award.
Anheuser-Busch presents its Pledge and a Promise environmental award in recognition of school groups making lasting contributions to the environment.
In conducting the study, pupils gathered data through various tests and developed theories about the effects of human habitation on coastal ecology in the Lubec area. The project included controlled experiments conducted by the pupils either to prove or disprove their theories.
Binder said that earlier in the course of their study, the pupils developed an interest in local shellfish stocks and initiated a population study of clams in South Lubec.
"They have contacted municipal officials to try to develop a management plan for the flats," Binder said, adding that programs undertaken by the pupils as part of the study "have become an integral part of the math and science curriculum in the Middle School."
Funding for the project included a $12,000 grant from the GTE Foundation's Growth Initiatives for Teachers Program. With only 330 students, the Lubec school was the smallest of about 60 schools nationwide to receive a GTE award last year. About 90 pupils were involved in the initial study.

Abstract: Before switching to oyster research in 1986, [Robert Hawes] was the university's expert on chicken breeding. The growth of aquaculture and a sharp decline in Maine's broiler industry led Hawes to switch his focus to shellfish. Mounds of shells in some coastal areas show that oysters were once abundant in Maine, according to Hawes. The combination of overfishing and pollution destroyed most of the large oyster colonies, but a wild bed remains in the Sheepscot River. In addition to growing oysters on river bottoms, Hawes and other researchers are studying the potential for "polyculture" -- growing the shellfish in mesh bags hung on salmon pens. It could be another source of income for Maine's salmon farmers, without requiring much investment of time or money.

Full text: ORONO -- Charisma isn't on the Top 10 list of oyster attributes.
They sit on the bottom, year after year, filtering algae from the water and slowly growing larger.
When the time is right, they release clouds of eggs and sperm. A new generation swims off for a few weeks of freedom, then sinks to the bottom and begins to filter algae from the water.
"Even the scallop is more interesting," admits Robert Hawes, an expert on oyster breeding at the University of Maine. "These things just sit there. Someone once told me it was like breeding rocks."
Still, Hawes is the man that Maine oyster growers hope will develop faster growing, tastier and more disease-resistant shellfish.
Before switching to oyster research in 1986, Hawes was the university's expert on chicken breeding. The growth of aquaculture and a sharp decline in Maine's broiler industry led Hawes to switch his focus to shellfish.
"Maine has all the attributes (for successful oyster farming)," said Hawes. "It has almost 4,000 miles of coastline, some of the cleanest water on the East Coast, and it's near the major markets."
Despite the natural advantages, Maine's cultivated oyster industry is very small -- only five companies on the Damariscotta River.
"It's an excellent growing area," said Hawes. "The water temperatures are warm for Maine, which results in faster growth."
Mounds of shells in some coastal areas show that oysters were once abundant in Maine, according to Hawes. The combination of overfishing and pollution destroyed most of the large oyster colonies, but a wild bed remains in the Sheepscot River.
Oysters can't be grown in the open ocean. The best commercial sites are protected inlets with a good supply of algae and clean sea water.
Growers usually buy oyster larvae -- called spat -- from one of two Maine hatcheries and grow the shellfish in floating trays the first year. The trays protect oysters from crabs, starfish, snails and other predators.
Oysters are set on the bottom at the start of the second growing season and remain there until harvested about 18 months later.
The shellfish only grow from April to October, according to Hawes. After three growing seasons, they are at least 2 inches long and ready to be sold to restaurants for use raw "on the half-shell."
Good oysters -- those with attractive rounded shells and uniform sizes -- can be sold for 35 to 45 cents each, according to Hawes.
In addition to growing oysters on river bottoms, Hawes and other researchers are studying the potential for "polyculture" -- growing the shellfish in mesh bags hung on salmon pens. It could be another source of income for Maine's salmon farmers, without requiring much investment of time or money.
"The initial research is promising," said Hawes. "It appears that the oysters are capturing excess feed from the salmon pens, or that salmon feces stimulates algae growth in the pen."
Hawes and a colleague, Bruce Barber, also are trying to breed improved strains of shellfish. They are experimenting with oysters that have three complete sets of genes -- one from the father and two from the mother.
The extra set of genes makes the shellfish sterile, which improves quality. After spawning, oyster meat can be tasteless and watery for some time. The "triploid" oysters also seem to grow faster than native stock, according to Hawes.
"The genetically improved stock we produced and performed better than wild stock out of the (Damariscotta) river," he said. "It has been used commercially for two years, and it does seem to be doing better, both in the rate of growth and mortality."
Despite the modest research success, Hawes still has a tender spot in his heart for his former feathered friends. He raises bantam fowl at home and keeps a stuffed chicken next to the oyster shells in his office.
Although shellfish lack the personality of chickens, Hawes said, his work is not without rewards.
"On a summer day, it's a lot nicer on the river than it is in a hot, dusty chicken barn," he said.

Shortnose sturgeon at center of debate on damming rivers

Abstract: The petitioner, Edwards Manufacturing Co. of Augusta, asks for "delisting" the fish only in the Kennebec System, which includes the Kennebec, Androscoggin and Sheepscot rivers. The company owns and operates Edwards Dam on the Kennebec. Though its hydropower license expired last December, the company continues to operate the dam under a one-year extension while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviews its relicensing application. "Based on the abundance, viability, and distribution of the Kennebec System shortnose sturgeon population, as documented by studies over the period 1977 through 1994, it appears virtually certain that the original listing as endangered was in error, and that this conservative approach (i.e. listing) was taken because of a lack of scientific study and commercial data rather than a true paucity of fish," according to the petition, which was prepared by Northrop, Devine and Tarbell, a Portland firm providing engineering and environmental services. "The shortnose sturgeon population in the Kennebec and Androscoggin system was studied intensely from 1977 to 1981. Population estimates for that period averaged 10,000 adults. The spawning, feeding and overwintering habitats in the Kennebec are known, and they face few adverse impacts from development," the authors at NMFS said.

Full text: The population of shortnose sturgeon in the Kennebec River is so healthy that it does not warrant protection under the federal Endangered Species Act, according to a citizen-sponsored petition.
The petitioner, Edwards Manufacturing Co. of Augusta, asks for "delisting" the fish only in the Kennebec System, which includes the Kennebec, Androscoggin and Sheepscot rivers. The company owns and operates Edwards Dam on the Kennebec. Though its hydropower license expired last December, the company continues to operate the dam under a one-year extension while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviews its relicensing application.
"The shortnose could be a stumbling block for relicensing. But it's not the biggest hurdle. Politics is," said Mark Isaccson, vice president of the company.
The dam is the first obstacle on the river for fish migrating upstream. Gov. John R. McKernan and a variety of conservation groups have called for removal of the dam to restore the fishery.
Neither side calls the shortnose sturgeon a make-or-break issue. But opponents of the dam have rallied around the fish.
"They (sturgeon) need the dam removed to restore their native habitat," said Margaret Bowman, of American Rivers, a national organization fighting to restore and preserve river systems.
As part of the Kennebec Coalition, American Rivers has been fighting for years to have the dam removed. At the same time, the group is working on a national level to see a policy established that would give FERC clear authority to order the decommissioning and removal of dams.
Bowman said her group just wanted the policy changed and didn't really care whether it was the Edwards case or another that established the precedent for such change.
Isaacson, the vice president of Edwards, sees American Rivers in a different light.
"They are very interested in establishing a precedent for dam removal," he said. "The dams they really want to remove are not on the Kennebec but in the Pacific Northwest and they thought we'd be a good place to begin. We're a small, private company with four employees."
In the course of preparing the application to FERC, the company compiled reams of information on the shortnose sturgeon.
The fish, whose range extends along the Atlantic Seaboard from New Brunswick to Florida, was placed on the original endangered species list in 1967. Adult shortnose sturgeon, which grow as long as three feet and as heavy as 20 pounds, are the smallest of the three species in eastern North America.
They feed on mollusks, crustaceans and insect larvae in the mud and gravel of river bottoms. They spawn in freshwater, where they remain as juveniles. On becoming adults they migrate seasonally from wintering areas in the saline parts of the lower river to the spring spawning areas upstream.
"Based on the abundance, viability, and distribution of the Kennebec System shortnose sturgeon population, as documented by studies over the period 1977 through 1994, it appears virtually certain that the original listing as endangered was in error, and that this conservative approach (i.e. listing) was taken because of a lack of scientific study and commercial data rather than a true paucity of fish," according to the petition, which was prepared by Northrop, Devine and Tarbell, a Portland firm providing engineering and environmental services.
Normally, the instigation to remove species from the list comes from the government itself. And in this case, Edwards' petition cited a review of the shortnose sturgeon prepared by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 1987. The review recommended that the fish in the Kennebec System be delisted.
"The shortnose sturgeon population in the Kennebec and Androscoggin system was studied intensely from 1977 to 1981. Population estimates for that period averaged 10,000 adults. The spawning, feeding and overwintering habitats in the Kennebec are known, and they face few adverse impacts from development," the authors at NMFS said.
"Therefore, we believe the shortnose sturgeon in the Kennebec System is not in danger of extinction or likely to become endangered now, or in the foreseeable future, and can be removed from the list of endangered species."
But the service never followed through on its recommendation. When the proposal was made available for public comment, nearly all of it was unfavorable.
"The view was that it was inappropriate to go forward without any long-term data," said Douglas Beach, an endangered-species specialist with NMFS. "There were a lot of quick and dirty studies from which we could infer that (the Kennebec population) was healthy. But it's a slow-going, long-lived fish. You really need years of data before you can say it's a healthy population."
At the state level, Tom Squires, at the Department of Marine Resources, has studied the sturgeon off and on since 1977.
"On the Kennebec, my feeling is that we don't have all the information yet," he said. "Definitely there's a large population of sturgeon." He added that more information is needed about exactly where the fish spend their winters, where they spawn and what stretch of river serves as a nursery.
Once it receives the petition, the federal agency has 90 days to determine whether the petition has merit.

Abstract: Of the 11 species of mussels known to be in Maine, the stretch of river in northern Knox County contains six or seven; freshwater mussels are not well-researched creatures, so no one knows exactly. What biologists do know is the river contains two mussels that are candidates for protection under state and federal endangered species acts -- the yellow lamp and brook floater. The two mussels are in the pipeline of consideration for endangered status like a much more publicized species, the Atlantic salmon. The mussels are classified Category 2, candidates that may warrant listing but further information is required. With salmon, officials are just about through gathering information and must report their recommendation by Oct. 1. Officials are anxious to avoid a replay with mussels. Maine's commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Ray "Bucky" Owen, has already talked with landowners with property along rivers in Down East Maine that are home to the yellow lamp and brook floater mussels.

Full text: It's hard to search for freshwater mussels and paddle a canoe at the same time.
Peering down too intently into the stream looking for mussels in the gravelly bed increases the likelihood of not seeing the rock lurking beneath the surface and adding another scratch to the canoe bottom. Concentrating on the waters up ahead means missing mussels.
Finding mussels was the reason for spending a sunny day on the St. George River, so the three biologists from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife put up with their canoes getting dinged now and again.
Of the 11 species of mussels known to be in Maine, the stretch of river in northern Knox County contains six or seven; freshwater mussels are not well-researched creatures, so no one knows exactly. What biologists do know is the river contains two mussels that are candidates for protection under state and federal endangered species acts -- the yellow lamp and brook floater.
After tying the canoes to streamside alders, the crew wades in shallows, stooping over glass-bottomed buckets searching the stream bed.
Mussels live a sedentary life. They stay anchored to the bottom, in some cases for as long as 100 years, filtering food from the water. Adult females spew millions of larvae, which must latch on to a fish to survive. For a few weeks they draw sustenance from their host before dropping off. They sink to the stream bed, burrow in and mature without moving too far.
Mark McCollough holds up a yellow lamp. Finding one is an acquired knack. Only a small slit of gill structure shows above the sand and gravel. The rest of it is anchored in the substrate. Keel Kemper slogs over holding a caliper. The shell is 83.7 millimeters long, nearly 3 1/2 inches. For perhaps 35 years that mussel has lived in the same spot.
"Probably of all the mussels in Maine, this is the most distinctive and a candidate for the federal endangered list," McCollough said. "The (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) is waiting for a summary of research on its status. A lot of what we're doing is gathering evidence to support moving it up or taking it off the list."
The two mussels are in the pipeline of consideration for endangered status like a much more publicized species, the Atlantic salmon. The mussels are classified Category 2, candidates that may warrant listing but further information is required. With salmon, officials are just about through gathering information and must report their recommendation by Oct. 1.
As a high-profile species, one the biologists call "charismatic," the salmon has received far more attention and money. McCollough and a colleague will spend about $10,000, $9,500 from the federal government, learning more about mussels in Maine. Research on Atlantic salmon in Maine will consume hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Ecosystems, not just species
The yellow lamp and brook floater require the same type of freshwater habitat that Atlantic salmon need, clean flowing water and a bed of sandy gravel. And the changes wrought by man harm both.
Over the years millions of dollars has been poured into the restoration effort for salmon, including the stocking of fry, habitat improvement and efforts to improve water quality. Precious little has been spent on mussels.
Stream beds cannot support healthy mussel populations and the waters no longer support strong salmon runs. Biologists have long advocated that it is time to move beyond the crisis management by species and to work on the system they inhabit. The bureaucracy is moving to embrace the change.
"In a nutshell, what we are talking about is more efficiently and effectively conserving our nation's plant and animal diversity through perpetuation of dynamic, healthy ecosystems," Mollie Beattie, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said last June during a speech in Orono at the convention of the Outdoor Writers Association of America.
"This means going beyond restoring or conserving a single species or a small group of species, and looking to take action that will restore and conserve all species in a given ecosystem," she said. "It also means looking beyond species themselves to the habitat they live in and determining how best we can restore and conserve that habitat."
She went on to say, "... the problems brought to light by the Endangered Species Act are far deeper than just the decline of a single species. Inevitably, endangered species indicate a problem in the natural ecosystem that, left unadressed, will ultimately affect people. They are signs of pollution and overuse of resources. Furthermore, they indicate that the economic or other activities causing the decline of the species cannot continue indefinitely. When growth is of a nature, speed, and scope that it pushes species to extinction and results in the unraveling of ecosystems, it cannot be sustained for very long."
The well-detailed activities that led to the decline of salmon contributed to the decline of mussels.
Mussels in decline
"Freshwater mussels are in trouble because pollution, dams and other water-control structures, channelization, dredging, and sedimentation of our once clean, free-flowing rivers and streams have all contributed to the degradation and loss of mussel habitat," Beth Swartz, a biologist with Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, wrote in a soon-to-be-published article.
The range of both the yellow lamp and brook floater extend from Maine south to the mid-Atlantic states. Both are scarce in the southern part of their range, where habitat destruction is more extensive.
Sitting in the bow of one of the canoes on the St. George, Swartz took a break from looking down past the gunwale. "We're looking on this river for sites where we could establish baseline data," she said. "We're just looking to find populations. Next season we hope to return to do a more thorough survey."
Biologists do not know all the populations of mussels in Maine's streams and rivers, ponds and lakes, let alone have baselines to know whether the numbers are growing or shrinking. The department started surveying mussels two years ago, with support from the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Before research started in Maine, the brook floater was known to live in six rivers and no more than three individuals had been found at any one site. The yellow lamp was documented at 10 locations.
Since then, Inland Fisheries and Wildlife biologists have searched more than 200 sites in more than 90 streams and rivers. The brook floater turned up in an additional 10 rivers, a few of which had healthy populations.
"Compared to most states within the range of these two species, Maine seems to have the best remaining populations and may be the last stronghold for these rare mussels," Swartz wrote.
Biologists suspect Maine may be an outpost of another mussel, the dwarf wedge, which is on the federal endangered list. It has been found in New Hampshire and New Brunswick but not in the waters of Maine.
With more biologists looking, new populations of mussels continue being discovered. In New Hampshire, an environmental biology student recently found a new colony of dwarf wedge mussels.
The little mollusk had held up a $35 million expansion of the Buckhorn Reservoir in Wilson, N.C., until biologists started searching and found more than 20 colonies.
The dwarf wedge mussel may have benefited from the intense interest in this case. But biologists are sounding the alarm for the 297 kinds of mussels found in the United States. Of the recognized species and subspecies, 21 are presumed extinct, 56 are federally listed as threatened or endangered and 69 are candidates for listing.
"...(W)e must argue their case based on sheer numbers in decline and their utility as indicators of environmental degradation. Water quality and the biological integrity of river systems are essential to the health, economic prosperity and long-term survival of humans," Richard J. Neeves, a renowned mussel specialist, said in a symposium two years ago.
Worries over status
Narrowing the field from 297 to two, the brook floater and yellow lamp, Paul Nickerson, an endangered species specialist with the Fish and Wildlife Service, said, "It looks like they'll be left in Category 2. At this point, it doesn't look like there's the data to support moving forward. There's new populations discovered in Maine. We feel there's no imminent threat to either (species). But we'll keep gathering information from throughout their range."
The likelihood of listing may have decreased, but some people still worry about the reprecussions of adding two more species to the 18 in Maine already federally listed as threatened or endangered.
Shortly after work started on whether salmon should be listed, the Maine Forest Products Council organized an "awareness workshop." It attracted more than 200 people. They were worried the Atlantic salmon could become the spotted owl of Maine.
Officials are anxious to avoid a replay with mussels. Maine's commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Ray "Bucky" Owen, has already talked with landowners with property along rivers in Down East Maine that are home to the yellow lamp and brook floater mussels.
Mussels are unlikely to generate much interest let alone hysteria, unless they hold up construction of a resevoir. In the minds of most people mussels are good for little, which dismays of biologists studying them. They aren't even edible.
"I've tried them boiled through five changes of water. I've tried them fried in batter. And they still taste like an old rubber band," Kemper said while paddling through a quiet pool on the St. George.

Gulf of Maine is a biological nightmare

Author: Carter, Jonathan

Abstract: The Gulf of Maine because of unusual dynamic is considered one of the richest fisheries in the world. Fish landings have consistently declined over the last decade. The decrease is due to the degradation of the ecosystem by destructive fishing techniques, coastal development, and pollution. The decline in landings endangers the traditional fishing industry in Maine. Clearly fishing needs to be regulated and stocks need to be given time to rebuild. The New England Fishery Management Council's efforts to reduce fishing pressure by 50 percent in order to restore cod and flounder stocks within five years and haddock within 10 years is an achievable goal. We need to outlaw rapacious and destructive factory fishing such as pair trawling and dragging. Gill netting must be regulated to protect marine mammals with sonar locators on all nets, to reduce by-catch and juvenile stock by increasing mess size, and to restrict nets from anadromous migratory fish paths. In addition, increasing the legal size limit and closing off areas to protect juvenile fish would help to restore small independent fishing families is totally unacceptable. These families make a significant contribution to the unique character and economic well-being of the state. Limiting fishing days is not a solution or setting quotas based on previous catches. These regulations would effectively drive the small fishing boat out of business while allowing the big businesses to continue in their efforts to monopolize control of the Gulf of Maine fishery.

Full text: The food web is unraveling and the ocean inhabitants of the Gulf of Maine are sending clear messages of impending disaster. The crisis is real. The gulf is under siege from overfishing and the dumping of industrial wastes, untreated sewage, pesticide runoff, oil spills, and other discarded human toxins. Fish catches have dropped precipitously, and recent studies have found PCBs, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, dioxins, and excess nitrogen all along the Maine coast.
Although the Gulf of Maine is not yet on a par with the ecological deterioration found in such places as Chesapeake Bay or Boston Harbor, it is apparent that something must be done at once before it is too late. The oceans should never have been and can no longer be considered as a bottomless food supply or as a limitless disposal site. We call for an immediate unprecedented local, state, and national cooperative effort to assay the biological health of the Gulf of Maine.

These regulations would effectively drive the small fishing boat out of business while allowing the big businesses to continue in their efforts to monopolize control of the Gulf of Maine fishery.
If the fisheries are to recover we also have to stem the tide of coastal development that has allowed coastal estuaries and marshes to be destroyed. These areas provide critical spawning ground for all our commercially important fish species. Many of the spawning sites are suffering as a result of the deforestation of the headwaters of our rivers. Deforestation results in excessive run-off which causes the destructive flooding of saline spawning grounds with fresh water.
In addition to habitat destruction, evidence suggests that years of massive pollution are taking their toll. Cancers, reproductive damage, genetic alterations, and immune suppression symptoms are occurring with greater frequency in ocean vertebrate populations. The fish in Casco Bay have the highest lead concentration yet recorded anywhere along the eastern seaboard.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), a compound that causes birth defects and learning disorders in children, has been found in lobsters and shellfish. The most carcinogenic substance known to science, dioxin, produced by paper manufacturers "up river" is showing up in coastal marine environments. Our bald eagles and lobsters have been contaminated. PCB and dioxin, like many other toxins, bioaccumulate in fatty tissue as they move up the food chain. It is more than apparent that the time has come to take immediate action in banning the flow of all toxins into the ocean. Once again, this will take all levels of cooperation from the individual to the global community.
The biological health of the Gulf of Maine is in jeopardy. Either we take the steps now to ensure its restoration or we will no longer have the bounty of its gifts in both economic and nutrition terms. As governor, I will work to accomplish the following tasks:
1. Create a toxics task force whose sole purpose will be to eliminate all point and non-point sources of pollution entering the Gulf of Maine.
2. Increase funding for the Department of Marine Resources for research and educational outreach.
3. Eliminate dioxin as a by-product of paper production.
4. Expand development of aquaculture in the areas of seaweed, shellfish, and finfish where appropriate.
5. Create marine santuaries to protect juvenile fish stocks and other marine organisms.
6. Develop with the Coastal Land Use Commission with the Office of Comprehensive Planning whose task will be to oversee coastal development and to aid municipalities in protecting coastal resources.
7. Assist in the local development of land trusts both for land protetion and low-income housing.
8.Increase sustainable economic development by expanding port opportunities in Eastport, Portland, and Mack Point, establishing ferry service from Eastport from Nova Scotia, and supporting ecotourism and recreation as small business endeavors.
The restoration of the oceans will provide a sustainable future both in ecological and economic terms for generations to come. I ask for your vote so that I may help initiate this vision.
Jonathan Carter is the Green Parety candidate for governor.

Full text: President Clinton may take a side trip to Maine on Labor Day during his late-summer vacation at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., published reports said Monday.
Clinton would attend a rally at Bath Iron Works, Maine's largest employer, that recently signed a novel labor agreement with its workers.
The president also may visit a YMCA camp near Augusta to attend a Labor Day picnic with host Joseph Brennan, a former two-term governor who is the Democratic nominee in this year's gubernatorial race.
At a stop in Bangor, Sen. George Mitchell confirmed a report that Clinton was considering stopping in Maine over Labor Day weekend.
Mitchell said he received a call from the White House a week ago and was told the president was considering several locations for a Labor Day speech.
One of those locations being considered is Maine, most likely at Bath Iron Works, said the senator.
"There has been no decision made at this time. Several locations are under consideration, including Maine," Mitchell said.
The president and his wife have been staying since Friday at the Oyster Pond estate of Richard Friedman, a Democratic fund-raiser and friend of Clinton's. They are expected to end their Martha's Vineyard vacation Sept. 7.
BIW, a shipbuilding company that has long relied on Navy contracts, is striving to break into the commercial market as the government scales back defense spending.
A Pentagon official last week suggested the possibility of further cuts in the Navy's destroyer program, a move that could weaken or even force the closing of BIW over the next decade.
The company's largest union's membership earlier this month ratified a contract that creates a new "team" approach to shipbuilding, which is designed to make the company more competitive and run more efficiently.
Instead of continuing the practice of workers concentrating on just one trade, pay increases during the three-year contract will hinge on a worker's skill level in a number of crafts. Workers and managers will share the responsibility for major decisions about the company's future.
Employees who diversify their talents through retraining will be rewarded.
Clinton would be expected to bring national attention to the new labor agreement if he visits Maine next week.
"We'd welcome the visit," said BIW's chief executive officer, Duane "Buzz" Fitzgerald.

Unsung Dungeness crab preferred to Maine lobster Washington state shellfish deserves greater exposure

Abstract: During our recent vacation trip to Maine, we consumed lobsters singly, in pairs and in lobster rolls. We were also offered the opportunity to partake of lobster pizza in Camden, lobster ice cream in Bar Harbor and we very nearly succumbed. You see, from the moment you arrive on the coast of Maine until you take your departure, you are allowed to think of very little other than lobster. Every body of water is dotted with brightly colored lobster buoys. Take a walk along a cliff in Acadia National Park and you find yourself watching lobstermen harvest the day's catch. Take a stroll across a bridge in Boothbay Harbor and you immediately spot a mother and her two sons dropping one of the family lobster traps over the side of an outboard skiff. You don't really need a recipe for Dungeness crab. If you have some live ones, you toss them into salted boiling water and cook until they rise to the top, then cool, clean, crack them and serve with melted butter or freshly made mayonnaise. (I like to add some of the orange crab butter from the body when I make the mayo in my blender.)

Full text: The first thing that happens when you cross the border into Maine is that you involuntarily suspend all of your current dietary laws and restrictions.
Next thing you know a waitress is affixing a plastic bib beneath your chin and you find yourself muttering ribald comments like "Get a load of that chick" and "Is that a `keeper' or what?!"
"Chicks" are small lobsters, also known as "keepers." Hopefully you will encounter them freshly steamed, next to a vat of melted butter. There goes your diet. There goes your newly purchased L.L. Bean sports shirt as well, unless you securely fastened your bib.
During our recent vacation trip to Maine, we consumed lobsters singly, in pairs and in lobster rolls. We were also offered the opportunity to partake of lobster pizza in Camden, lobster ice cream in Bar Harbor and we very nearly succumbed.
You see, from the moment you arrive on the coast of Maine until you take your departure, you are allowed to think of very little other than lobster. Every body of water is dotted with brightly colored lobster buoys. Take a walk along a cliff in Acadia National Park and you find yourself watching lobstermen harvest the day's catch. Take a stroll across a bridge in Boothbay Harbor and you immediately spot a mother and her two sons dropping one of the family lobster traps over the side of an outboard skiff.
Drive along U.S. 1 and you'll be offered freshly cooked lobster from giant pots bubbling next to souvenir shops, farmhouses, gas stations, general stores and even, in one instance, as part of an auto body shop. And lobster rolls are on special under the golden arches at the McDonald's outlets.
To be fair about it, Maine lobsters are terrific. But, given my choice, I would still opt for a leggy Dungeness crab.
But tourists to Washington state are not subjected to the same nonstop sales campaign that carries the economy of Maine. That's because Washingtonians are more guarded toward our regional culinary treasure. We sneak our crab pots into the waters, retrieve them furtively and certainly never lead rivals to the mother lode with a dotted line of red, yellow and glowing green buoys.
We flummox the tourists, convincing them that espresso is the regional fixation. They leave here with sacks full of Starbucks in 13 different flavors. And the natives gaily wave them out of town, then rush home to crack a few crabs we've been hiding beneath some discarded tourist posters.
You don't really need a recipe for Dungeness crab. If you have some live ones, you toss them into salted boiling water and cook until they rise to the top, then cool, clean, crack them and serve with melted butter or freshly made mayonnaise. (I like to add some of the orange crab butter from the body when I make the mayo in my blender.)
Along with chilled red wine and a crusty French bread, this is the perfect accompaniment to a crab feast.
Potato-Pea Puget Salad
1 pound frozen green peas, thawed
5 large potatoes, cooked, peeled and cubed
1 bunch green onions, chopped
4 tablespoons wine vinegar
1 clove garlic
1 tablespoon fresh oregano (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)
1 tablespoon fresh thyme (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)
Salt, pepper
1/2 cup olive oil
Tomato wedges
1 small red onion, thinly sliced
1 small green pepper, sliced into rings
Dump the spuds, peas and green onions into a bowl.
In a smaller bowl, moosh together the vinegar, garlic, herbs, salt and pepper. Beat in the olive oil. Pour this sludge over the vegetables, toss and chill.
Serve with the tomato wedges, sliced red onion and green pepper rings.
My all-time favorite splurge feast are Dungeness crab legs prepared like this.
Crab Legs Laurelhurst
60 crab legs, shelled
1/2 pound butter
1 cup dry, white wine
Sprig of rosemary
1/4 teaspoon tarragon
Pinch of thyme
2 tablespoons parsley, chopped
Cracker crumbs
Melt the butter in a saucepan with the wine and herbs. Let simmer until reduced by half, then set aside to cool slightly.
Dip each shelled crab leg into the sauce, roll in fine cracker crumbs, salting and peppering lightly. Arrange on a flat baking dish. Sprinkle a little sauce over the top, then shove under a broiler until golden. Turn, return to oven until sizzling on second side and serve. Pour the rest of the sauce through a sieve over the legs.
You say that's too rich for your diet? OK, skip the lobster ice cream cone for dessert.

Abstract: NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- With empty holds but hailed as heroes, the captains of the Alpha & Omega II and the Warrior steamed into home port Wednesday. "I feel good to be home, but I don't feel so good in the wallet," quipped Alpha & Omega II captain Charlie Rodriques, standing beside the Warrior. "It's a long ordeal, Charlie, a long ordeal," said the Warrior's skipper, Michael Willett, shaking Rodriques' hand for photo- graphers.

Full text: NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- With empty holds but hailed as heroes, the captains of the Alpha & Omega II and the Warrior steamed into home port Wednesday.
The local fishermen who stirred up a diplomatic ruckus by seeking rich scallop beds in international waters had returned.
More than 150 relatives and friends greeted the fishermen at the pier, cheering and waving as the draggers slowly sidled up to the dock. Trawlers and draggers tied up nearby blasted their horns.
"I feel good to be home, but I don't feel so good in the wallet," quipped Alpha & Omega II captain Charlie Rodriques, standing beside the Warrior.
"It's a long ordeal, Charlie, a long ordeal," said the Warrior's skipper, Michael Willett, shaking Rodriques' hand for photo- graphers.
The two men are free on $5,000 bonds pending separate trials in Newfoundland this fall. If convicted of illegal fishing, they face fines up to $750,000 apiece.
The boats were seized July 26 by Canadian authorities, who have claimed control of the shellfish beyond Canada's territorial waters. But the U.S. State Department -- and the fishermen -- say the scallops are fair game.
Rodriques, 36, of Mattapoisett, says the scallopers steamed into a trap.
"It was piracy, it was uncalled for," Rodriques said, later adding: "They had five days while we were under steam to get out there to tell us, `No, you can't fish for scallops."
The fishermen and members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation have called for sanctions against Canada. The fishermen want to boycott Canadian fish. Washington wants Canada to drop the charges and fines and to compensate the boat owners for lost time at sea.
Bob Bruno, owner of the Alpha & Omega II, said the trip cost him $10,000 in fuel alone. He shook his head when asked about the added cost of food, ice and other supplies. "Something like this can put you under," he said.
Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin has said Ottawa gave the United States ample warning that it would prosecute Americans who harvested Icelandic scallops that sit on the continental shelf outside the 200-mile territorial limit.
Ottawa claims the Icelandic scallops are sedentary and theirs to regulate under international law. Washington disagrees, saying the mollusks swim, if not that well.
Bruno said he doubts he will send the boat back to the nose of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland until the dispute is resolved.
That came as a relief to Kathy DeBarros, wife of Alpha & Omega II first mate Thomas DeBarros. "And it's a shame, too," she said. "They checked it out before going there. But the Canadians want to control everything."
Away from the cameras and the crowd, a bare-chested Jared Carney stood on the Alpha's deck, holding his 20-month-old son, Zachary, and talking to his wife, Kim, who stayed on the pier. He spoke of the morning the 95-foot dragger was seized.
"It was scary. They had M-16s and they had guns on their sides," he said. "And they're not just the Fisheries guys, they were the Canadian Navy."

Full text: SOUTHWEST HARBOR -- If he makes it to 90, and it's a wise bet that he will, Edward Murphy will set sail to Singapore on his schooner.
The 70-something sailor from Halifax, Nova Scotia, is too young to retire but old enough to dream of it. As captain of the 37-foot by 9-foot-6-inch Hebridee II, a Bluenose Junior schooner, Murphy told tales of the fog and the sea to all who came aboard this weekend.
Murphy had moored his schooner alongside the far dock at the WoodenBoat Show. It is a seaworthy craft shadowed in size, perhaps, by the bigger vessels, but richly warm in varnished mahagony and memory.
A third generation business owner in Halifax, Murphy's heart and passion lie with the sea and his 1953 William J. Roue designed boat. The father of seven, with 10 grandchildren, Murphy sailed with four others to Maine's coast where he was joined by wife Elise, who had cautiously decided to forgo the fog and traveled by land.
"I don't do boats and I don't do races," Elise laughs as she emerges from the far cabin to greet newcomers to the intimate quiet of the dining and sleeping quarters. Her passion, she says, is gardens.
"It'll sleep seven, if two know each other really well," Murphy quips, while settling in for another round of visitors at this three-day fest. In the calm of the cabin, with hundreds of feet passing by the tiny portholes, Murphy entertains with memories of races in Canadian waters from Marblehead to Halifax.
On the wall is a plaque from the American Schooner Association in 1987, a tribute, Murphy says, "for just being old and being around." But, an honor, his wife explains, for staging a festival of schooners at the waterfront.
With more than 8,000 people streaming through the WoodenBoat Show over the past three days, it was the tales of seaports and boat designs that enticed landlubbers and boatowners to step into cabins and settle into deckchairs on wooden boats of all decades and sizes.
Families piled their dogs onto schoolbuses to travel between parking lot and boat show, strapped babies into backpacks, and stepped in and out of shoes to look into and around boats.
Solo boaters settled into finely finished kayaks to ply the waters off the marina. Sailors who had moored offshore reached the show by dinghy, sharing the harbor with beefy ships such as the Invincible IV and the Principia, their captains manuevering for space in the waterways.
A show celebrating the tradition of wooden-boat craftmanship, the marina was shared by them all: the exquisite, the work horses of the sea, and even those making a comeback, such as the Chesapeake Oyster Buy Boat.
The veteran of fishing voyages since 1925, the Buy Boat is a cleaned-up boat nearly 35 feet in length, waiting for the finely tuned work of a master craftsman. Ralph Stanley of Southwest Harbor will turn the cargo hutch into a "floating condominium" for owner Holyoke Whitney.
The Murphys will float to Camden this week, enjoying the coastal Maine waters with other wooden boats that will sail away together from Southwest Harbor Monday morning in the WoodenBoat Cruise-in-(Good) Company event.
"Can one man handle this?" a visitor asks the captain.
"Well, if he's a man like me," Murphy responds, a twinkle in his eye and his weathered tan muscles flexing. But in case he needs some help on that trip to Singapore, his grandchildren are sailors in training, getting ready to follow where their granddad leads.

Abstract: The "karat" marking tells you what proportion of gold is mixed with the other metals. If 14 parts of gold are mixed with 10 parts of base metal, the combination is called 14-karat (14K) gold. The higher the karat rating, the higher the proportion of gold in the object. The lowest karat gold that can be marketed as gold in the United States is 10 karat. Jewelry does not have to be marked with its karat quality, but most of it is. If there is a karat quality mark, next to it must be the U.S. registered trademark of the person or company that will stand behind the mark, as required by the National Gold and Silver Stamping Act. "Plated," "gold-filled," "gold overlay" and "rolled gold plate" are terms used to describe jewelry that has a layer of at least 10-karat gold mechanically bonded to a base metal. If such jewelry is marked with one of these terms, the term itself must follow the karat quality of the gold used (14K gold overlay, for example). If the layer of karat gold constitutes less than 1/20th of the total weight of the object, any marking must state the actual percentage of karat gold, such as "1/40th 14K gold overlay."

Full text: When you go shopping for a piece of fine jewelry, perhaps to celebrate a special occasion, you may find yourself puzzled by terms that sales clerks use to describe gold, precious gems and watches. To help you understand the meaning of some typical terms used by the jewelry industry in its advertising, the Federal Trade Commission has shared with us the following information about fine jewelry. Although there is no commercial or legal definition for the phrase "fine jewelry," many retailers use the term to describe karat gold jewelry, gemstones and higher-priced watches.
Guidelines established by the Federal Trade Commission in cooperation with the jewelry industry state that the word "gold," used by itself, means "all gold" or 24 karat (24K) gold. Because 24K gold is soft, it usually is mixed with other metals to increase its hardness and durability.
The "karat" marking tells you what proportion of gold is mixed with the other metals. If 14 parts of gold are mixed with 10 parts of base metal, the combination is called 14-karat (14K) gold. The higher the karat rating, the higher the proportion of gold in the object. The lowest karat gold that can be marketed as gold in the United States is 10 karat. Jewelry does not have to be marked with its karat quality, but most of it is. If there is a karat quality mark, next to it must be the U.S. registered trademark of the person or company that will stand behind the mark, as required by the National Gold and Silver Stamping Act.
"Solid gold" can refer to any karat gold if the inside of the item of jewelry is not hollow. The proportion of gold in the piece of jewelry is still determined by the karat mark.
"Plated," "gold-filled," "gold overlay" and "rolled gold plate" are terms used to describe jewelry that has a layer of at least 10-karat gold mechanically bonded to a base metal. If such jewelry is marked with one of these terms, the term itself must follow the karat quality of the gold used (14K gold overlay, for example). If the layer of karat gold constitutes less than 1/20th of the total weight of the object, any marking must state the actual percentage of karat gold, such as "1/40th 14K gold overlay."
Platinum is a precious metal used in fine jewelry. It has a silvery appearance and usually is alloyed with a related metal called iridium.
Jewelry marked "silver" or "sterling silver" must contain 92.5 percent silver under jewelry industry guidelines. The mark "coin silver" is used for alloys containing 90 percent silver. Under the National Gold and Silver Stamping Act, quality-marked silver also must bear a U.S. registered trademark.
To qualify as "gemstones," minerals must possess beauty (affected by color, transparency and brilliance) which is brought out by cutting; durability (the stone's hardness and toughness); and rarity (taking into consideration size and quality). Some organic materials also are used in jewelry.
The most popular organic gem is the pearl. A pearl is the response of a mollusk to the presence of an irritating impurity accidentally introduced into its body. A cultured pearl is the result of the intentional insertion of a mother-of-pearl bead into a live mollusk. Whether introduced accidentally or intentionally, the pearl-making process is the same; the mollusk coats the irritant with a substance called nacre.
According to FTC guidelines, a synthetic or imitation stone cannot be offered for sale without disclosing that it is not natural. For example, a ruby made in a laboratory, having the same composition as a natural stone, must be described as "synthetic," "created," "laboratory-grown" or "man-made."
Next week we will continue by going into units of measurements involving gemstones and what to look for when purchasing a watch.

Abstract: Dwight Henry said state officials term the proposal a "wacky" solution. Henry supported moving the treatment plant off the Thomaston waterfront, but not at the expense of north-end residents. Many fear that spraying sewer waste on the land will pollute ground water, Henry said. Part of the area being considered for the disposal site is a farm owned by the Thorndike brothers. Paul Thorndike said Monday that the land is all clay and is too wet and unsuitable for waste disposal and supported the construction of a sewer pipe to the existing treatment plant in Rockland. Art Pease said the land proposed for a disposal site has had heavy erosion problems from heavy runoff into the Oyster River.

Full text: THOMASTON -- A proposed $7 million solution to the town sewer problems met strong opposition at a public hearing Monday night at Watts Hall. Board of Selectman Chairman Lee Ann Upham indicated a second public hearing will be called to answer questions raised by the public.
Many residents favored renovation of the current plant rather than moving the system to the north end of town near the Oyster River. About 100 residents attended the session.
Selectmen hoped to have the proposal before a town meeting in September.
Engineers told the crowd on Monday night that the current treatment plant is 27 years old and located on a restrictive site on the town waterfront on the St. George River. Renovating the existing plant was rejected as too expensive. Also rejected because of excessive costs were alternatives to extend pipelines to treatment plants in Rockland or Warren.
Selectmen and engineers have recommended a $7 million proposal with lagoon treatment and effluent either sprayed on land or discharged into the river, depending on the season. The proposal calls for using about 185 acres at the north end of town off Booker Street.
That area is clearly unsuitable for spraying effluent, said Dana Clukey. The land is marked with many deep ravines which run to the river. Any runoff would end up in the Oyster River, which empties into the St. George River, he said. "That land is so wet that you couldn't get a skidder in there in the spring," he said. Comments from engineers and consultant John Fancy that state law would not permit a spray program which caused any environmental damage brought laughter from the audience.
When selectman John Hathaway said the spraying will have minor odor problems but will not pollute land at the disposal site, one woman yelled out "Well, why don't you sell your land and move up there?"
Dwight Henry said state officials term the proposal a "wacky" solution. Henry supported moving the treatment plant off the Thomaston waterfront, but not at the expense of north-end residents. Many fear that spraying sewer waste on the land will pollute ground water, Henry said.
Diane Corbett said that leaving human waste in "open cesspools" could allow mosquitoes and flies to spread diseases like AIDS and cholera. She asked for concrete assurances from state officials that the health and safety of residents will not be compromised by the plan.
Part of the area being considered for the disposal site is a farm owned by the Thorndike brothers. Paul Thorndike said Monday that the land is all clay and is too wet and unsuitable for waste disposal and supported the construction of a sewer pipe to the existing treatment plant in Rockland. Art Pease said the land proposed for a disposal site has had heavy erosion problems from heavy runoff into the Oyster River.
Chairman Upham said the proposal was modeled after a highly successful program in Damariscotta. Officials from Damariscotta will be invited to any future discussions, she said. Selectman Peter Lammert said the same system has been used successfully in Greenville for decades.
Officials said the pipeline to Rockland would cost $8 million, plus other expenses including a $2 million "buy-in" cost. Selectman Upham reminded voters that they had agreed to abandon the current treatment plant site at the March town meeting.

Study: Overfishing has stressed world's oceans to the limit Worldwatch Inst percent drop in catch

Abstract: "Although worldwide environmental degradation of the oceans contributes to the decline of marine life, overfishing is the primary cause of dwindling fish populations," said the report by the nonprofit Worldwatch Institute. "The oceans are not the unlimited reservoir of low-cost food they were once considered." All fishing grounds in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as the Mediterranean and Black seas, are in decline after peaking between 1973 and 1991, the institute said. If countries are to end overfishing, the report said, they must choose whether to favor large-scale, industrial fishers; medium scale fishers; or small-scale, community-based fishers.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The world's oceans have been fished nearly to the limits, after decades of fishermen using bigger boats and more advanced hunting technologies, according to a report released Saturday.
"Although worldwide environmental degradation of the oceans contributes to the decline of marine life, overfishing is the primary cause of dwindling fish populations," said the report by the nonprofit Worldwatch Institute. "The oceans are not the unlimited reservoir of low-cost food they were once considered."
A 5 percent decline in the worldwide catch since 1989 is due largely to more people fishing in large-scale, industrial operations, often in waters that are becoming more polluted, the report said.
Meanwhile, world population is growing at 1.6 percent annually, equivalent to the population of Mexico being added to the world each year, the report said.
"This is a global problem that has already caused armed confrontations between fishing nations, gunfire between fishers and hunger in the developing world," said Peter Weber, author of the report, "Net Loss: Fish, Jobs and the Marine Environment."
"If current mismanagement continues, we can expect a future in which millions of fishers are out of work. ... A future in which traditional fishing cultures from Nova Scotia to Malaysia disappear," he said.
After decades of rapid growth, all the planet's major fishing grounds are at or beyond their limits, and many have already suffered serious declines, the report said.
All fishing grounds in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as the Mediterranean and Black seas, are in decline after peaking between 1973 and 1991, the institute said.
Only the Indian Ocean fisheries are still increasing total output, although they are unlikely to expand much more and could be poised for serious declines, the institute said.
The total catch has shrunk by more than 30 percent in four of the hardest-hit areas -- the Pacific's east-central region and the Atlantic's northwest, west-central and southeast sectors.
The supply of fishery products grew at three times the rate of human population growth during the 1950s and '60s. But the once abundant North Atlantic cod now may be commercially extinct, western Atlantic bluefin tuna are down to only 10 percent of their former abundance, several North Pacific salmon species are on the brink of extinction and oysters in the Chesapeake Bay are at only 4 percent of former levels, the report said.
Declining catches have already cost more than 100,000 jobs in the last few years among the world's 15 million to 21 million fishermen, the report said.
"It is not just the number of fishers that counts, but also the size of their nets, the number of their hooks, the girth of their boats -- in short, their capacity to fish," Weber said.
From 1970 to 1990, the world's fishing fleet doubled, from 585,000 to 1.2 million large boats, the report said.
"Government policies have for the most part promoted overexpansion of the fishing industry" and primarily benefited industrial fishing, the institute said.
If countries are to end overfishing, the report said, they must choose whether to favor large-scale, industrial fishers; medium scale fishers; or small-scale, community-based fishers.

Abstract: "Twenty positions will be funded statewide, eight in the Down East RC&D area. The Washington County Soil & Water Conservation District will have two water quality coordinators; The University of Maine at Machias and the Beals Island Regional shellfish Hatchery at Beals will have five positions; and there will be one cranberry coordinator position working out of the Down East RC&D office in Cherryfield," he explained. "We were very fortunate to receive eight positions in Washington County." Nathan Pennell, office manager for the Washington County S&WCD office at Machias, said one of the two water quality coordinators would perform water quality studies on the St. Croix River watershed at Calais. The other coordinator would study the Chandler River watershed in the Jonesboro region, and would implement a coastal water quality monitoring program from Roque Bluffs to Addison. The studies will include recommendations favoring water protection and pollution cleanup.

The total cost of the ACNS project beginning in September is expected to be about $500,000. In addition to a federal grant of more than $300,000, several participating government agencies will provide matching funds for the overall project. Each agency will be expected to contribute about $1,800 toward each position funded with a stipend of $12,000.
AmeriCorps is President Clinton's national service initiative that allows people to earn college or vocational school scholarships or credit to pay off existing educational loans while performing critical service to meet human, environmental, public safety and educational needs.
Any Maine citizen, age 17 or older, is eligible to apply for one of the positions. The program will require applicants to have at least two years of college course work. There is no maximum or minimum family income requirement. Applications will be accepted until Aug. 5.
Those hired under the service program will work one year, earning $12,000. Those with a minimum of 1,700 hours of service, also will receive an educational award worth $4,725.
Dana Nelson, coordinator for the bi-county Down East Resource and Development agency at Cherryfield, prepared the grant application on behalf of several participating organizations. He said Friday that the grant was approved by the AmeriCorp Foundation.
"Twenty positions will be funded statewide, eight in the Down East RC&D area. The Washington County Soil & Water Conservation District will have two water quality coordinators; The University of Maine at Machias and the Beals Island Regional shellfish Hatchery at Beals will have five positions; and there will be one cranberry coordinator position working out of the Down East RC&D office in Cherryfield," he explained. "We were very fortunate to receive eight positions in Washington County."
The cranberry industry in Washington and Hancock counties will benefit from the enhancement of an Integrated Crop Management Program for growers. Nelson said the cranberry coordinator would work out of Cherryfield.
Nathan Pennell, office manager for the Washington County S&WCD office at Machias, said one of the two water quality coordinators would perform water quality studies on the St. Croix River watershed at Calais. The other coordinator would study the Chandler River watershed in the Jonesboro region, and would implement a coastal water quality monitoring program from Roque Bluffs to Addison. The studies will include recommendations favoring water protection and pollution cleanup.
Five ACNS positions will be utilized by the shellfish hatchery at Beals. They will be involved in a variety of hatchery operations, including experimental research on clam beds.

Abstract: With the hope of avoiding another stampede of would-be shellfish diggers, officials in Brunswick are considering selling commercial clam licenses through a lottery system instead of through the town's old first-come, first-served system. Under the proposal, licenses would be sold based upon how many years diggers have held licenses here instead of which diggers reach the town hall first the morning of the sale day. This year, there were 90 licenses total. Fifty-three were sold to diggers who have held a license for three out of the last five years. About twice as many people as licenses wanted the remaining licenses.

Full text: BRUNSWICK -- With the hope of avoiding another stampede of would-be shellfish diggers, officials in Brunswick are considering selling commercial clam licenses through a lottery system instead of through the town's old first-come, first-served system.
The Marine Resources Committee decided to recommend that the town change its system starting next spring so that new licenses are sold through a set of four lottery drawings.
Under the proposal, licenses would be sold based upon how many years diggers have held licenses here instead of which diggers reach the town hall first the morning of the sale day.
This March, several clamdiggers received minor injuries when an informal line among them broke down and some diggers were pushed and shoved in their rush for the town hall doors.
One month later, Darrell E. Pennell and Ray Trombley, two diggers who didn't receive licenses, filed a lawsuit against the town which is still awaiting a trial date in Cumberland County Superior Court.
Every year, Brunswick officials do a detailed survey intended to estimate the amount of harvestable bushels of clams in all of the town's shellfish beds. Those survey results then determine the number of licenses available for sale.
But, especially in recent years, the demand for licenses has been greater than the number of licenses available.
This year, there were 90 licenses total. Fifty-three were sold to diggers who have held a license for three out of the last five years. About twice as many people as licenses wanted the remaining licenses.
Following the stampede, in which several older men with families had been pushed out for licenses, there were suggestions of doing away with the survey information and selling more licenses.
But the committee opted for a new system instead.
"It is a good answer," said James A. MacLeod, chairman of the Marine Resources Committee. "We tried to be as fair as possible to everybody."

Abstract: The Department of Marine Resources closed all clam beds Tuesday from Trescott to the Canadian border including Cobscook Bay, citing high levels of the plankton that causes red tide. An estimated 300 diggers will be affected by the move. He said the presence of red tide toxin in clams from the Cobscook Bay area exceeded federal limits, while clams from other flats in the closed area did not. To be sure none of the contaminated clams were harvested or sold for human consumption, DMR closed the entire area to harvesting. Although the red plankton is harmless to clams, it produces a toxin that accumulates in marine animals. Filter feeders, such as clams and mussels, thrive on plankton.

Full text: The Department of Marine Resources closed all clam beds Tuesday from Trescott to the Canadian border including Cobscook Bay, citing high levels of the plankton that causes red tide. An estimated 300 diggers will be affected by the move.
John Hurst, a biologist with the Department of Marine Resources laboratory at West Boothbay, said, "My two great concerns are for public safety and the well-being of fishermen. The public's safety comes first, although I am always aware of the needs of fishermen to earn a livelihood for their families."
He predicted a lengthy closure, based on a recent report of "high rises" of blooming plankton in the Bay of Fundy.
He said the presence of red tide toxin in clams from the Cobscook Bay area exceeded federal limits, while clams from other flats in the closed area did not. To be sure none of the contaminated clams were harvested or sold for human consumption, DMR closed the entire area to harvesting.
Although the red plankton is harmless to clams, it produces a toxin that accumulates in marine animals. Filter feeders, such as clams and mussels, thrive on plankton.
Humans who eat the contaminated shellfish can become ill from paralytic shellfish poisoning. Plankton is believed to originate in coastal rivers.
Robert D. Lewis of the DMR office in Augusta, said Hurst would continue weekly testing of the closed area. The red tide hot line for people with questions is 1-800-232-4733.
About 300 seasonal clam diggers were put out of work in the Cobscook Bay region, according to Sheldon Ashby of Pembroke Clam Co. in Pembroke.
"I have about 75 diggers who supplied me with clams," he said. That number includes about 25 who sold their clams to Lawrence Lyons, Ashby's buyer in Lubec, where flats also are closed.
Ashby said his best "money months" are June, July and August. To keep his customers supplied with clams, he is buying from western Maine dealers. "I can't get enough clams that way and it costs me about $10 a bushel, but I'll manage to stay in business and satisfy my customers," he said.
While Ashby's business is suffering, the diggers who were paid about $75 a bushel may be hurting the most. After taking home about $150 for about three hours of work each day, they are now out of the clam business. Also, if they wait to work in the blueberry harvest in eastern Washington County they may not find work until fields ripen about the second week of August.

Abstract: The 85-year-old Maine author -- who has 28 notches in his literary belt -- writes with the fey sophistication of a wise troll. One can imagine the glint of amusement in his lively, bespectacled eyes as he penned these words in the foreword to "Dispatches from Maine": "We don't write books in Maine. We live books. We go hunting and fishing, we tend out on Grange meetings, we socialize as time permits, and after we've done enough living in Maine the pile is big enough and we send it to a publisher." As variable as Maine weather, "Dispatches from Maine" brings under discussion such subjects as what ever happened to marbles, the proper ritual for serving thick Barbados molasses and cream with oatmeal, how to cut the ice and fill it in the big icehouse behind the dingle, corn snow at sapping time, the day the author's father found a carpet tack in the cookie he was eating, laying the cornerstone at [John Gould] farm, and the greatest thing since sliced bread (Barbados molasses) ... these and myriad others equally wise, reflective, or just plain droll are flocked together like a parliament of owls.

Full text: DISPATCHES FROM MAINE, by John Gould, Norton, 199 pages, $23.
"Some love the meat, some love to pick the bones, " observed John Bunyan about reader reaction to his celebrated masterpiece, "Pilgrim's Progress." This challenge is built into John Gould's collection of essays winnowed from the aggregate of columns he wrote as a weekly feature for The Christian Science Monitor from 1942 to 1992.
The 85-year-old Maine author -- who has 28 notches in his literary belt -- writes with the fey sophistication of a wise troll. One can imagine the glint of amusement in his lively, bespectacled eyes as he penned these words in the foreword to "Dispatches from Maine": "We don't write books in Maine. We live books. We go hunting and fishing, we tend out on Grange meetings, we socialize as time permits, and after we've done enough living in Maine the pile is big enough and we send it to a publisher."
The lead piece in his omnium-gatherum, called "Buck-Saws and Christmas Trees," is the tuning fork for the 74 other essays in that it sets the tone for the laconic independence with which Maine natives are so closely associated. In it Gould explains how it happened that he converted "a grand piece of black walnut" into a bucksaw. He also sets down some of the aberrant impulses indulged in by his neighbors -- Chris Wadell, for example, who painted his hilltop silo with red, white, and blue stripes ("Not a man in the neighborhood commented on this improvement, and it is likely Chris never expected them to."), and Charlie Little's decision to set up a shapely fir tree on his front piazza one August and trim it with lights and strings of popcorn.
"Are we peculiar in our private belief that a man's own inclination is to be indulged?" asked Gould. "Hasn't conformity to rules of behavior taken a lot of snap out of life?"
Essayists are a breed apart. Like leaders in the game of snap the whip they startle and surprise readers with their sudden mental twists and turns. Gould does this in "Fame is Spelled in Lower Case" in which he puts a novel spin on the plight of inventors whose identity is often eclipsed by the success of their inventions. "When man makes the better mousetrap," writes the author, "his name will no doubt go on and on and on. But it probably will be spelled with a small letter ..." Who is Mr. Pitman, he demands. When and where did he live? He then reveals that Mr. Pitman is the inventor of the indispensable device that millions of farmers depend on to keep their mowers in operation, the pitman rod. Another condemned to lower-case anonymity is Mr. Peavey. Yet the peavey, a cant hook used by log rollers from Bangor to the four corners of the world, is de rigueur in logging circles.
Then there was the day Gould read a magazine piece about an Indian named Quadequina. In 1630 Quadequina gave the Pilgrims a bushel of popped corn for Thanksgiving. Given the fact that no suitable utensils existed back then, how had he popped the corn, wondered the author. A hot, flat rock, perhaps? This conjured up the risible vision of flying popcorn landing in the junipers, sweetfern, hardtack, alders, hackmatack and blueberry bushes, with Quandequina in hot pursuit.
As variable as Maine weather, "Dispatches from Maine" brings under discussion such subjects as what ever happened to marbles, the proper ritual for serving thick Barbados molasses and cream with oatmeal, how to cut the ice and fill it in the big icehouse behind the dingle, corn snow at sapping time, the day the author's father found a carpet tack in the cookie he was eating, laying the cornerstone at Gould farm, and the greatest thing since sliced bread (Barbados molasses) ... these and myriad others equally wise, reflective, or just plain droll are flocked together like a parliament of owls.
The author and his wife, Dorothy, live in Friendship. It was in the russet month of October 1942 that Gould appeared in print as "a country correspondent whose writings naturally have a distinct flavor of the soil." Readers chuckled over his dry wit, appreciated his sly sallies, and were captivated by his essays on Maine's lares and penates. Most of all they responded to his wisdom. And that is the peerless pearl in the oyster of "Dispatches from Maine."
Bea Goodrich's reviews are a monthly feature in the Books & Music section.

Island clam flats studied

Abstract: The red-line is a term that describes the flats around Casco Bay that have been closed for much of the last 40 years. Today, 49 percent of the bay's clam flats are off-limits to clammers, representing a loss of nearly 200 jobs in an area from Phippsburg to Cape Elizabeth. "These are vital clam flats around densely populated areas. When a flat closes, the clam diggers' lives are ruined," [Joseph Payne] said.

Full text: FALMOUTH (AP) -- Casco Bay's baykeeper says a plan to reopen a once thriving clam flat off Mackworth Island that was closed because of pollution is "a `win-win-win' situation."
"Polluted shellfish habitat can be rehabbed, jobs can be restored, and citizens can help get rid of the `red-line' by serving as stewards of the bay. We'll come up with a plan that everyone can be happy with," said Joseph Payne.
The red-line is a term that describes the flats around Casco Bay that have been closed for much of the last 40 years. Today, 49 percent of the bay's clam flats are off-limits to clammers, representing a loss of nearly 200 jobs in an area from Phippsburg to Cape Elizabeth.
"These are vital clam flats around densely populated areas. When a flat closes, the clam diggers' lives are ruined," Payne said.
The Mackworth Island project, sponsored by the conservation group Friends of Casco Bay, seeks to demonstrate that the cost of solving pollution problems can be offset by the resulting economic benefits.
The group plans to begin the project by assessing the clam population at the flat, which has been closed for the past decade.
If the flat proves to have a strong clam base, the group will develop a detailed plan on what will need to be done by the town, nearby residents and state officials to reopen it.
Cleanup programs over the past three decades have brought the bay's major sewage problems under control. The focus now has turned to smaller problems such as roadside waste runoff that are more difficult to pinpoint.
"When there is a heavy rainfall, waste from parking lots and animals grazing in nearby fields gets carried into the nearest stream," said Brad Sterl, a marine biologist with the Department of Marine Resources.

Dexter seeks grant for Echo Lake work

Author: Tammy Lockhart Of the NEWS Staff

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]29 June 1994.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/413817729?accountid=10457

Abstract: According to Dave Pearson of the town's code enforcement office, chances are good that Dexter will qualify for a loan. A letter is being sent to property owners in the Echo Lake area to find out if they are interested in participating in the program.

Full text: DEXTER -- Town officials are seeking state funds to assist property owners in the Echo Lake watershed to upgrade or replace their property's septic systems.
According to Dave Pearson of the town's code enforcement office, chances are good that Dexter will qualify for a loan. A letter is being sent to property owners in the Echo Lake area to find out if they are interested in participating in the program. Once the scope of the project is known, he said, a formal grant request will be sent.
The funding would be provided through the Maine Department of Environmental Protection's Small Community Grant Program. This program can provide up to 90 percent grant funding of sewage treatment and disposal systems to eliminate waste-water discharges which affect drinking water supplies, pollute shellfishing areas, degrade water quality, or cause a public nuisance.
The program is intended to provide facilities in rural areas of the state not served by public sewers. The maximum project cost which can be funded by the program is $100,000.
Most facilities funded by the Small Community Program are for individual on-site septic systems. These can be either owned or operated by the municipality, or be privately owned.
Pearson said that if the town is successful in obtaining the grant money, the funds may be used to provide 90 percent of the cost of replacing systems for year-round residences; 50 percent of the costs for businesses; and 25 percent for seasonal buildings.
Inspections of the systems in the Echo Lake watershed will be conducted this summer by John Boucher, who is employed by the office through the Senior Citizen Employment Project, Pearson said.
If the survey can be completed by this fall and the application completed, Pearson said, the funding for the project may be available to the town in May 1995.

Full text: YORK (AP) -- A red tide that hit the coast two weeks ago has made it dangerous to eat clams, mussels, oysters and quahogs harvested from the affected areas, authorities said.
The area of concern stretches from the Piscataqua River north to Biddeford Pool, where clam flats have been closed. Lesser restrictions are in place as far north as Cape Elizabeth.
People who eat clams in restaurants or purchase them in local markets needn't worry because state law requires diggers to show where the clams are harvested, said Sgt. David Moulton of the Maine Marine Patrol.

Full text: CHARLOTTETOWN, Prince Edward Island -- They have argued about it for at least a century -- whether there should be a bridge or tunnel between this verdant crescent-shaped island province and mainland Canada.
Some said a "fixed link" was needed to spur economic growth and create jobs; others said it would damage a delicate ecology and destroy the idyllic "island way of life."
Now a nine-mile-long bridge is being built, to connect Borden, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick, across the narrowest part of the Strait of Northumberland.
"It'll open up the island," said Tracy Rogers, a Charlottetown native studying to be a secretary. "It'll increase employment and make it easier to come and go. People are just getting fed up with long delays at the ferry."
Hundreds of carpenters, electricians, ironworkers and engineers have invaded the island, Canada's smallest province, home to 130,000 people. Approach piers are already rising a few hundred yards beyond the ferry terminals.
Crews with tractors and bulldozers are preparing staging areas in ocher cliffs above the sea to make precast concrete bridge sections, which will be hoisted into place by giant floating cranes.
The $620 million project, to be completed in three years, is providing jobs in the country's most depressed region.
"I think most people are glad something is finally happening," said Ron Ryder, who edits a monthly supplement on the bridge's construction for a Charlottetown daily, The Guardian.
"It's been a long and emotional argument, but basically most people are for it." Fifty-nine percent of islanders who voted in a 1988 plebiscite favored a link. More recent polls also show a majority in favor.
But not everyone is for it, and to many opponents, the story is far from over. This project has been analyzed more extensively than any other in Canada's history.
Many doubters believe, despite reassurances from the builders, that ice and the unusually strong currents in the strait will play havoc with the bridge's vertical supports.
"Just wait till winter," said Bea Mair, president of Friends of the Island, the main group of environmentalists, traditionalists, fishermen and ferry workers who have fought the project and have yet to disband. "Ice will come and sweep the bridge away."
Another issue is whether the support structures will hold ice in the strait longer than normal. A delayed departure of ice each spring could cool water temperatures, affecting marine animals' reproductive cycles, and could cause large chunks of ice to damage parts of the seabed that are habitat for herring, oysters, hard-shell clams, lobsters and scallops.
"The long-term impact could be felt throughout the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence in terms of reduced productivity and depressed fisheries," said Dr. Irene Novaczek, a marine biologist and chairwoman of the Canadian Oceans Caucus, a network of environmental groups. Much of the flora and fauna of the strait, she said, are not found elsewhere north of Cape Cod.
In spite of a $7.2 million federal compensation package, fishermen have little good to say about the bridge.
Francis "Buck" Watts, who catches herring and lobster in his 43-foot fiberglass boat, Evening Dew, is president of the island's 800-member Fishermen's Association. "Neither myself nor the association is against progress," he said. "But we are against the demise of an industry."
The bridge is directly over scallop and lobster beds and spawning areas for herring. While fishing continues elsewhere in the strait, fishermen fear permanent losses as a result of the construction activity.
Beyond economic and ecological concerns is the perception that a special way of life is about to end.
Many residents think the island, with its quiet roads, cow-dotted hills, long white beaches and low crime rate, is among the most livable places in Canada.
The rich landscape has been made familiar to millions by "Anne of Green Gables," the 1908 tale of an orphan from Nova Scotia raised in a snug Prince Edward Island farmhouse.
It remains largely as Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author, described it, "Below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew."
Prince Edward Island attracts 700,000 tourists a year, many drawn to the site of the Green Gables house in Cavendish, northwest of Charlottetown.
Although economic surveys indicate the bridge will increase tourism by 25 percent, many prefer their separateness.
Warren Delaney lives in a farmhouse on the main road between the Borden ferry slip and Charlottetown. Mowing his back lawn one recent afternoon, he said the bridge "means we'll get all that trash from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia."
Charlotte Preston is a clerk in a Charlottetown gift shop. Born here, she lived "away" for 17 years and returned because of the low crime rate. "I like being an island, not an isthmus," she said. "You don't rob a bank when there are limited ways to leave."
The debate has seeped into the folklore of the island. Here is part of one recent song, titled "Fixed Link," written and recorded by George Brothers, a musician who also works in a national park near Cavendish:
On the one hand, there's a way of life.
Some feel it will be lost.
The other side wants progress.
No matter what the cost.

Full text: SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A live lobster special put supermarket officials in hot water with some Northern California customers who worried the shellfish were suffering on their way to the cooking pot.
"Just because we find it difficult to empathize with them or we don't understand what they're feeling doesn't mean that they don't feel stress or pain," said Diane Allevato, executive director of the Marin County Humane Society.
Oakland-based Safeway Stores assured customers they would do everything possible to make the lobsters' last hours tolerable.
The controversy boiled over last week at stores in Marin County, an area just north of San Francisco known for its million-dollar mansions, breathtaking coastline and holistic-minded populace.
Allevato said after hundreds of lobsters were shipped into stores for a Father's Day special, her office started getting calls from people complaining that the lobsters were being jammed into tanks or kept in boxes and plastic bags.
"They were essentially suffocating," she said. Even though the lobsters were headed for a fairly gruesome death anyway, callers felt they were entitled to some consideration, she said.
Safeway spokeswoman Debra Lambert said the lobsters were kept out of water when stores ran out of room. Lobsters can breathe out of water, so it is not cruel to keep them in open plastic bags or boxes provided they are not crowded, are surrounded by moist towels and kept cool, she said.

Timing is everything when it comes to nailing trophy fish

Abstract: As he released the No. 2 rod and started winching up the downriggers, [Scott Clark] told his oldest offspring to shift the motor into neutral. But because the wind was astern, [Ben Clark] was still losing line. Directly, he yelled, "Dad, I'm out of line!" A swift glance at his son's reel caused the senior Clark to command: "Reverse and full power!" All that was left on Ben's reel spool was the knot holding the 10-pound test line. Luckily - and because of [Jason]'s swift action at the helm - Ben began regaining line. Then, allowing that Ben had hooked onto the state of Maine, his father took the rod to see if he could release the rock or whatever had snagged the bait. But when he tugged, something weighty tugged back - twice. Quickly, Scott handed the rod back to his son with instructions to brace his feet. He then ordered Jason to shift the motor back into neutral. Eighteen shooters endured rain and mosquitoes as they tested their skills. The overall match winner and first expert was Dave Dow of Old Town, who shot a score of 476 out of 500, including 13 bullseyes out of 50. John Lynds of Scarborough shot his way into second place with a score of 467 and 11 bullseyes. Rocky Prout of Cape Elizabeth posted a score of 467 and seven bullseyes to win third place and second expert; and Ray Gastonguay of Westbrook won fourth place and third expert with a score of 455 and six bullseyes.

Full text: Along about mid-June, the brothers Jason and Ben Clark of Kenduskeag, ages 13 and 11, respectively, convinced their father, Scott Clark, that it was time to go fishing. After gathering their trolling gear and lunches, Clark and sons, along with Tim Ward of East Corinth, towed their boat to Green Lake.
It's no secret that fishing success depends largely on being in the right place at the right time, and on that particular day the location and timing were perfect. In fact, it took only about 45 minutes of trolling sewn-on smelts before the No. 1 rod popped in its downrigger. Ben mittened onto the bowed rod and began reeling, but to no avail - begrudgingly, the reel's drag gave line.
As he released the No. 2 rod and started winching up the downriggers, Scott told his oldest offspring to shift the motor into neutral. But because the wind was astern, Ben was still losing line. Directly, he yelled, "Dad, I'm out of line!" A swift glance at his son's reel caused the senior Clark to command: "Reverse and full power!" All that was left on Ben's reel spool was the knot holding the 10-pound test line.
Luckily - and because of Jason's swift action at the helm - Ben began regaining line. Then, allowing that Ben had hooked onto the state of Maine, his father took the rod to see if he could release the rock or whatever had snagged the bait. But when he tugged, something weighty tugged back - twice. Quickly, Scott handed the rod back to his son with instructions to brace his feet. He then ordered Jason to shift the motor back into neutral.
During the tug of war that followed, Ben derricked the togue to within a few feet of the surface eight or 10 times, only to have it bore back to bottom again. When the fish eventually was brought to the surface, it rolled onto its broad side and showed that only one hook of the treble hook was hanging in its jaw. Cap'n Clark immediately gave Jason the order to "shut 'er down."
As it sculled dangerously close to the motor's shaft and prop, Scott attempted to net the trophy togue but the transducer bracket was in the way. A lunging, last-ditch effort with the net was successful, however, and amid loud cheers and congratulations, the finned prize was brought aboard - minus the hook and with no hook on Ben's line. Talk about fisherman's luck. Later, while loading the boat onto the trailer, Tim Ward discovered the hook fouled in the boat's tranducer bracket.
According to the weights-and-measures apparatus, the togue was 28 1/2 inches long and weighed 10 pounds, 8 ounces. That, my friend, was a bragging-size fish and, being a fisherman, young Ben Clark knew well the stigma of "fish stories." Therefore, he immediately asked his father for a loan toward having the togue mounted. Considering the "interest" involved, I'd call that a sound investment.
On June 12, the Maine Highpower Rifle Shooters held a National Match Course high-power rifle competition at the Oyster River Range in Warren. The match sanctioned by the National Rifle Association included competitions at ranges of 200, 300, and 600 yards while firing from standing, sitting, and prone positions.
Eighteen shooters endured rain and mosquitoes as they tested their skills. The overall match winner and first expert was Dave Dow of Old Town, who shot a score of 476 out of 500, including 13 bullseyes out of 50. John Lynds of Scarborough shot his way into second place with a score of 467 and 11 bullseyes. Rocky Prout of Cape Elizabeth posted a score of 467 and seven bullseyes to win third place and second expert; and Ray Gastonguay of Westbrook won fourth place and third expert with a score of 455 and six bullseyes.
When the smoke cleared, Gus Norcross of Winthrop was named first sharpshooter with a score of 465 and 10 bullseyes; and Les Higgins of South Portland took first marksman honors with a score of 379 and six bullseyes.
Come July 9, the Highpower Rifle Shooters will hold a practice-training session at the Oyster River Range. The fee for the session, which is open to the public, is $15. Ammunition for .308 cal. rifles will be provided. The club's next scheduled match is a 200-yard offhand competition that will be held at the Capital City Rifle and Pistol Club in Augusta on July 19. For further information contact: Gus Norcross, 395-4515; Rocky Prout, 799-6071; Ray Gastonguay, 854-1458.
Many local sportsmen were shocked and saddened by the untimely death of Al Roberts of Brewer. Al was an avid and responsible outdoorsman who valued Maine's sporting traditions, particularly hunting, and who was a strong supporter of the constitutional right to own firearms. Needless to say, he'll be missed. I offer my condolences to his family and many friends.

Abstract: L'ETANG-DU-NORD, Quebec (AP) -- Henri Deraspe steers his boat into the choppy waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence as the pungent mix of sea breeze, fish bait and diesel fuel fills the air. His son Sylvain, 28, cuts up lobster bait at the back of the Steve D-8, named after Henri's eighth son. The two work hand-in-glove, pulling up lobster traps, rebaiting them and tossing the traps back to the depths off the Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec's archipelago in the middle of the gulf.

Full text: L'ETANG-DU-NORD, Quebec (AP) -- Henri Deraspe steers his boat into the choppy waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence as the pungent mix of sea breeze, fish bait and diesel fuel fills the air.
His son Sylvain, 28, cuts up lobster bait at the back of the Steve D-8, named after Henri's eighth son.
The two work hand-in-glove, pulling up lobster traps, rebaiting them and tossing the traps back to the depths off the Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec's archipelago in the middle of the gulf.
The nine-week lobster season is the backbone of the local fishing economy. It provided 1,000 jobs last year and brought in more than $18 million.
It's also a deeply rooted way of life, and there's widespread concern that lobsters may go the way of codfish and other disappearing stocks.
"If the lobster goes a lot of people will leave these islands," said Sylvain. "What would be left?"
There was a 6 percent drop in the number of lobsters caught last year, compared with 1992's record catch. A further 5 percent decline is predicted for this year.
Fisheries experts are confident these are normal fluctuations in the stocks.
"We don't see this as a decrease in the resource, but as a returning to normal levels," says Pierre Couillard, a shellfish expert in the gulf for the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
"We're not panicking yet."
But some fisherman are, especially young ones like Sylvain. They fear that the combination of overfishing and pollution may lead to the death of the entire fishery in the southern gulf.
Sylvain blames greedy fisherman.
"Because we're young, they (older fisherman) don't want to listen to us," he said. "They just want to put as much money in their pockets so they can go to Florida."
His 55-year-old father, who has been fishing for almost 30 years, shares Sylvain's concern about the industry. "There used to be a good life in it, but I'm worried for him and his children."
There's a hot debate in the archipelago on the use of large lobster traps that measure up to 4 feet long -- a controversy also seen in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia in recent years.
Fishermen who use traps about half that length maintain the large ones are depleting the stocks.
"I have no doubt at all that it (the use of big traps) has to be stopped," says Urbain Miousse, 63, who has fished for 47 years off L'Etang-du-Nord, a fishing port on the island of Cap-aux-Meules.
"If we're not careful we're going to pay for it as we're doing with the cod."
But those using the large traps say the practice merely allows the available lobsters to be caught more quickly. They suggest their opponents are jealous of their larger catches.
Regardless, Fisheries and Oceans plans to change the rules for next year so that fisherman can use only 210 large traps or 300 small ones, instead of 300 of either.
Meanwhile, some fishermen are keeping undersized lobster. That could affect the stock's ability to regenerate.
"In this business you don't fish for today, you do it for tomorrow," said Alvin Dickson, another fisherman.
He noted that technological advances such as depth-finding equipment are making it harder for lobsters to avoid capture.
Fishermen are also worried about the Irving Whale barge, which sank in 1970 just west of the islands and may be raised next year.
They fear the vessel, now 190 feet below the surface, could crack open.

Midcoast road runs from fresh water to salt water

Author: Brian Swartz Advertising Staff Editor

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]16 June 1994.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/413725786?accountid=10457

Abstract: The road starts in Swanville, a town in northern Waldo County. West of "downtown" Swanville, Route 141 spins off Route 131 where a traffic triangle stands near a large white farmhouse. It's here where a motorist traveling north on 131 with bad brakes could slip through the intersection and land in Swan Lake. The bridge isn't a problem to navigate. Below Searsmont, Route 131 follows a basically straight course through Appleton to an intersection with Route 17 in Union. Route 17 connects Rockland with Augusta; by now, once you've crossed the Searsmont-Appleton town line, you are entering Knox County. At 43.9 miles, Route 131 intersects with Route 1 in Thomaston. It's very confusing at this spot, because 131 does split right or left around a traffic island off the edge of Route 1. If you split right, you're pointed west toward Waldoboro; if you split left, you're pointed east toward Thomaston.

Full text: You literally run out of road in Port Clyde.
There are places in Maine, like Oquossoc over in Franklin County, where a numbered road runs into the water. Depending upon your point of view, Route 4 either starts or stops at Haines Landing in Oquossoc Village. If it does stop there, and you don't apply your brakes in time, you could wind up floating in Mooselookmeguntic Lake.
The same problem occurs with Route 131, a rural highway that runs through Waldo and Knox counties. This road reaches water at both ends, however, and on a rainy day, no one should drive 131 with poor brakes.
The road starts in Swanville, a town in northern Waldo County. West of "downtown" Swanville, Route 141 spins off Route 131 where a traffic triangle stands near a large white farmhouse. It's here where a motorist traveling north on 131 with bad brakes could slip through the intersection and land in Swan Lake.
From its northern terminus, 131 dashes west past the Swanville Elementary School on the left and the Swanville Community Church on the right. Just beyond the church lies the Greenlawn Cemetery. Route 131 soon vaults across the Frankfort Road before hanging a left at Nickerson Mills.
Only 5 1/2 miles from Swanville, the highway crosses the tracks beside Waldo Station. Beyond the tracks, 131 passes a few houses and scattered barns. At the 6 1/2-mile point, there's a big gravel pit (called "The Pit") on the left.
At 7.3 miles, Route 131 crosses Route 7. At 8 1/2 miles, you will pass the Waldo Little League field on the right. In late summer, and despite the light rain, corn stands tall in a field beyond the diamond.
As 131 continues across the backside of rural Waldo County, it reaches the blinking red light located at the intersection with Route 137. Here, 9.6 miles from Swanville, you've got to stop and look both ways.
Past Route 137, 131 heads downhill into thick woods. Dutton's Greenhouse Nursery lies along both sides of the road at 11.4 miles from Swanville.
At 12.2 miles, Route 131 runs through downtown Morrill. There's the post office on the left; just beyond stand the Morrill Fire Station, an Irving gas station, and Honesty Grange No. 83. The last-named structure, a big white building with a steel-girder fire escape, stands on the right, a short distance from a cemetery and the Morrill Baptist Church, which are located on opposite sides of the road.
Then it's back into the woods.
The only excitement for the next few miles is watching the cracks in the pavement. There is little sign of human habitation until Mile 15.5, when 131 passes the white highway marker for Belmont.
Now you're apparently nearing civilization again. There are some modern homes, then a sudden stop at the Route 3 intersection and a quick peek at the Belmont Fire Station. Route 131 slides right for a short distance on Route 3, then dips left at Mile 16.2.
The road's headed for Searsmont, whose line marker stands at Mile 17.6. The drizzle intensifies on this gloomy afternoon.
Route 131 intersects with Route 173 at the 19.5-mile mark, above downtown Searsmont. At 20.1 miles, 131 crosses the St. George River by Sprowl Brothers Inc. Then it's past the Searsmont United Methodist Church and the Fraternity Village General Store and a sign that warns, "Narrow bridge."
The bridge isn't a problem to navigate. Below Searsmont, Route 131 follows a basically straight course through Appleton to an intersection with Route 17 in Union. Route 17 connects Rockland with Augusta; by now, once you've crossed the Searsmont-Appleton town line, you are entering Knox County.
Route 131 follows Route 17 a short distance eastward before spinning off across from the Barrett Hill Road and moving into South Union. The road goes into Warren where the town line bisects the high ground between Seven Tree and Crawford ponds, neither really visible from the highway.
At 40.0 miles, Route 131 hangs a 90-left left just above downtown Warren. You'll notice the Frank D. Rowe School on the left, but pay attention: There's a "stop-stop-stop" indicator just beyond the school at the intersection with Route 90.
Across 90, at Mile 40.1, Route 131 passes the Crowe Rope Co. on the left. The Oyster River Trap Co. stands on the right at 41.2 miles. There are a few other businesses along the portion of Route 131 that cuts across Warren; perhaps the most unusual is a Saab dealership located some distance from any population centers.
At 43.9 miles, Route 131 intersects with Route 1 in Thomaston. It's very confusing at this spot, because 131 does split right or left around a traffic island off the edge of Route 1. If you split right, you're pointed west toward Waldoboro; if you split left, you're pointed east toward Thomaston.
Split left.
The speed limit along Route 1 drops to 30 miles per hour at Mile 44.2 from Swanville. You should slow down, because you're passing the State Police Barracks (Troop D) and the Thomaston State Penitentiary on the right.
Don't stop for hitchhikers here.
Downtown Thomaston encompasses about one square block of businesses like the Corner Gift Shop, Thomaston Miniature Works, People's Heritage Bank, the Hairloft, McDonald's Drug Store, Thomaston Book & Prints, and the Thomaston Cafe and Bakery. Even today, with the torrential downpour splattering on the pavement, people are moving on the sidewalks.
At Mile 45.3, Routes 1 and 131 pass the Thomaston Public Library on the right. Just 0.4 miles farther east, 131 turns right at Montpelier and starts the run toard Port Clyde.
At Mile 47.1, the Riverside Variety stands on the right side of Route 131 on the northern edge of South Thomaston. Below the store, open fields lead downhill to the St. George River, by now tidal.
At Mile 49.0, you will pass Monika's Bed & Breakfast on the right. Not far past this establishment are metal tepees and Indian figurines, crafted by an as-yet unidentified sculptor.
Route 131 crosses into St. George at Mile 49.4. At the 50-mile mark stands the metal artwork produced by the Open Air Gallery, which obviously provided the Indian settlement located upriver. Pay particular attention to the metal figures of St. George fighting his dragon.
You will start rolling through downtown St. George at Mile 51.0. A tenth of a mile beyond lies the turnoff to Route 73 on the left. This is a back way into Rockland.
At 55.1 miles, you're nearing the water. There's a lobster pound on the left here, and on a day like today, with the rain-laden, on-shore wind, you can smell the ocean.
Also at 55.1 miles, there stands a sign bidding you a "Welcome to Tenants Harbor." St. George is several villages (St. George, Tenants Harbor, Martinsville, and Port Clyde) rolled into one convenient government.
You will pass a Gulf sign on the left. At 55.8 miles, the road takes a sharp, 90-degree lefthand turn just above the Golden Hand Gift Shop (on the left) and the Churchill Bed & Breakfast. A big cemetery rims 131 on the left, too.
At Mile 57.6, a sign says, "Welcome Martinsville: Come Again." Route 131 crosses an S-bend inlet (from right to left into Mosquito Harbor) at 58.2 miles from Swanville. A peculiar stone building stands back from the road at Mile 58.9. At Mile 59.1 is the turnoff to Drift-In Beach, a spot that locals would just as soon not advertise.
You crest a hill at Mile 59.8; below you lies the sea. You've reached Port Clyde, literally the end of the trail, with the Black Harpoon on the left and Genesis and Doolittle Country Gifts on the right. Beyond lie Port Clyde Pottery and the post office with its three parking spaces.
When you crest the hill by Gallery By The Sea, you will enjoy a lovely view of the working harbor. Now, you can either turn right and drive past the Port Clyde General Store, or you can plunge straight ahead and into Port Clyde Harbor.
Either way, Route 131 ends beside Monhegan Boats at Mile 60.2.

Abstract: [Rose Binder] recently noted that, along the way, the pupils developed an interest in local shellfish stocks and initiated a population study of clams in South Lubec. "They have contacted municipal officials to try to develop a management plan for the flats," Binder said, adding that programs undertaken by the pupils as part of the study "have become an integral part of the math and science curriculum in the Middle School."

Full text: LUBEC -- A water quality study of Johnson's Bay and Lubec Narrows begun last year by Lubec Middle School pupils has been selected by Anheuser-Busch as a finalist for its annual "Pledge and a Promise" environmental award.
The project grew from a proposal submitted by Lubec Middle School teachers Marty Mahar and Rose Binder. The study, which combined math and science classes in scientific studies of local water quality, involved all sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders at the school.
In conducting the study, pupils gathered data through various tests, and developed theories about the effects of human habitation on coastal ecology in the Lubec area. The project included controlled experiments conducted by the pupils to either prove or disprove their theories.
Binder recently noted that, along the way, the pupils developed an interest in local shellfish stocks and initiated a population study of clams in South Lubec. "They have contacted municipal officials to try to develop a management plan for the flats," Binder said, adding that programs undertaken by the pupils as part of the study "have become an integral part of the math and science curriculum in the Middle School."
Funding included a $12,000 grant from the GTE Foundation's Growth Initiatives for Teachers Program. With only 330 students, the Lubec school was the smallest of about 60 schools nationwide to receive a GTE award last year. About 90 pupils were involved in the study.

Full text: MACHIAS -- Deputy Sheriff John W. Farnsworth, recently chosen 1993 Deputy Sheriff of the Year by the Washington County Sheriff's Department, knows what he likes about his job.
"I get great satisfaction in helping people," he said. As a law-enforcement officer, Farnsworth said his basic approach includes having a positive attitude and respect toward people in general.
A 49-year-old native of Addison, Farnsworth was given the department's highest award by Sheriff John B. Crowley at the annual awards ceremony on Thursday, May 26, at Helen's Restaurant in Machias.
Crowley said Farnsworth responded to more than 300 complaints. The amount exceeded the number of responses made by any deputy last year.
The award recipient has worked as a part-time deputy since September 1987, when he was appointed by the then-Sheriff Harold Prescott. His career in law enforcement started more than 10 years ago, when he was chosen constable for the Addison area.
Farnsworth also has worked as a shellfish-conservation warden for Addison; a shellfish warden for Milbridge; and he was employed by Hall's Security Services at the U.S. Air Force Radar Communications Center at Columbia Falls.
As one of about 60 deputies, his primary assignment includes investigations of burglaries, thefts and domestic complaints.
Other awards were presented by Crowley. They included: 1993 Rookie of the Year, to Michael Crabtree, a contract deputy for Lubec; Corrections Officer of the Year for the Washington County Jail, Sgt. Judy Worcester; Dispatcher of the Year for the Washington County Regional Communications Center, John Hennessey.
Reserve Deputy Sheriff Sherrill Colford Jr. received the Leigon of Honor for Injury in the Line of Duty.
Commendations for job performance and dedication were awarded to Rodney L. Merritt, Danny Bunker, Frederick Moore III, Sidney Bridges, Luther Choate and Harvey Childs.
George Openshaw was awarded a general commendation for several years of police service as a range officer; Deputy Sidney Hughes was promoted to the rank of sergeant; awards were given to outstanding civilians Shirley Anthony of East Machias, Anne Pike of Lubec, Jerry Hatch of Whiting, and Dean and Jane McGray of Addison; and certificates of appreciation for their work at the Washington County Jail were given to head cook Amy Wood and assistant cook Marilyn Fritz.

Consumer group pushes for required warning on shellfish

Abstract: Why label shellfish harvested from the Gulf of Maine, for example, when the disease-causing organism is found only in southern waters, [Lee Weddig] asked. He also said only oysters, clams and mussels can be infested with the bacteria. According to Public Voice, people most at risk of contracting Vibro vulnificus are those suffering from alcoholism, liver disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, AIDS and intestinal disease. Pregnant women and the elderly also should not eat raw or partially cooked shellfish, [Mark Epstein] said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A consumer group on Wednesday pushed for the Food and Drug Administration to require stores and restaurants to carry warnings that raw shellfish can kill.
Public Voice for Food and Health Policy said at least 13 people have died since 1992 from eating raw shellfish containing Vibrio vulnificus. The organism occurs naturally in coastal waters, especially in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer.
"While raw shellfish can be a delicious appetizer, for the elderly, those with liver disease, and those with immune system disorders such as AIDS, it can also be a game of seafood roulette," Public Voice President Mark Epstein said.
But the National Restaurant Association and the National Fisheries Institute oppose the warning. Only medical professionals are prepared to educate consumers about the dangers of eating raw or undercooked shellfish, the groups said.
"It's too sweeping and too dire," said Lee Weddig, executive vice president of the Institute. The group represents 1,000 seafood companies, including 30 from Maine.
Why label shellfish harvested from the Gulf of Maine, for example, when the disease-causing organism is found only in southern waters, Weddig asked. He also said only oysters, clams and mussels can be infested with the bacteria.
Weddig said it makes more sense to have individual states decide whether to have warning labels for shellfish. Presently, California, Florida and Louisiana require these notices.
According to Public Voice, people most at risk of contracting Vibro vulnificus are those suffering from alcoholism, liver disease, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, AIDS and intestinal disease. Pregnant women and the elderly also should not eat raw or partially cooked shellfish, Epstein said.
He accused the FDA of dragging its feet in requiring the warning labels. Public Voice has been pushing for the warning for two years.
"How many more deaths will it take before the FDA acts to protect these vulnerable consumers?" Epstein asked. Brad Stone, an FDA spokesman, said the agency is considering the proposal.

Aquaculture lacks federal support Cohen says marine harvest programs need more government attention

Author: John S. Day Of the NEWS Staff

Abstract: According to [William S. Cohen], farmed salmon was Maine's second-largest selling aquaculture product in 1993, trailing only lobster. In addition to salmon, state fish farmers are producing trout, mussels and oysters, as well as a type of seaweed popular in Japan for use in sushi dishes. About one-third of all fish farming done in the Northeast is located in Maine. Most of the state's industry is found in Washington County, which experiences chronic high unemployment, Cohen noted.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- During the 1992 presidential campaign, Ross Perot often pointed out that the U.S. Department of Agriculture was so over-staffed it had approximately one federal bureaucrat overseeing each American farm.
Sen. William S. Cohen recently discovered that the department, the federal government's third-largest agency with about 113,000 civil service employees, currently assigns just a single full-time worker to assist in the development of aquaculture programs, one of the fastest-growing of Maine's resource industries.
The federal government, Cohen decided, should pay more attention to harvesting the produce of lakes, rivers and seas. The Maine senator introduced legislation Wednesday that would create a national policy for fish farming. Among other things, it would provide the state's emerging aquaculture companies equal footing with other farms for federal assistance programs.
"As health-conscious people continue to demand more and more seafood products, fish farming will rise in importance," Cohen said. "The United States, despite having vast ocean access and technical know-how, ranks only 10th in the world in terms of aquaculture production."
The Maine senator said that lack of support by federal agencies may have contributed to the industry's "poor performance."
Cohen's bill would direct the Department of Agriculture to increase its focus on fish farming by improving technology data collection, expanding disaster and loan assistance programs and improving education programs about the industry.
The legislation could boost Maine's small but emerging aquaculture industry, the senator said. That industry currently generates sales of about $45 million annually. An estimated 500 full-time workers are employed by 30 aquaculture companies.
According to Cohen, farmed salmon was Maine's second-largest selling aquaculture product in 1993, trailing only lobster. In addition to salmon, state fish farmers are producing trout, mussels and oysters, as well as a type of seaweed popular in Japan for use in sushi dishes. About one-third of all fish farming done in the Northeast is located in Maine. Most of the state's industry is found in Washington County, which experiences chronic high unemployment, Cohen noted.
"Maine's aquaculture industry is relatively new, but it is expanding rapidly," the Maine senator said.

FDA cautious on flats Resuming harvest not 1st on list

Abstract: One area he foresees checking is Eggemoggin Reach, where flats from west of the Deer Isle-Sedgwick bridge to Cape Rosier remain closed. Having been contacted by private landowners in the Weir Cove area of Brooksville who are interested in a reopening, [Paul Anderson] expects the removal of overboard discharges there, and in nearby Orcutt Harbor and Horseshoe Cove. Last year's reopening of clam flats at the Salt Pond bordered by Blue Hill, Brooklin and Sedgwick has renewed harvesters' access to a significant resource. Other areas reopened in the past year include Crockett Cove in Stonington.

Full text: LAMOINE -- A state marine biologist says increasing scrutiny by the federal government inadvertently could render reopening of closed shellfish areas in Hancock County a lower priority.
Paul Anderson of the Department of Marine Resources says it is becoming increasingly difficult to focus on the reopening of harvesting areas, closed primarily due to water-quality problems. The federal Food and Drug Administration has begun to look more closely at areas the DMR already has reopened, seeking justification for the choices and assurance that shellfish from those areas will be safe for consumers.
The paperwork involved in documenting reopenings has drawn resources away from opening more areas, said Anderson. In his five years on the job, it seems every year the FDA adds an extra layer of requirements, he said. "The FDA is really cautious about this program. They don't want anyone getting sick," he said.
Although the biologist said he will continue to direct reopenings where feasible and warranted, the department may have to respond more slowly to requests.
One area he foresees checking is Eggemoggin Reach, where flats from west of the Deer Isle-Sedgwick bridge to Cape Rosier remain closed. Having been contacted by private landowners in the Weir Cove area of Brooksville who are interested in a reopening, Anderson expects the removal of overboard discharges there, and in nearby Orcutt Harbor and Horseshoe Cove.
Removal of the discharges could result in the reopening of harvesting areas along the Reach.
The town of Sedgwick is interested in reinspection of a closed area above Bagaduce Falls. Anderson said testing at a water-quality station there suggests the water still may be compromised, but the DMR will check the area on its next trip to Sedgwick.
Last year's reopening of clam flats at the Salt Pond bordered by Blue Hill, Brooklin and Sedgwick has renewed harvesters' access to a significant resource. Other areas reopened in the past year include Crockett Cove in Stonington.

Abstract: A summary of the draft report on dioxin, leaked last week to The New York Times, confirmed what environmentalists had warned for more than a year: that an in-depth look at this toxin would produce evidence of health risks more severe than what was commonly assumed. Dioxin is a byproduct of incineration, wood and coal-burning and industrial processes that use chlorine. Trace amounts are found in dairy products, meats, fish and shellfish. Animals at the top of the food chain generally have the highest concentrations. The EPA draft -- a final report is expected early next year -- offers evidence that dioxin may cause an increase in some types of cancers, could bring on reproductive and development problems and suppress immune systems.

Full text: It is too soon to conclude that the word spilling from the Environmental Protection Agency about the effects of dioxin means tougher standards for producers of the toxin. But the draft of the EPA's long-awaited report should allow paper companies and other firms to prepare for what is likely to come.
A summary of the draft report on dioxin, leaked last week to The New York Times, confirmed what environmentalists had warned for more than a year: that an in-depth look at this toxin would produce evidence of health risks more severe than what was commonly assumed. Dioxin is a byproduct of incineration, wood and coal-burning and industrial processes that use chlorine. Trace amounts are found in dairy products, meats, fish and shellfish. Animals at the top of the food chain generally have the highest concentrations. The EPA draft -- a final report is expected early next year -- offers evidence that dioxin may cause an increase in some types of cancers, could bring on reproductive and development problems and suppress immune systems.
The research that went into these finding has yet to be reviewed by experts outside the agency and some debate has emerged among government agenices about details of the study, but the overall results of several years of gathering data point to tighter restrictions on the use of chlorine.
Arguing, as industry has, that it has already lowered chlorine use and dioxin production will not be persuasive if the EPA's findings hold up. The effort to reduce the level of dioxin in the environment mirrors a similar battle to remove lead. From gasoline to paint to solder for pipes, new sources of lead have been largely eliminated, to the benefit of children across the country.
Maine researchers found surprisingly high levels of dioxin in lobster caught off the coast last summer, leading to the warning that nursing mothers, pregnant women and women of child-bearing age should avoid eating lobster tomalley, which serves as the lobster's liver. The warning was a striking reminder that, although health, human and environmental, is the primary concern in these studies, economics -- in this case, fishing and tourist industries -- also are at risk.
A source-by-source elimination of dioxin could well follow the EPA report. Industries that produce dioxin as a byproduct, even in minute quantities, can either wait for state and federal regulations to hit them with sudden added costs or start gearing up now to be competitive without the use of chlorine.
They would be smart to start now.

Abstract: The opening two hours track what happens when a killer germ escapes from an Army base and decimates much of the population of the United States. The handful of survivors divide into two camps, based on the visions they receive, either that of the good Mother Abigail (played by Ruby Dee) or of the evil Randall Flagg (portrayed by Jamey Sheridan). The spread of the illness and end of civilization are graphically portrayed and visually riveting. Still the strong cast makes it an enjoyable ride. Standout performances include Sheridan as Randall Flagg, Gary Sinise as Stu Redman, the leader of the forces of good; Dee as Mother Abigail and Rob Lowe as silent, but strong, deaf-mute Nick Andros.

Full text: "The Stand" has finally found the proper video medium in which to flourish.
At 1,153 pages, Stephen King's epic adventure has too much going on to be condensed down into a two- or three-hour movie. ABC's eight-hour miniseries, airing at 9 p.m. Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, is closer to the needed length, although it does drag in places and seem overly long.
Still, the miniseries delivers plenty of suspense and special effects, the visual equivalent of one of King's page-turner novels.
The opening two hours track what happens when a killer germ escapes from an Army base and decimates much of the population of the United States. The handful of survivors divide into two camps, based on the visions they receive, either that of the good Mother Abigail (played by Ruby Dee) or of the evil Randall Flagg (portrayed by Jamey Sheridan). The spread of the illness and end of civilization are graphically portrayed and visually riveting.
In the following two installments, King's morality play continues with the two sides traveling either to Boulder (the site of good) or Las Vegas (the home of evil, naturally), as God and Satan struggle for their souls.
The whole production takes a healthy suspension of disbelief, especially the climactic scene.
But still the strong cast makes it an enjoyable ride. Standout performances include Sheridan as Randall Flagg, Gary Sinise as Stu Redman, the leader of the forces of good; Dee as Mother Abigail and Rob Lowe as silent, but strong, deaf-mute Nick Andros.
The supporting cast delivers other strong performances, especially Matt Frewer as the psychotic Trash-Can Man, Adam Storke as musician Larry Underwood and Ray Walston as retired professor Glen Bateman.
Lowe's fellow former Brat Packer, Molly Ringwald, doesn't fare as well, as Redman's sniveling love interest, Fran Goldsmith. Also, some of the supporting forces of evil, including Corin Nemec's Harold Lauder and Shawnee Smith's Julie Lawry, don't seem as well developed as the good guys.
Despite being on the small screen, "The Stand" comes through with sweeping tableaus, both of destruction and nature. The $28 million budget shows up on screen. The production is also enhanced by the music, such as Blue Oyster Cult's "Don't Fear the Reaper" over the opening credits.
So while "The Stand" won't take a place among the great miniseries of all time, it's among the best network productions in the past several years.

Rigid shellfish rules a surprise to dealers

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]07 May 1994.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/413717185?accountid=10457

Abstract: PORTLAND (AP) -- Some Maine shellfish dealers say they'll have to raise their prices or pay clam diggers less to compensate for the expense of strict sanitation guidelines being enforced this spring. Because their operations do not comply with the rules, two-thirds of the dealers have yet to secure licenses they need to sell clams, oysters and mussels. As a result, they risk fines, prosecution and seizure of shellfish they continue to sell.

Full text: PORTLAND (AP) -- Some Maine shellfish dealers say they'll have to raise their prices or pay clam diggers less to compensate for the expense of strict sanitation guidelines being enforced this spring.
The guidelines apparently caught many of Maine's 126 shellfish dealers off-guard.
Because their operations do not comply with the rules, two-thirds of the dealers have yet to secure licenses they need to sell clams, oysters and mussels. As a result, they risk fines, prosecution and seizure of shellfish they continue to sell.
William J. Brennan, commissioner of the state Department of Marine Resources, said Maine has no choice but to comply with the standards developed by an interstate commission.
Failure to do so, he said, could lead other states to clamp an embargo on Maine shellfish, endangering the $12.3 million-a-year industry.
"There may be elements of the plan that are too strident from a producer's perspective," said Brennan. "But the bottom line is these are standards we must adhere to, to engage in interstate commerce."
Brennan said most dealers are working to bring their operations into compliance, but he acknowledged that some may not be able to survive. As of Thursday morning, about 40 had been certified, a DMR official said.
The guidelines, which are being strictly enforced for the first time, are intended to meet consumer concerns about shellfish safety.

Full text: STONINGTON -- Town manager Roger Stone hopes anticipated improvements will make the municipal airport more aircraft-friendly.
The town is seeking funds from the Maine Department of Transportation for regrading and paving at the facility. Agency spokesman Ron Ray said this week that the project appears viable, and could be funded this summer once the formal application process is complete.
According to Town Manager Stone, many aircraft owners fear using the airport because debris from the dirt runway can damage airplane propellers. He estimated the improvement project would cost a maximum of $160,000, with the state funding up to 90 percent and airport users the rest.
One of 37 municipal airports in the state, the facility built in the 1950s is used primarily by businesses transporting items such as shellfish products and by individual aircraft owners.
Although the airport is used by only a minority of residents, the town would rely on it for emergency transport were the Deer Isle-Stonington bridge to become unusable even temporarily, Stone said.

Full text: I am a shellfish biologist and ecologist as well as a former clam digger from Jonesport who has a serious concern about the health of the clamming industry in eastern Maine. Clamming is a traditional form of employment among coastal communities, especially in Washington and Hancock counties where, historically, between 45 to 75 percent of all clams in Maine are harvested.
According to statistics provided by the Maine Department of Marine Resources, during the period between 1984 and 1992, clam landings in these two counties declined by approximately 90 percent. Landings in Knox and Waldo counties also declined by about 82 percent during this same period. Curiously, clam landings in the four southwestern coastal counties rose by 20 percent.
My goal is to keep shouting loud enough so that someday people will know ____________________________________________________________________ __________and understand that a clam flat can be, with proper management and stewardship, ____________________________________________________________________ ____________to a coastal community like Jonesport what Georgia-Pacific is to the town of ____________________________________________________________________ __________Woodland: an economic boon. ______________________________ As a scientist, I wonder what the difference is between southern Maine and eastern Maine when it comes to natural clam abundance. What I know is that there are relatively few seed clams (individuals less than a year old or one inch) in eastern Maine where I have conducted research since 1984, compared with areas south of the St. Georges River. As a student at the University of Maine at Machias from 1975 to 1979, I assisted Dr. John Commito with studies of clam populations in flats in Lubec, Jonesboro, and Harrington. Why is there no comparison between numbers of seed occurring on flats then and now?
What is so different about eastern vs. southwestern coastal Maine besides the obvious differences in geography, seasonal water temperatures, riverine inputs, and perhaps geology? One fact is that flats Down East are not managed nearly as carefully as flats in the southern areas.
Good management does not come from luck, it costs, and since more public funds are available in Cumberland vs. Washington county, southwest coastal clam management programs are decades ahead of most feeble attempts here in eastern Maine. Can management alone explain the disparity? I estimate that since 1984, approximately 1,800 full-time and part-time jobs have been lost in Washington and Hancock counties due to the loss of the clamming industry. Each year fewer and fewer persons harvest clams in eastern Maine and still the clams do not seem to rebound, yet clammers in the southwestern counties fight each other for licenses because the resource is so abundant.
Apparently differences in harvesting intensity do little to help explain ____________________________________________________________________ __________the situation. Clammers in eastern Maine have a variety of explanations for the ____________________________________________________________________ ____________decline that vary from natural cycles, increased levels of worm digging, the ____________________________________________________________________ _________two-inch clam law, and now, Velpar. ______________________________________ I was quoted in a BDN article by Ned Porter (April 13) that focused attention on trace amounts of the herbicide Velpar (also known as hexazinone) showing up in wells near some blueberry fields as well as several Down East rivers near and dear to the hearts of salmon fishermen. I mentioned the fact that Velpar was first licensed for use on Maine's blueberry fields in 1984 which is when clam landings began to decline. This may be coincidental, or a spurious correlation. The fact is that no one really knows what happens to this herbicide when it enters the marine environment. We do know from the published literature that hexazinone is considered to have low toxicity to animals.
When administered to mice and rats it is rapidly absorbed and does not ____________________________________________________________________ ________accumulate preferentially in any tissue. Exposures at concentrations of 2,500 ____________________________________________________________________ __________to 5,000 ppm did not cause development abnormalities or mutagenic effects. ____________________________________________________________________ _______Short-term exposure studies in several species of fish, including juvenile ____________________________________________________________________ _______Pacific salmonids, indicated that levels maintained between 300-400 ppm would ____________________________________________________________________ __________usually kill 50 percent of the subjects within 96 hours. These levels are 1,000 ____________________________________________________________________ ____________times higher than those that have shown up in wells or in river water. ____________________________________________________________________ _____ Hexazinone is effective against some species of algae. A 1977 laboratory ____________________________________________________________________ _________study concluded that two to three weeks of exposure to concentrations of 1 ppm ____________________________________________________________________ ___________was sufficient to kill some species of macro- and microalgae. Because nobody ____________________________________________________________________ _________knows specifically what the level concentrations of hexazinone are for either ____________________________________________________________________ __________adult or larval clams, as a scientist, I think it should be investigated. ____________________________________________________________________
________ Because many clam flats in eastern Maine occur
adjacent to blueberry ____________________________________________________________________ ______fields, or are at the mouths of rivers that drain blueberry barrens, I think ____________________________________________________________________ _________that we owe it to ourselves and the clamming industry (or what passes for it ____________________________________________________________________ _________now) to investigate such things as microalgal densities, clam reproductive ____________________________________________________________________ _______output, and clam recruitment (the development stage of going from a swimming ____________________________________________________________________ _________larvae to a bottom dweller) in these and other areas. ________________________________________________________ Only through the use of carefully designed, unbiased, and well-replicated studies can we ever hope to pass judgment on whether Velpar (or any other chemical) plays a role in influencing the distribution and abundance of soft-shell clams. Until such time when critical and rigorous research is funded and carried out, we can only continue to speculate about the truth. This is neither productive nor satisfying and will never lead to unambiguous conclusions. Brian F. Beal is an assistant professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias.

Full text: UNITY -- Dr. Jim Chacko, head of Unity College's aquaculture program, says the college's new teaching facility will enable it to train more graduates to work in one of the state's fastest growing industries.
The most interesting part of the facility, which opened this month, is the wet laboratory which houses tanks where students are exposed to raising fish under different conditions.
"It's a totally enclosed system," Chacko said this week. "Everything is recycled and recirculated. No new water gets added to the tanks. The whole idea is to give the students hands-on training. When they get out of here they won't have any problems. No culture shocks."
The wet laboratory replicates both fresh and salt water environments. Atlantic salmon and brook trout swim together in the large tanks, providing students with the opportunity to study fish up close.
"This is undergraduate education at its best with hands-on experience," Chacko said. "They handle the fish, they feed the fish. It the fish dies, they get a poor grade...just kidding."
Chacko is also a certified fish pathologist and is known to students as "Fish Quincy," a comparison to the television series about a crime-solving medical examiner. His sense of humor is evident in the layout of his department. Instead of numbered doors on the classrooms, they are labeled with fish names.
Chacko explained that the aquaculture industry supported the program with grants and by offering students intern positions at fish farms and hatcheries.
In Maine alone there are nine private hatcheries that produced 13 million pounds of salmon, steelhead or trout and employed upwards of 250 people in 1992. The state also has three shellfish farms that last year produced 1 million pounds of mussels and 1.2 million pounds of oysters and provided work for 50 residensts.
The emphasis of the Unity College program is on cold water species. "If somebody wants to come and raise catfish this is not the ideal place," he said.
The "rigorous program" is designed to handle 12 students each semester. Classes run the gamut from identifying diseases to nutrition and, most importantly, water quality.
"When you are dealing with this type of industry that is critical. If the water gets fouled, the first thing to go will be the fish," Chacko said. "We have all the basics here to run a real good undergraduate program."

Food and water are being poisoned

Abstract: Velpar isn't the worst of the poisons sprayed on our blueberries, cranberries, potatoes, apples, and other food crops in Maine. For example, the label for Guthion, which attacks the central nervous system, reads that Guthion poisoning causes, among other awful sympoms, "convulsions, low blood pressure, cardiac irregularities, loss of reflexes, coma, and, in extreme cases, death." Guthion is classified as highly hazardous to humans. Both Velapr and Guthion are sprayed from helicopters, and everyone's blueberry fields are done at once. So several times each spring and summer, we're trapped in a huge poison gas chamber, forced to breathe these known poisons: The helicopters spray Guthion, Velpar, Funginex, etc., right down to the ocean, drifting poison into clam fats and fisheries. Poisons travel down our rivers from the blueberry barrens and cranberry bogs into the coastal waters. Damage: loss of fish and shellfish for our local food supply, loss of clamming, fishing, and other marine-related jobs. Even though it's illegal, Guthion is often sprayed while honeybees are in the blueberry fields, killing them. Maine beekeepers would like to make a dollar renting bees to growers, but can't afford the losses. Spraying also kills Maine's natural pollinating insects, making us dependent on miteinfested, diseased, possibly killer bee-crossed bees coming up from the South. Damage: loss of natural pollinators, loss of honey for food, loss of beekeeper jobs.

Full text: Now that Velpar has been found in Atlantic salmon habitat, surely there's going to be an uproar. Good. It's about time, even if Atlantic salmon seem to generate more concern than human beings. I'll take it over nothing.
Regarding toxicity, the Velpar label states that DuPont Chemical Co.'s scientists:
(1) poured Velpar into rabbits' eyes and found that Velpar is corrosive to (destroys) eyes;
(2) force-fred Velpar to mice, rats, and dogs (where do they get dogs for their experiments?) until they observed "effects" and death;
(3) use Ethanol as the spraying agent in Velpar, which can cause liver, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive damage.
And more. Not something I'd want in my water supply.
But Velpar isn't the worst of the poisons sprayed on our blueberries, cranberries, potatoes, apples, and other food crops in Maine. For example, the label for Guthion, which attacks the central nervous system, reads that Guthion poisoning causes, among other awful sympoms, "convulsions, low blood pressure, cardiac irregularities, loss of reflexes, coma, and, in extreme cases, death." Guthion is classified as highly hazardous to humans.
Both Velapr and Guthion are sprayed from helicopters, and everyone's blueberry fields are done at once. So several times each spring and summer, we're trapped in a huge poison gas chamber, forced to breathe these known poisons: The helicopters spray Guthion, Velpar, Funginex, etc., right down to the ocean, drifting poison into clam fats and fisheries. Poisons travel down our rivers from the blueberry barrens and cranberry bogs into the coastal waters. Damage: loss of fish and shellfish for our local food supply, loss of clamming, fishing, and other marine-related jobs.
Even though it's illegal, Guthion is often sprayed while honeybees are in the blueberry fields, killing them. Maine beekeepers would like to make a dollar renting bees to growers, but can't afford the losses. Spraying also kills Maine's natural pollinating insects, making us dependent on miteinfested, diseased, possibly killer bee-crossed bees coming up from the South. Damage: loss of natural pollinators, loss of honey for food, loss of beekeeper jobs.
Washington County's deer herd has been mysteriously disappearing for years. Some blame coyotes, but other areas have plenty of deer along with coyotes. I blame poisoned blueberries, of which deer eat many. Damage: loss of deer for local food supply, loss of hunting-related jobs.
Using pesticides and harvesting machines is killing the hand-weeding and many, many raking (harvesting) jobs. Last year, Cherryfield Foods, which is Canadian owned and the largest blueberry grower around here, brought in a dozen harvester machines from Nova Scotia to harvest their 7,000 acres, and shipped the harvested blueberries to Nova Scotia for processing. Then they bid on and won a USDA contract for 3-4 million pounds of blueberries for America's schoolchildren, all full of pesticides. Damage: health of our children, loss of weeding, raking, and local processing jobs, loss of profits to foreign country, hurting local blueberry growers and processors.
Fish in cages (salmon aquaculture) can't swim away from poisons, so they sicken, and are then medicated. These antibiotics and other medications add to the unwanted chemicals in our coastal waters, and in some cases create dead zones below salmon cages. Damage: unhealthy fish equals unhealthy food for people, greater mortality fof fish.
By poisoning coastal waters, our entire ecosystem is damaged. If there are few fish, shellfish, and other organisms, what will the shore birds, offshore birds, ducks, mammals, and reptiles eat? Damage: Collapse of food chain, loss of our food supply, loss of jobs.
The scientists have gotten us into this mess, and we, using our common sense, will have to get ourselves out of it. Looking at the world today, I've seen enough of science and technology for the moment.
Everyone, and that includes home gardeners, needs to stop using toxic chemicals. There are still traces of DDT around, for Pete's sake. We've got to give the earth and all the creatures on it, including ourselves, a chance to purge ourselves of the poisons we've been forced to ingest.
There are perfectly reasonable, common sense ways to grow food crops without poisons, and they are being done right now. Organic blueberries grown in Maine always bring at least a dollar a pound wholesale in the Portland-Boston market, which is crying for more. Sprayed blueberries brought 25 cents a pound last year and probably will bring no more this year.
People want unsprayed, organically grown food. This could be Maine's market strategy. Maine could be "The Clean One." Growers have been trading on the public's perception of Maine as "pristine," when we know it isn't true. It's past time to make the reality fit the perception.
It is unlikely "jobs" as such will come wandering into Maine. Reading the business pages one learns that industry and agriculture are becoming so chemical- and machine-dependent that jobs are scarce worldwide. What I want to know is, who will buy the products these super-efficient companies produce if so few of us have good jobs?
If we can assume we're mostly on our own to survive, and I think we are, then we should plan for more community self-sufficiency. Therefore, we citizens are going to need more control over our local natural resources: woods, waters, fields, streams, clean air and what gets dumped into all of them. We might even try something I've read about called "democracy." It's where you and I get to make the decisions that affect our lives.
No magical moneymen are going to come up here and help us; it's strictly up to us. But we have to stop the poisoning of our food supply and water or there won't be anything left to worry about.
And to those who whine that they must poison our water, air, and woods in order to create "jobs," remember this: There are no jobs on a dead planet.

Full text: New information that Velpar has been detected in Down East rivers has heightened concerns over the use of the herbicide that revolutionized Maine's blueberry industry.
An uproar followed reports last fall that Velpar was detected in several wells. Now comes news that very low levels of Velpar were discovered last summer in the Narraguagus River, its West Branch and the Pleasant River by researchers for the Maine Atlantic Sea Run Salmon Commission. They were looking for reasons behind the steady decline in the numbers of salmon returning to rivers Down East.
To date none of the detected levels of Velpar even approach what the U.S Environmental Protection Agency considers unsafe, but an EPA official said the agency is reinvestigating its data to determine whether to lower the limits.
Federal officials are considering whether Atlantic salmon warrant protection as an endangered species. The discovery of Velpar in salmon rivers only adds to the problems of a blueberry industry that is beginning to feel besieged.
When Velpar was found in wells in Aurora, Franklin and Gouldsboro residents around the blueberry barrens started agitating for changes to protect their drinking water. Some people in the shellfish industry also point to the use of Velpar as one reason for declining clam harvests.
"We're facing problems from many fronts, salmon, clams, the EPA, the public," said Edward J. McLaughlin, executive director of the Maine Blueberry Commission. "We seem to be getting blamed by anybody with a problem near a blueberry field.
"It's an emotional issue. All of the science in the world won't matter. People say, `I just don't want it,' " he said. "My belief is that the truth will surface somewhere along the line. My job is to keep this from hurting the industry the way Alar did the apple industry."
Five years ago, the apple industry took a beating after alarming reports that Alar, a chemical ripener, was suspected of causing cancer. The manufacturer subsequently stopped selling it.
A herbicide with the generic name hexazinone, Velpar is manufactured by DuPont Agricultural Products. The chemical controls weeds, killing them by interfering with photosynthesis. It is used by highway crews along roadsides and by farmers on alfalfa and sugarcane.
More than a dozen years ago someone noticed that blueberries came back stronger in the right of ways where hexazinone was applied. Maine blueberry growers first used it in 1983 and it is now in widespread use by the industry.
Wild blueberries are harvested in alternate years. On the fields left to vegetate, Velpar is applied in the spring with boom sprayers mounted on tractors. No license is required to buy it and no training is needed to apply it.
About 30,000 gallons a year are used, half a gallon per acre. The amount is half of what was applied during the height of its use several years ago, said David E. Yarborough, a blueberry specialist at the University of Maine. He added that use of the chemical has so reduced the growth of weeds that growers can apply less. Velpar has never been found on harvested blueberries.
Ten years ago there were 50,000 acres of blueberries. This year, with 600 growers, there will be about 58,000 acres. Fifteen years ago the harvest amounted to 20 million pounds. The annual average is now 60 million pounds.
It amounts to a $100 million industry, which provides about 1,000 jobs year round and 8,000 seasonally. Wild blueberries grow in every county of Maine except Aroostook. But more than 70 percent of the industry is in Hancock and Washington counties.
"It's been absolutely phenomenal what it's done for the industry," McLaughlin said.
A little more than 98 percent of crop is used as an ingredient in other products -- muffin mixes, chewing gum and the like. It is a bright spot in an otherwise beleagured Maine economy. McLaughlin has worked to develop markets for wild Maine blueberries as far afield as Israel.
"A large part of that can be attributed to Velpar. The biggest problem in the fields is weeds," he said. "Once we could control the weeds, we could do other things to increase production, apply feritilizer, irrigate and harvest mechanically."
However, the chemical is water soluble and readily migrates through the right kind of soils. So it turns up in the groundwater and water bodies near the fields.
The EPA currently classifies hexazinone as "practically non-toxic" to fish, water bugs and mollusks, and "slightly toxic" for crustaceans. And, for the time being, the EPA has issued a human health advisory for concentrations of 210 parts per billion.
DuPont is in the process of reregistering the chemical with the EPA. Based on new data and new analysis of existing data, the agency could lower the level to as little as 20 parts per billion. Al Heier, an EPA spokesman, said that the question is still open and that scientists are debating how likely Velpar is to cause cancer.
The herbicide is considered a severe eye irritant but is not likely to be hazardous if ingested according to a DuPont safety data sheet.
Nowhere on the Narraguagus River or its West Branch were levels of more than 1 part per billion found. Levels in some tributaries that drain the barrens ranged as high as 4.79 ppb.
The highest level in the Pleasant River, 1.53 ppb, was found at Saco Falls.
At one spot on Pork Brook Barrens, west of Route 193 and south of Route 9, the ground water tested as high as 32.51 ppb.
The concentration of hexazinone in the well for the Gouldsboro School was 6 parts per billion, for the Airline Community School in Aurora it was 8.9 ppb, and for a potential well in Franklin it was 4 ppb.
The findings raised fears and questions. After the discovery at the Airline School, officials switched to bottled drinking water until a filtration system was installed.
A meeting on the matter held by the Maine Board of Pesticide Control two months ago in Ellsworth drew more than 60 people. One person who attended the meeting was Geneva Duncan, a mother of two children who graduated from the Airline Community School.
"Can you tell me that it didn't do any harm to my children?" she said. "It hasn't killed anybody yet, but I don't feel at ease with this."
The clamming industry Down East has fallen on hard times in the last decade. People casting about for a cause see an increase in Velpar use coinciding with a decrease in the clam harvest.
"Maybe its a spurious correlation but not much else has changed, harvesting pressure or development of coastal industries," said Brian Beal, an assistant professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. "Add it up. It begs the question, does Velpar have an effect?"
Beal wants to find out whether there are any trace amounts of the herbicide in the marine environment and whether there are differences between mud flats next to blueberry fields and those at a distance. He is seeking funding, about $75,000, for the two-year project.
Traces of Velpar started turning up in Down East rivers in 1991 after salmon officials began their investigation into the declining populations. Since then they have discovered more of the herbicide.
It is more likely that researchers got better at finding Velpar than the amount of it actually increased, said Kenneth Beland, a scientist with the commission.
"I'm not saying this has no impact. These fish are growing up in some areas of the watershed where there's a chronic background level of the chemical," he said. "We can't answer whether it's acting on a subtle level on the fish."
Nothing else is on the market that will serve the blueberry industry as well as hexazinone, Yarborough said. "There are alternative strategies. They can be more effective but would require more management and more labor."
An alternative includes cutting the weeds, which is effective against dogbane and ferns. Additionally growers can apply Velpar and other herbicides more selectively.
"Cutting down on the use of Velpar not only makes sense for the public but it can make financial sense," Yarborough said.
With the public growing increasingly wary of chemicals in the environment as well as contaminated food and water, the Maine industry is working overtime to address the problem.
"We're trying to be right up front," McLaughlin said. "We're spending about $50,000 directly and indirectly on the issue this year. We're funding research.

Abstract: Carter Newall of Great Eastern Mussel Farms in St. George explained how shellfish production is a good economic argument for clean water. Newall, who has played an active role in research into aquaculture, said a successful aquaculture venture must be built on sound environmental policy.

Full text: CASTINE -- Aquaculture ventures are writing a promising chapter in the history of Maine's economic and environmental links to the sea, according to the general manager of a salmon aquaculture business on Swans Island.
Sonny Sprague of the Island Aquaculture Co. spoke Saturday at the Penobscot Bay Conference at Maine Maritime Academy. It was the second consecutive year for the conference that drew more than 100 people who considered the economic and environmental health of the region at several workshops during the day.
As a lifetime resident of a year-round island community, Sprague said the aquaculture business provides a livelihood to island residents while preserving the environmental health of the coastal waters.
Ken Curtis, president of MMA, underlined the importance of marine industries in his opening remarks. Listing Maine's three basic resources -- people, forests and the ocean -- Curtis said action must be taken to protect the sea.
Sprague explained how he and others had turned to the sea to ensure the long-term health and vitality of their year-round island community that had seen its young people leave and never return for lack of employment opportunities.
The former Swans Island selectman and a handful of others on the island in Frenchman Bay purchased the financially ailing company last year and managed to turn a profit. The bitterly cold conditions this winter spelled near disaster for the penned fish but quick processing saved the lot.
For Sprague and many others on Swans Island, aquaculture is providing a livelihood to the island community that historically has made its living from the sea.
Carter Newall of Great Eastern Mussel Farms in St. George explained how shellfish production is a good economic argument for clean water. Newall, who has played an active role in research into aquaculture, said a successful aquaculture venture must be built on sound environmental policy.
Newall said that research about eelgrass has proven that the marine flowering plant is vital for many species of coastal marine life, such as juvenile fish and shellfish, particularly young mussels. That information, Newall said, demonstrates the connections between economic and environmental health.
According to Les Watling of the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center, Penobscot Bay is home for a least 1,000 species of invertebrate animals and a perfect place for aquaculture.

Full text: MONCTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- The prosecution is seeking precedent-setting fines and hefty license suspensions for six fishermen convicted of possessing undersized lobster and fishing lobster in a closed zone.
The six fishermen from Pointe Sapin, New Brunswick, were charged after fisheries officers injected ultraviolet ink into lobsters found in traps in a closed fishing zone and monitored where the shellfish were taken.
The fishermen are: Antoine V. Daigle, 56; Gerard Luc Daigle, 38; Eloi Robichaud, 59; Isidore Jr. Martin, 32; Jean Martin, 30; and Rene Savoie, 18.
All six were either boat captains or helpers on lobster boats.
In addition, buyer Remi Cormier, 28, of Richibucto, New Brunswick, in whose truck the poached and undersized lobsters were found, was convicted of illegal possession of lobster.
Sentencing was scheduled for April 15.
Crown prosecutor Alyre Boucher told Wednesday's sentencing hearing that past fines for identical crimes have averaged between $1,000 and $3,000, with license suspensions imposed for the first three to 10 days of the lobster season -- the most lucrative time of the season.
Boucher called the crimes major offenses by professional fishermen who ought to have known better. Worse still were prior related convictions on the part of Antoine and Gerard Daigle.

Full text: PORTLAND (AP) -- Maine fishermen had their largest commercial fish harvest in 30 years last year, despite dwindling stocks of cod, haddock and other groundfish.
Last year's harvest peaked at 252 million pounds worth about $224.7 million -- breaking a record for revenue set in 1992.
"I would say, overall, when you look at all the pessimism bestowed on the fishing industry, this is a real eye-opener," said Robert Morrill, who compiles statistics for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
"This shows that the fishing industry hasn't rolled over and died," he said.
The decline in groundfish was compensated by strong catches of sea urchins, herring, lobster and other ocean creatures.
"The hallmark of Maine's fishery is diversification," said Penn Estabrook, deputy commissioner of the Department of Marine Resources.
Millions of pounds of fish and shellfish are brought to Maine ports each year, most caught in the Gulf of Maine and on the Georges Bank fishing ground. The amount of fish landed is a barometer of the overall well-being of the state's fishing industry.
It also shows the strength of the Portland Fish Exchange.

Abstract: The influence of Colby College is responsible for the "flavor" of some of the restaurants, said [David Savage]. The Lebanese restaurants are an indication of the large Lebanese population in Waterville. Others restaurants simply are reflections of personal preferences, he said. One of Waterville's most unusual menus can be found at the Down Under Pub in the Concourse downtown. True to its Australian name, the Down Under offers kangaroo, emu and alligator, alongside pizza and sandwiches. For six years, owner Doug Hachey has cashed in on the Crocodile Dundee craze, offering deep-fried alligator bits, kangaroo steak, marinated emu and alligator parmesan to his most adventurous customers. The menu is exotic: shawarma (beef or chicken breast, marinated with special spices, skewered and roasted), falafel (ground chick peas, fava beans, parsley and garlic, blended and fried), hummus (chick peas blended with tahini sauce, garlic and oil), and tabbouleh (fresh parsley and tomato salad with onion, cracked wheat and oil.) And then there are the pies: sfeha with ground beef and onions, or zaatar with thyme and sesame seeds.

Full text: If you have a craving for a Lebanese lamb kebob, head to Waterville. Or how about an emu steak or an alligator rib? For a special experience, try a dish called Seven Stars Around the Moon. Top it all off with a cup of Hawaiian coffee or some very English tea.
For a number of reasons, Waterville is fast becoming known for the variety of ethnic food available at its restaurants, pubs and gourmet shops.
"We certainly have some fabulous dining here," said David Savage, president of the Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce. "There are a lot of fine restaurants providing some great eating experiences."
The influence of Colby College is responsible for the "flavor" of some of the restaurants, said Savage. The Lebanese restaurants are an indication of the large Lebanese population in Waterville. Others restaurants simply are reflections of personal preferences, he said.
"There really is something for everyone," said the Chamber president.
Last summer, the city held "A Greater Taste of Waterville" festival, which allowed all the local restaurants to participate. More than 1,000 people ate outdoors on tables set up in the streets, said Savage.
"It was the ultimate outdoor cafe and an incredible experience," said Savage.
One of Waterville's most unusual menus can be found at the Down Under Pub in the Concourse downtown. True to its Australian name, the Down Under offers kangaroo, emu and alligator, alongside pizza and sandwiches. For six years, owner Doug Hachey has cashed in on the Crocodile Dundee craze, offering deep-fried alligator bits, kangaroo steak, marinated emu and alligator parmesan to his most adventurous customers.
The atmophere of the pub, which is located beneath the Concourse, is very Australian: boomerangs, koalas, alligators and a shadow-box display of Australian groceries line the walls. Hachey says that most of those trying the imported delights do so for fun.
"We actually have a lot of summer camp counselors from Australia and New Zealand, however, that come in looking for a taste of home," he said.
Hachey said alligator is "a cross between pork and chicken. We use a special seasoning and deep fry the tidbits for an interesting snack."
Hachey said kangaroo and emu meat is tough, but with creative marinades and cooking methods, they can be "very nice."
The pub will soon add a nightclub, The Outback, upstairs where the Australian theme and food will continue.
Painted on the windows of Jorgensen's Main Street cafe is the motto, "A cup o' Joe is a wonderful thing," and when it is brewed at Jorgensen's, it truly is. A dozen carafes tantalize the visitor, offering a variety of hot coffee: hazelnut, French vanilla, rain forest nut. The little cafe also offers everything you need to grind, drip, brew, press, pour and enjoy coffee.
Jorgensen's has teas, in bulk and bag, from every country that has a tea bush. The cafe also offers an equally exotic variety of wines, coffees, and spices. Specialty mustards, extracts and garnishes fill the shelves. Irish cookies, English marmalade, Chinese fish sauce and Hawaiian coffee beans also entice patrons.
Recently expanded, Jorgensen's features outside tables in the summer. Inside, the booths are intimate, each with its own table lamp. Music from silent films of the 1920s fills the air.
The deli offers a wide range of international food, everything from curry chicken salad to peanut butter sandwiches. Pasta in a variety of flavors is made fresh daily to compliment the wide array of specialty cheeses and meats from around the world.
Two speciality businesses offer Lebanese fare: The Lebanese Bakery on Temple Street and Sitoo's Restaurant on Union Street.
The Lebanese Bakery makes all its creations "without modern processors, chopping it all by hand," said owner Salim Nasr. For 12 years, the bakery has been offering ethnic fare to Waterville's 300 Lebanese families.
The menu is exotic: shawarma (beef or chicken breast, marinated with special spices, skewered and roasted), falafel (ground chick peas, fava beans, parsley and garlic, blended and fried), hummus (chick peas blended with tahini sauce, garlic and oil), and tabbouleh (fresh parsley and tomato salad with onion, cracked wheat and oil.) And then there are the pies: sfeha with ground beef and onions, or zaatar with thyme and sesame seeds.
And, of course, there is the traditional Lebanese dessert, baklava.
Sitoo's, another Lebanese restaurant, also has baklava. The eating place, which has been at its location for 18 years, offers several lamb dishes, including kibbe.
"Kibbe is the Lebanese version of a meat loaf," said owner John Coro. "We use many spices, especially cinnamon and bulgur in the recipe."
The menu includes sweetbreads poached in wine and several American dishes.
All Sitoo's offerings are handmade on the premises, said Coro, except the baklava. "There is an elderly lady next door that used to own the restaurant," said Coro. "She still makes that in her kitchen, fresh every day."
And of course there are the Chinese restaurants: Mei Lam Lau in the JFK Mall, mostly Chinese offerings; Jade Island on the West River Road, specializing in Cantonese; Mei Chow in the Concourse; Triple Dragon at Elm Plaza; and Hunan Legends on Temple Street, specializing in Szechwan and Hunan style food.
At Jade Island, manager Tony Lee says his customers rave about a special dish called Seven Stars Around The Moon. The specialty consists of seven fantailed shrimp, chicken stuffed with Virginia ham, which battered and deep fried, Chinese vegetables, barbecue roast pork and rice.
At Hunan Legends, co-owner Dale Edwards said the most popular dish is General Tso's Chicken.
"It is a hot, spicy dish, prepared with chunks of lightly battered and deep fried chicken breast, with a very special sauce," said Edwards.
King Tran, owner of the Triple Dragon Chinese Restaurant said his customers' favorite is The Chef's Special, a rich combination of vegetables, beef and roast pork in oyster sauce.

Full text: SCARBOROUGH -- He may have to sleep in his van, eat raw potatoes and forgo showers for a month, but Roy Banks isn't missing out on a commercial clamming license this year.
The 52-year-old Scarborough man says he'll camp in the Town Hall parking lot for a month to ensure that he will get one of the three commercial clamming licenses up for grabs this year.
Banks pulled his red van into the parking lot on March 22. He doesn't intend to leave until April 20, when the shellfish licenses will be distributed.
Banks' monthlong wait would set a record in Scarborough. Other Maine towns have abandoned the first-come, first-served system and instead distribute shellfish licenses by lottery.
Wearing a red sock hat, sweater, jeans and ski jacket, Banks said he's been "very miserable, very uncomfortable" living in his van. But, he said, "It's what you have to do."
Dick Haehnel, the town's shellfish conservation officer, said Banks is assured of getting one of the $100 licenses if he doesn't leave town property. If he leaves, he could lose his spot to other would-be clammers.
Banks said he closed down an upholstery business a year ago because he wanted a freer life, one that would allow him to spend more time outdoors.
He was too late to get a commercial license, so he settled for a recreational license. But that limited his take to one peck of clams per day. Haehnel caught him once for violating that rule.
This year, Banks wanted to make sure he didn't miss out on a commercial license.
So last week he loaded up the van with an old cot, sleeping bag, Army blankets, clean underwear and slippers. He eats raw potatoes and other vegetables and heats canned beef stew on a small butane burner.
When it's open, he goes into Town Hall to use the bathroom and take "bird baths" in the restroom sink. He exercises by walking laps around the lot. He passes time by listening to the radio and reading up on clamming.

Abstract: The [Rachel Carson] NWR land acquisition bill is part of an ongoing appropriation from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Those monies comes not from taxes, but from the sale of off-shore oil leases. Congress long ago agreed that these monies should be used to fund conservation projects of national significance. And Rachel Carson NWR is of national significance. Duck hunters and bird watchers all along the Eastern flyway benefit from the conservation of these lands. Our fishing industry also benefits, as well as folks anywhere who like to eat Maine seafood because these salt marshes provide a tremendous nutrient supply that our finfish and shellfish resources require. All of these pursuits generate millions for our national as well as our local economies.

Full text: A recent article, "Lobbying group derides wasteful spending," described the Citizens Against Government Waste's 1994 list of so-called pork-barrel appropriation bills. The group accused Sen. Mitchell of playing the largest role in the passage of allegedly wasteful appropriations that benefit Maine.
The article also detailed CAGW's criteria for pork-barrel spending bills. These included items arising from only one chamber of Congress, items that greatly exceed the previous year's budget request or funding level, and items that "serve only a local interest."
I'm glad that NEWS writer John Day included CAGW's criteria list because it shows how this so-called citizen group, whose co-chair is national columnist Jack Anderson, is at best ill-informed. A brief look at some facts about just one of the eight Maine projects listed, a $2 million bill to acquire additional salt marsh estuaries at Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, witnesses their inaccuracy.
The Rachel Carson NWR land acquisition bill is part of an ongoing appropriation from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Those monies comes not from taxes, but from the sale of off-shore oil leases. Congress long ago agreed that these monies should be used to fund conservation projects of national significance. And Rachel Carson NWR is of national significance. Duck hunters and bird watchers all along the Eastern flyway benefit from the conservation of these lands. Our fishing industry also benefits, as well as folks anywhere who like to eat Maine seafood because these salt marshes provide a tremendous nutrient supply that our finfish and shellfish resources require. All of these pursuits generate millions for our national as well as our local economies.
Rachel Carson NWR has received acquisition funding every fiscal year since 1987, except for last year, when Maine's share of this national fund went to important projects at Moosehorn and Petit Manaan National Wildlife refuges and Acadia National Park. Rachel Carson NWR got zero acquisition money last year -- that's why this year's appropriation exceeds last year's.
Because of the importance of these estuaries, all members of Maine's congressional delegation for the past seven years have supported appropriations from this non-tax fund for acquisition of these special areas from willing sellers.
We in southern Maine who are aware of the importance of this project are grateful to the entire Maine delegation, including Olympia Snowe -- who we can't even vote for down here -- for their consistent support.
So who is the CAGW to tell us that this is a purely pork-barrel project designed only to increase the political capital of its sponsor? Bill Silliker Jr. Past president Friends of Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge Ocean Park

Full text: BRUNSWICK -- Several clam diggers suffered minor injuries Monday when more than 60 people rushed the doors of town hall to get 37 commercial shellfish licenses.
Two diggers were treated at Mid Coast Hospital and released, a hospital spokeswoman said.
Diggers said that the fastest runners -- many of them reportedly teen-agers -- were able to beat older diggers to the door.
In the rush, several people were knocked down, and one man broke his finger but first bought his license before going to the hospital.
Some harvesters said that not getting a license will force them to dig illegally, constantly watching for the warden, in order to feed themselves and their families. Some charged that the town unfairly issued licenses to nonresidents and to part-time diggers.
"I'm not going to be able to hold my head high much longer," said Stephen Fortin, who poached last year and plans to poach this year as well. "This is ridiculous," he said. "How does a 45-year-old man compete against a 17- or 18-year-old kid that just wants a summer job?"
Marine Resources Warden Alan J. Houston said officials followed the town's rules Monday and probably would discuss changes to them to prevent a similiar incident.
"The town ordinance here says first come, first serve. The line forms at 6:45 a.m.," said Houston.
The only criterion in getting a license was being a Brunswick resident and being one of the first 37 people in line. People had been in the town hall parking lot since Saturday. Some arrived between 2 and 4 a.m. Monday.
Houston said that the town leaves the actual forming of the line to the harvesters, who have their own "code" or system of rules about how to line up. "Certainly the marine resources committee and other town officials can't go out there and hold everybody else's hand," said Houston.
But that code apparently broke down. "In essence, the harvesters were fighting among themselves," said Houston.

Fighting for aquaculture

Abstract: The Maine Chamber of Commerce and the Maine Alliance recently held a summit on economic growth strategy. Their report emphasized research and development, highlighting a handful of enterprises -- aquaculture prominent among them. Maine must target cutting-edge industries or lose jobs. Ironically, research dollars for aquaculture dropped 36 percent in the 1990s. Maine is doing exactly the opposite of what economists -- and common sense -- suggest. Maine cannot survive on service industries and summer jobs alone. Norway, New Brunswick, and Ireland are aggressively seeking aquaculture jobs. Maine's timidity will only expand the welfare rolls. A Finance Authority of Maine report said, "The market and price potentials of aquaculture products appear extremely encouraging. Aquaculture provides an opportunity to respond to consumer demand for high-quality seafood on a consistent basis. ... Yet the lack of investment in aquaculture has been prohibitive to growth." The federal government is now restricting the groundfish catch (cod, haddock, flounder). The Canadians are already moving toward groundfish aquaculture. Groundfish aquaculture will work as well on the coast of southern Maine as it will Down East! Unless Maine aggressively researches and develops groundfish aquaculture, Maine jobs will be lost.

Full text: Jobs. Jobs. Jobs. All politicicans talk about creating jobs. Rhetoric must become reality. Together with Sen. Harry Vose, the Maine Chamber of Commerce and others, we have offered legislation to help put Mainers to work: An Act to Encourage Economic Development Through Increased Investment in Aquaculture. Aquaculture (sometimes called fish farming) is the controlled harvesting of sea life (e.g. Atlantic salmon, steelhead, sheelfish, and seaweed).
Aquaculture means jobs. Aquaculture requires hatcheries (some in western Maine). A strong aquaculture industry will need suppliers of feed and equipment in state. Financial centers in Bangor and Portland will benefit. And, of course, we will create desperately needed jobs Down East. This legislation is a jobs program for all Mainers.
We must help the industry expand its physical infrastructure and its research and development base. First, a $5 million bond issue would go before the voters to create a revolving fund for low-interest aquaculture loans. The fund, modeled upon the successful $5 million Potato Marketing Improvement Fund, will promote the piers, fishpens, nets, and work platforms necessary to this high-tech industry. The Finance Authority of Maine would administer the fund.
Second, research money for the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center would be restored to its previous peak budget of $302,000 (an increase of $113,000). The Bangor Daily News noted recently that the Norwegians are spending around $5 million a year on halibut research alone. They've pushed their salmon production from 120,000 tons in 1992 to 180,000 in 1993. (Maine produces 7,000 tons annually.)
The Maine Chamber of Commerce and the Maine Alliance recently held a summit on economic growth strategy. Their report emphasized research and development, highlighting a handful of enterprises -- aquaculture prominent among them. Maine must target cutting-edge industries or lose jobs. Ironically, research dollars for aquaculture dropped 36 percent in the 1990s. Maine is doing exactly the opposite of what economists -- and common sense -- suggest. Maine cannot survive on service industries and summer jobs alone.
Norway, New Brunswick, and Ireland are aggressively seeking aquaculture jobs. Maine's timidity will only expand the welfare rolls. A Finance Authority of Maine report said, "The market and price potentials of aquaculture products appear extremely encouraging. Aquaculture provides an opportunity to respond to consumer demand for high-quality seafood on a consistent basis. ... Yet the lack of investment in aquaculture has been prohibitive to growth."
Maine has a natural edge. University of Maine economist Jim Wilson says Maine's cool, nutrient-rich waters are the best natural environment for salmon and steelhead aquaculture in the contiguous states. Our waters are also excellent for shellfish and seaweed aquaculture. We have great potential in the halibut market.
The federal government is now restricting the groundfish catch (cod, haddock, flounder). The Canadians are already moving toward groundfish aquaculture. Groundfish aquaculture will work as well on the coast of southern Maine as it will Down East! Unless Maine aggressively researches and develops groundfish aquaculture, Maine jobs will be lost.
Aquaculture is a market worth fighting for. The non-partisan federal Office of Technology Assessment states, "Consumer demand exceeds production of catch-fisheries. The proportion of aquatic organisms raised by aquaculture is expected to climb from 11 to 25 percent of the global harvest by the year 2000." There are billions of dollars and thousands of jobs waiting for Maine in 21st century aquaculture. Do we sit on our hands and let the Norwegians, Irish and Canadians bump us out of our natural market? Or do we fight for Maine people and Maine jobs?
In 1990 the State Planning Office recommended research and development funding for the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center. The state's Science and Technology Plan (October 1992) said the same thing. The Finance Authority of Maine recommended a revolving loan fund that would help aquaculture. The Maine Alliance and the Maine Chamber of Commerce this month targeted aquaculture as part of their economic development strategy. The experts are unanimous. Clean, sustainable jobs are there for the taking.
The only question is, do we want to help create jobs or do we just want to talk about jobs? The time to act is now. The 21st century is coming whether Maine is ready or not.
This aquaculture plan can dovetail with a group of economic development proposals. The Economic Development Committee has some excellent ideas. However, the committee's proposals, with bond issues similar to what is proposed here, do not allocate money for any specific industry. Each industry must start at square one to secure financing despite the fact that certain industries have been strategically targeted by the experts.
To improve on the Economic Development Committee's excellent proposal -- both sustantively and in terms of political viability -- a bond issue could be targeted at $5 million for each high-potential industry. Thus value-added forest products enthusiasts would favor the referendum for their part and aquaculture the same. Overall the people of Maine would benefit from a plan that specifically targets the industries that have greatest potential for future growth -- aquaculture chief among them.
The thrust of our aquaculture proposal can mesh with the Economic Development Committee's proposal. Without that change the overall proposal may be less viable on the ballot and less useful to our long-term growth. If our economic development plans are not aggressively targeted at high-potential industries like aquaculture, our efforts will be less successful. We cannot afford to miss this opportunity.

Full text: Yesterday would have been the first day of spring, if we had spring in Maine.
In places where they do have spring, you can smell it. Warmth radiates from the earth with a rich, heady aroma. The wind stops, the sun beats down, and a 60-degree day seems warmer than any 80-degree day people can remember -- a day that demands shorts. Greenery erupts.
People who live in places that have spring celebrate the season in traditional ways -- they throw Frisbees and make goo-goo eyes in public and barbecue in unusual hats.
Here in Maine it is different. The Earth tilts, the days get longer, and we know we're halfway through winter. It's better, but it's not spring.
On a fluky gorgeous day like Monday, the brown-gray ice pack recedes far enough to reveal things we have forgotton about. In Bangor, an abandoned mattress on the Griffin Road reappeared, as did an old shoe on Lincoln Street and the long-lost right lane of Main Street.
A group of high school-age boys found enough blacktop on one driveway to play basketball. They even wore shorts, a singular act of denial. But with snowpiles in place of sidelines, the illusion was thin.
Still, the day after the vernal equinox is worth some sort of notice, and Mainers celebrated it in their own quirky way:
Several people were injured in the town of Brunswick's running of the clam diggers. In this annual event, clam diggers line up to apply for a limited number of commercial shellfish licenses -- 37 this year.
The way the town fathers imagined it, the would-be diggers would negotiate among themselves who was most deserving of the licenses and who was the neediest.
Instead, people began lining up on Saturday. When the doors opened, the diggers behind the first 37 decided that a footrace would be the most equitable way of selecting the licensees, and chaos broke out.
On the bright side, the licensing process makes raking clams look easy by comparison.
Augusta took the day off.
This, of course, is not a phenomenon limited to any particular season. But it does seem like the government's three-day weekends are coming more frequently these days, especially when there is a break in the weather.
These breaks have been inaccurately called "state shutdown days." The state, however, does not shut down -- just the State House, the bureaucracies sprawled all over Augusta and their satellite offices.
The rest of the state goes about its business with no apparent disruption, leading one to wonder: How did we ever settle on a five-day-a-week government anyway? And if a big state like California can do its weekly business in five days, shouldn't a small state like Maine be able to polish off its work in one or two days?
Farther north, experts tried to figure out how bad the flooding might be later in the presummer season.
Probably they know better than to think flooding can be predicted. But they also know that if a river does flood, as rivers tend to do, the people who get wet will demand to know why they were not warned.
So flood experts examine snow depth, water content, ice thickness, long-term forecasts and tea leaves.
Their conclusion? If it rains a lot, some rivers could flood. Don't say you weren't warned.
These are not signs of spring so much as symptoms of advanced cabin fever, and they are evident everywhere.
At the coffee shop that supplies most of my caffeine, the proprietors have taken to throwing a small rubber ball over the counter and across the room toward a small, empty fishbowl that sits in the middle of the floor. They have been doing this since January.
One has gotten the ball in the bowl 27 times. The other has made it about 15 times. Between them, they have taken several thousand shots.
On Monday, there was talk of warm weather and new activities and how the makeshift game would come to an end when spring arrived. But nobody rushed to pick up the fishbowl -- plenty of time for that later.
In the meantime, first one to 50 wins.

Abstract: As for salmon in the Pacific Northwest, and three main commercial species in New England, the decline is catastrophic -- threatening to wipe out not just whole industries, but cultures and communities that are fused to the cycles of tide and sea currents. Fishing communities in Massachusetts are in such bad shape that Gov. William F. Weld last week requested emergency financial aid from the federal government. Thousands of fishermen are in "immediate danger" of losing their homes and boats this spring, Weld said. The trawler owners blame small boat operators who do not follow the rules, fishing out of season or using illegal nets. Environmentalists blame, among others, industries that have drained wetlands and dumped toxins into shallow bays.

Full text: SEATTLE -- For the volunteers who count fish returning from the sea to fresh water, this has been the loneliest year ever.
The surging Pacific salmon and steelhead are gone; what the fish counters at the Puget Sound ship locks see when they stare at the glass wall separating them from the water is nothing but a reflection of their own faces.
Across the country, in Gloucester and New Bedford, Mass., the story is the same. After 350 years, the oldest American fishing area is largely barren of the great swarms of haddock, cod and flounder that sustained more than 10 generations of New Englanders and became millions of fish sticks.
The Atlantic fishermen have asked that the government treat them like earthquake disaster victims. Last week, they honked their boat horns in Boston Harbor to draw attention to their plight. To some, it was a funeral dirge.
From Chesapeake Bay, where oystermen are fading like fog in the afternoon sun, to the Gulf of Mexico, where grouper and red snapper are mostly a memory, people who pull fish from the sea for a living are singing the same sad song.
Government officials say most of the major commercial fishing areas in this country outside Alaska are in trouble, and worldwide, 13 of the 17 principal fishing zones are depleted or in steep decline.
As for salmon in the Pacific Northwest, and three main commercial species in New England, the decline is catastrophic -- threatening to wipe out not just whole industries, but cultures and communities that are fused to the cycles of tide and sea currents.
For the first time, there may be no ocean salmon fishing on the West Coast this year, a situation roughly akin to Georgia not producing any peaches.
Fishing communities in Massachusetts are in such bad shape that Gov. William F. Weld last week requested emergency financial aid from the federal government. Thousands of fishermen are in "immediate danger" of losing their homes and boats this spring, Weld said.
Aside from devotees of wild fish, however, consumers may not notice a shortage of fish at the supermarket. In recent years, farm fish raised in pens in Norway or South America have flooded the market, driving down the price of fish.
In some cases, the lowered prices have led fishermen to harvest more ocean fish in compensation. About 40 percent of the nation's important saltwater species have been overfished, meaning more fish have been taken than there are young fish to replace them, according to a recent report by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
Who is exactly at fault in the decline is much debated. Old-time fishermen blame factory trawlers -- boats the size of football fields that use sonar and satellite communications to track huge schools of fish in remote areas.
The trawler owners blame small boat operators who do not follow the rules, fishing out of season or using illegal nets. Environmentalists blame, among others, industries that have drained wetlands and dumped toxins into shallow bays.
Experts seem to agree on a few points. Pollution has indeed played a role: Pacific salmon have disappeared because the freshwater streams where they spawn have been soiled or are blocked by dams. Restoring the streams may cost in excess of $2 billion in the Northwest.
But, the experts say, fishermen themselves are also to blame for taking more than the sea could give back in New England, the mid-Atlantic and the Gulf.
"You can boil it all down to the fact that there are far too many fishermen and not enough fish," said Dick Schaefer, the conservation director of the national fisheries service.

Pollution testing plan gets broad support Sen. Cianchette raises funding question

Abstract: [James Reed Coles], D-Harpswell, told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee his proposed program in its first year alone would require nearly the $570,000 that has been spent on Maine's testing programs so far. Maine's monitoring program could cost $670,000 a year after that, said Coles, who handed committee members sheets listing several ideas on how to raise the money. DEP Commissioner Dean C. Marriott, who supports the bill, cited studies showing that mercury levels in Maine's eagles are among the highest in the nation. Also, he said, fish in the Androscoggin River have among the nation's highest dioxin levels, and there is "significant" contamination of bluefish by cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.

Full text: AUGUSTA -- Lawmakers found plenty of vocal support Wednesday for a proposal to monitor Maine waters for toxic pollution, but there were few concrete suggestions on how to finance it.
Rep. James Reed Coles' bill would create an ongoing program to test all of the state's waters to find out where pollution is the most serious.
The program would replace a patchwork of smaller programs that have been conducted in scattered locations around the state. Most of the tests have been financed by the federal government, and that money is gradually running out, according to the state Department of Environmental Pro- tection.
Coles, D-Harpswell, told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee his proposed program in its first year alone would require nearly the $570,000 that has been spent on Maine's testing programs so far.
Maine's monitoring program could cost $670,000 a year after that, said Coles, who handed committee members sheets listing several ideas on how to raise the money.
DEP Commissioner Dean C. Marriott, who supports the bill, cited studies showing that mercury levels in Maine's eagles are among the highest in the nation. Also, he said, fish in the Androscoggin River have among the nation's highest dioxin levels, and there is "significant" contamination of bluefish by cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
Only 3 percent of the total miles of Maine's rivers and less than 1 percent of its estuaries have been tested for toxic pollution, according to the Natural Resources Council of Maine.
Several fishermen and fishing industry representatives said they were concerned about pollution that could threaten the resource on which they depend for a living.
"We can't sell our products if we don't have clean water," said Gene Graffam, a shellfish harvester from Harpswell.
As a string of witnesses sounded similar concerns, Sen. Alton "Chuck" Cianchette interrupted the proceeding to tell the crowded audience, "We're already convinced. ... Please give us credit for getting the message."
The Newport Democrat said he and probably all of the committee members agreed there is a need for a monitoring program.
"We need to know how to fund it," he said.
Maine's paper makers believe the cost should be borne by all taxpayers through the state's General Fund, said Floyd Rutherford, president of the Paper Industry Information Office, who also spoke in support of the bill.
Rutherford said any monitoring should be objective and subject to federal standards to make sure the findings are kept in perspective. He also said health-risk assessments should be held to strict scientific standards.
The Natural Resources Council's Peter Washburn said in prepared testimony that there "is no perfect mechanism" for financing the program, and that finding a way to pay for it will require difficult choices.

Justice Andrew Mead heard the following cases in Waldo County Superior Court on Friday.
Ryan M. Boivin, 21, of Unity was sentenced to concurrent three-year jail sentences with all but nine months and one day suspended, plus two years of probation, after pleading guilty to charges stemming from three burglaries in his home town. Boivin received concurrent 60-day jail sentences after pleading guilty to criminal mischief and two counts of theft. He also was ordered to make restitution of $1,000 to his victims.
Boivin was accused of the July 17, 1992, break at the Beverage Mill in Unity, during which beer and cigarettes valued at less than $500 were taken; the Sept. 1, 1992, break at Unity Race Track during which less than $500 in currency was taken; the July 27, 1993, break at the Unity Laundromat during which beverage and vacuum machines were damaged; the destruction of a Unity Telephone Co. telephone booth valued at more than $1,000; and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
Troy C. Oliver, 20, of Monroe was fined $500 after pleading nolo contendere to a charge of terrorizing. Charges of driving to endanger, failure to report an accident and leaving the scene of an accident were dismissed. The charges stemmed from an incident in Monroe last May 19 during which Oliver was accused of terrorizing and shouting racial epithets at the driver of an automobile with which his vehicle had collided.

Full text: BROOKLIN -- There is more than a tad of a twinkle in the eye of boat builder Arno Day as he describes the method of handling clients he developed in more than 50 years in the business.
In addition to the role of historian-philosopher that is part of Day's status as both a local and industry legend, he has also had to play salesman and psychologist.
For best results, he would humor his customers, politely listening to their suggestions while continuing to fashion their crafts as he saw fit.
Along the way, he would drop hints and suggestions, until the buyers became convinced they had come up with the grand designs themselves.
Day says lobstermen were a contentious lot, joking that he hated stormy mid-winter days in his shop, when lobstermen would hang around, and an argument was sure to ensue.
No two fishermen wanted the exact same boat, Day says. They would argue with each other and with him over details.
Just once in Day's career, a fisherman put his faith wholly in the boatbuilder's hands, in effect saying, "Build it the way you want, and I'll fish it," Day says,
Day discussed his work at a recent lecture in Bayview Hall, where a large crowd gathered to hear his version of the history of lobster boats.
"It takes a lot of patience, and you try to take instructions," he said of his work. "But there was no better group of people to work for than lobstermen. They appreciated everything you did, and they knew they were getting their money's worth."
No one knows when a boat was first used to snare a lobster, and that crustacean's capture was probably an accident. But Day likes to speculate on the beginnings of the tradition.
According to the fourth-generation boatbuilder now in his 70s, historians know that America's early settlers gathered seaweed for their gardens, probably picking up lobsters incidentally.
In Day's surmises, the first would-be lobsterman was a native American, who, having harvested all the seaweed on his home shore, set out by boat for greener pastures, inadvertently harvesting lobsters along the way.
At that time, you could practically reach down and be bitten by a lobster, they were so plentiful, Day said.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, a great flurry of boatbuilding on the Maine coast and elsewhere produced vessels capable of wartime and other uses. Somewhere along the line, people who recognized the culinary virtues of lobster, had access to boats to search out the shellfish in earnest.
Around 1915, the lobster boat as we know it was originated in the Jonesport-Beals area by a Nova Scotian.
The first lobster boats were longer and narrower than what we think of now, and have always incorporated the displacement principle of propulsion. Instead of just skimming over the top of the water, they part it.
To illustrate the principle of displacement, Day suggested trying to retrieve a slippery bar of soap dropped in a bathtub. When it shoots from your hands, that's displacement, Day said.
The shape of lobster boats has changed little since their inception, but they have grown wider to maximize comfort, stability and storage capacity.
Day shakes his head confoundedly at the "speed craze" he says some lobstermen are caught up in. "Lobster boats have been designed to win the race on the Fourth of July, so in some respects, they aren't ideal working boats," he says.

Abstract: Water pollution projects are languishing from inadequate funding in Maine, while local sewer rates are soaring, according to a report released Monday by an environmental group. It said 35 percent of the shellfish beds along the coast have been closed because of waste water contamination or lack of resources to certify them as safe. Also, beaches in the Portland area are routinely closed because of pollution, [Doug Bogen] said. Inland fish consumption advisories have been issued on 236 miles, or 22.5 percent, of Maine's largest rivers because of dioxin contamination. And 21 percent of Maine's lake acreage is not swimmable or fishable, it said.

Full text: PORTLAND -- Water pollution projects are languishing from inadequate funding in Maine, while local sewer rates are soaring, according to a report released Monday by an environmental group.
Clean Water Action and several other organizations that endorsed the report came out in support of federal legislation that would place more of the cost of cleaning polluted water on polluters instead of property taxpayers.
"People are fed up with paying ever-increasing sewer and water rates while beaches and waterways continue to be polluted," said Doug Bogen of Clean Water Action.
"It's time to identify new clean-water funding sources that don't put all the burden squarely on the backs of taxpayers," he said.
The report says water pollution is a problem along the coast and inland.
It said 35 percent of the shellfish beds along the coast have been closed because of waste water contamination or lack of resources to certify them as safe. Also, beaches in the Portland area are routinely closed because of pollution, Bogen said.
Inland fish consumption advisories have been issued on 236 miles, or 22.5 percent, of Maine's largest rivers because of dioxin contamination. And 21 percent of Maine's lake acreage is not swimmable or fishable, it said.
The report outlined several threats to Maine water, including raw sewage releases and industrial discharges.
The state's paper industry is the single greatest contributor to toxic waste in Maine's rivers, the report said.
"What we're proposing will serve notice to the paper industry that if they continue to use our rivers as a waste disposal (site), they're going to have to pay a price, literally," said Bogen.
The report said it will cost more than $1 billion to finance projects to meet current clean-water standards over the next two decades. The state has been receiving about $26 million per year in federal loan guarantees for the projects.
As a result, the report said, residential sewer rates have risen an average of 85 percent over the past five years in Maine's seven largest cities.
The group urged support for federal legislation that would put fees on toxic waste generators, producers of agricultural chemicals and commercial water users.
Rep. Tom Andrews, D-Maine, is a co-sponsor of the legislation.
"Access to clean water is a basic right that all Americans should share," Andrews said in a statement. "Unfortunately, what too many Americans do share are skyrocketing water and sewer bills to secure that right, because those who pollute our waters are not required to clean up their own mess."

Bill designed to aid aquaculture

Full text: A Bangor representative has introduced a bill in the Maine Legislature that would promote economic development through investment in Maine's aquaculture industry.
Democrat Sean Faircloth's bill would result in a $5 million bond issue being placed before Maine voters. The money would be used to set up a revolving loan fund to be administered by the Finance Authority of Maine. New and expanding aquaculture businesses would be able to borrow money from the fund at reasonable interest rates.
The companies would likely finance their growth by combining the FAME loans with loans from private lenders.
The bill also would restore state support for applied research on aquaculture to $310,000, or the level where it stood in 1990. During the last four years, state support for aquaculture research has declined by 36 percent.
According to Faircloth, Maine aquaculture is the fastest growing segment of the state's food production industry. Businesses in the industry produce almost $50 million worth of mussels, Atlantic salmon, oysters, steelhead trout and clams at farmsites all along the coast.
"Maine's 30 aquaculture enterprises employ nearly 500 persons statewide at inland hatcheries, coastal grow-out sites, and seafood processing facilities," Faircloth said. "This industry is a natural for Maine."

Aquaculture in Maine

Publication info: Bangor Daily News ; Bangor, Me. [Bangor, Me]15 Feb 1994.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/413742939?accountid=10457

Abstract: Speculators on the future of aquaculture in Maine might consider the following: seafood will continue to be an important part of the world's diet; the food supply from the sea is far from inexhaustible; and the fishing industry must continue to move beyond open-sea techniques to provide the world with inexpensive food. Maine can take a crucial role in shaping the future of this industry. Aside from small shellfish operations, the difficulty of expanding Maine's aquaculture industry is in its startup costs. A finfish business can cost several million dollars to begin, and banks are understandably tentative about loaning large sums to this relatively new enterprise. If the state is to target enterprises that show promise, as economists are always urging Maine to do, however, aquaculture is a likely candidate for encouragement.

Full text: Speculators on the future of aquaculture in Maine might consider the following: seafood will continue to be an important part of the world's diet; the food supply from the sea is far from inexhaustible; and the fishing industry must continue to move beyond open-sea techniques to provide the world with inexpensive food. Maine can take a crucial role in shaping the future of this industry.
Competition in this industry will come not only from other countries, but nationally. Chile, Norway and Canada already have developing aquaculture industries, but so do Washington state, Alaska and several Eastern Seaboard states. If Maine is to succeed in this worldwide industry, it must be aggressive in its research, development and marketing.
Maine's relatively clean waters and good summer and winter water temperatures make it ideal for farming certain types of fish and mollusks. Cobscook Bay is especially conducive to sea farming. The state's $45 million industry, about one-third of the total amount of aquaculture in the Northeast, accounts for 450 full-time jobs at 20 finfish farms, eight shellfish farms and one farm growing nori, a seaweed favored in sushi and other Japanese foods.
Aside from small shellfish operations, the difficulty of expanding Maine's aquaculture industry is in its startup costs. A finfish business can cost several million dollars to begin, and banks are understandably tentative about loaning large sums to this relatively new enterprise. If the state is to target enterprises that show promise, as economists are always urging Maine to do, however, aquaculture is a likely candidate for encouragement.
The Maine Legislature will consider a bill this session that would spur investment in the aquaculture industry. LD 1759, sponsored by Sean Faircloth, D-Bangor, would put before the voters a $5 million bond issue to provide low-interest loans for capital investment to encourage more Mainers to become involved in the industry. It would also return the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center in Brewer to its previous funding levels.
Lester Brown, president of the environmental-research group Worldwatch Institute, recently pointed out that the growth of the fish catch peaked in 1989, after multiplying four-fold since 1950. All 17 of world's major fishing areas have either reached or exceeded their natural limits, he said, and nine of those are in decline. Declining stocks for Maine fishermen threaten to destroy a traditional industry in the state. Aquaculture is one way to counteract this heavy demand on the sea.
It is also a way, over the long-term, to lower prices for seafood to allow it to compete with beef, poultry and pork. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently reported that aquaculture's gains have come largely at the cost of non-farm seafood. "It will take a great deal of work," USDA economist, David J. Harvey, said recently, "developing new production and processing techniques before the aquaculture industry can compete on a direct price basis with the poultry industry."
The Aquaculture Innovation Center supports such research, which will enable fish farmers to expand their businesses and their markets. The center's budget, however, has been reduced during the recent difficult budget times, from a high of $308,000 to its current $190,000. Most of that money is disbursed in grants from several hundred dollars to $12,000 to $20,000 for research at such places as the University of Maine. Often, this state money is used to leverage federal dollars.
Like the Potato Marketing Improvement Fund, which helped retain jobs in Maine, the $5 million aquaculture loan fund is an investment in local industry and in the state's natural resources. Developed correctly, aquaculture could become a significant player in Maine's changing economy.

Abstract: What is it about Sears Island that makes these two agencies so concerned? In the early '80s, the Department of Marine Resources did research trawling in the vicinity of Sears Island. Results? As National Fisherman Magazine reported, the DMR discovered "a gigantic fish nursery." The DMR scientists found that these waters abounded with larval and juvenile cod, haddock, flounder, shrimp, halibut, pollock, smelt, alewives and about thirty other fish species. As we all know, populations of many of these species are at an all-time low. Destroying critical habitat for the young of these fish will condemn Maine's commercial fishing industry to a continued loss of their livelihood. That's why these agencies are so strongly against this project. The National Marine Fisheries Service also rejects MDOT's bizarre new plan to build the port on pilings above the shallows as still too damaging to the fisheries to accept. This will be good for the Japanese and Korean economies, but what about Maine? Like other states where woodchips are exported, Maine will quickly be stripped of the hardwood forests that attract so many tourists for the "leafpeeper" season. That provide vital raw maerials for furniture makers, wooden boat builders, even pallet makers. Chip mills buy hardwoods by the acres, taking all species at all ages, at a slightly better price than furniture and pallet makers can afford. The lure of quick money for "junk" owners as well as large companies like Champion, which recently opened a large woodchip export operation in North Carolina. The plan for Sears Island would require liquidating about 62,000 acres of hardwoods each year, wrecking Maine's tourism and furniture business while it dooms Maine's commercial fishery.

Full text: The tempest over whether or not to build a cargo port on Sears Island has been portrayed by the Bangor Daily News as a conflict between elitist special interests and reasonable people trying to balance care for the environment with economic growth. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The battle is really between those who want to protect Maine's tourism and commercial fishing industry and those who want to strip Maine of its hardwood forests, for a quick inernational buck, regardless of the ecological consequences. Between Maine's finished wood products industry and raw material exporters linked to Korean and Japanese paper companies. Between hard science and robber baron economics.
Mainers should thank the Sierra Club and other advocates for the environment for two compelling reasons:
Maine's commercial fisheries. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, construction of the port on Sears Island will have a very negative effect on the commercial fisheries of Maine. Contrary to the BDN's recent editorial, destruction of eelgrass meadows, clamflats and other shallows in the area of the proposed port has not been completed. That's why these two agencies recently had this to say.
National Marine Fisheries Service: "The values of the eelgrass meadows, shellfish beds and shallow subtidal flats as foraging, shelter and nursery areas for marine species have been documented in great detail over the past two years. In our judgment, the marine impacts of the Sears Island cargo port project alone justify a finding that the project would cause significant degradation and is thus ineligible for a (Clean Water Act) Section 404 permit."
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: "The potential adverse impacts to fish and wildlife resources are extremely serious. After 12 years of studying the environmental impacts associated with this project, we believe the time has come to be forthright with the Maine Department of Transportation and advise them that those impacts are unacceptable and violate the Clean Water Act Section 404 guidelines."
That's why these agencies are advising the Army Corps of Engineers to deny permission to dredge.
What is it about Sears Island that makes these two agencies so concerned? In the early '80s, the Department of Marine Resources did research trawling in the vicinity of Sears Island. Results? As National Fisherman Magazine reported, the DMR discovered "a gigantic fish nursery." The DMR scientists found that these waters abounded with larval and juvenile cod, haddock, flounder, shrimp, halibut, pollock, smelt, alewives and about thirty other fish species. As we all know, populations of many of these species are at an all-time low. Destroying critical habitat for the young of these fish will condemn Maine's commercial fishing industry to a continued loss of their livelihood. That's why these agencies are so strongly against this project. The National Marine Fisheries Service also rejects MDOT's bizarre new plan to build the port on pilings above the shallows as still too damaging to the fisheries to accept.
Tourism and woodworking industries. The real reason the McKernan administration insists that the facility be built on Sears Island instead of expanding Mack Point is that its primary use will be to export up to 600,000 tons of hardwood chips a year year to fine paper industries overseas. Japanese and Korean paper mills will not buy woodchips if they are contaminated with coal dust, as could happen if the mountains of woodchips that would exit Maine were alongside piles of coal at Mack Point.
This will be good for the Japanese and Korean economies, but what about Maine? Like other states where woodchips are exported, Maine will quickly be stripped of the hardwood forests that attract so many tourists for the "leafpeeper" season. That provide vital raw maerials for furniture makers, wooden boat builders, even pallet makers. Chip mills buy hardwoods by the acres, taking all species at all ages, at a slightly better price than furniture and pallet makers can afford. The lure of quick money for "junk" owners as well as large companies like Champion, which recently opened a large woodchip export operation in North Carolina. The plan for Sears Island would require liquidating about 62,000 acres of hardwoods each year, wrecking Maine's tourism and furniture business while it dooms Maine's commercial fishery.
What benefits will Mainers get out of this new port? In return for putting thousands of Mainers in the fishing, tourism and woodworking industries out of work, about eight jobs. Yes, eight! Woodchip mills employ eight workers on average to grind about 85 truckloads of logs a day.
Of course, a few dozen temporary jobs will he created to dredge out the eelgrass meadows and clamflats and construct the port, and the transportation industry will enjoy a decade of prosperity hauling hardwoods to Sears Island. But then, once the hardwoods are gone, those eight workers will join the thousands of unemployed fishermen, furniture makers and members of the tourism industry whose jobs they destroyed on the unemployment line. The trucks will be sporting "For sale" signs, and the Japanese and Koreans will be counting their money and moving on to other areas. All other imports and exports through the port will be the result of diverting cargo from the Eastport and Portland ports, taking e jobs along with them.
While this may be a "shrewd move," as your editorial puts it, it is also a cruel shell game, pitting regional economies against each other.
The Bangor Daily News may choose to call the Sears Island port' "the end of an economic funnel," but it could more accurately l be called "the end of an economic recovery." How can anyone promote such a shortsighted and destructive project?
Ron Huber is director of the Coastal Waters Project, a grass-roots network dedicated to protecting marine and estuarine habitat along the Atlantic coast of the United States.

Full text: CASTINE -- A series of five public lectures on marine topics ranging from water quality monitoring to marine snow will be offered at Maine Maritime Academy in the coming weeks.
The lectures are part of an annual series presented by the Academy's Corning School of Ocean Studies. The events will be held in the afternoon and are free of charge.
Professor Tom Shattuck of Colby College will present "Marine Aerosol Chemistry" at 4 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 15, in the Alumni Lecture Hall. Shattuck said his work involves study of air masses over coastal areas, and because he studies particle masses, he sometimes subtitles his lecture with the pun, "What in particular are you breathing now?"
Shattuck hopes to have data from air sampling conducted off the Maine coast last summer available in time for the talk.
Marine biologist Paul Anderson of the Maine Department of Marine Resources will speak on "The Role of DMR in Monitoring Coastal Waters" at 3 p.m. Monday, Feb. 28, in the Alumni Lecture Hall. Based at the DMR laboratory in Lamoine, Anderson has been involved in several reopenings of shellfish harvesting areas previously closed due to pollution.
Clam flat closings are generally attributable to either excessive fecal coliform concentrations or to the naturally occurring algae blooms characterizing red tide.
The DMR usually reopens closed shellfish areas after water quality testing indicates that bacterial concentrations are within acceptable limits. Among the closed areas the DMR has reopened recently are Crockett Cove on the coast of Stonington, and Webber and Curtis coves in the Blue Hill area.
The remaining lectures in the series will be presented by University of Maine faculty members.
"Circulation in the Gulf of Maine" will be presented by Professor Neil Pettigrew at 3 p.m. Monday, March 7, in the Alumni Lecture Hall.
Professor Malcolm Shick will speak on "Solar UV Radiation and Oxidative Stress in Marine Organisms: A Spectrum of Responses," at 4 p.m. Monday, March 28, in Payson Hall.
The final lecture will be "Marine Snow and the Carbon Cycle: Not Just a Lot of Fluff," by Professor Cindy Pilskaln at 4 p.m. Monday, April 11 in the Alumni Lecture Hall.
For more information on the series, call 326-2256.

Little harm expected to lobster industry

Abstract: Jim Markos, general manager at Maine Shellfish in Ellsworth, agreed with [Buddy Lynch]'s assessment. He expected that some people would be wary of lobster for a while, but he didn't expect to see a long-term decline in business. He didn't receive any calls to cancel wholesale orders after the warning was issued. State officials say that a woman of child-bearing age could eat three, 1 1/4-pound lobsters a month, along with the tomalley, "without adverse risk." Markos said consumption patterns of lobster would indicate that most people ate lobster less than three times a month.

Full text: Seafood dealers expect little long-term harm to the lobster industry in the wake of the state's warning that the crustacean's tomalley contains trace amounts of dioxin.
The most convincing support for this prediction comes from Massachusetts, where a similar warning was issued in 1988.
Buddy Lynch, who manages Hook & Co. Lobster in Boston, said there was a short-term decrease in demand, but the industry rebounded quickly. He expects the same thing will happen in Maine.
"Two years from now, no one will even remember," Lynch said.
Jim Markos, general manager at Maine Shellfish in Ellsworth, agreed with Lynch's assessment. He expected that some people would be wary of lobster for a while, but he didn't expect to see a long-term decline in business. He didn't receive any calls to cancel wholesale orders after the warning was issued.
State officials say that a woman of child-bearing age could eat three, 1 1/4-pound lobsters a month, along with the tomalley, "without adverse risk." Markos said consumption patterns of lobster would indicate that most people ate lobster less than three times a month.
Another indication that the impact of the warning might decline with time is that there will be no on-going warnings issued. According to Hal Winters of the Bureau of Marine Development at the Department of Marine Resources, there won't be warning labels, signs or other notices required to constantly remind consumers of the dioxin.
"There probably won't be other action taken because of the limits of this particular advisory," Winters said.
The impact of the advisory may be magnified temporarily because it's winter and lobster sales are at a low point. Any decline will show up in sales. There are also a lot of Canadian lobsters flooding the U.S. market now.
In fact, Lynch said he had only Canadian lobsters in his tanks this week. "I've thought of putting up a sign ,`I sell only Canadian lobsters,' " he said. But he doubted that he would.
There have been no dioxin warnings issued on Canadian lobsters, according to Dave Aiken and Vlado Zitko of Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans in Saint Andrews, New Brunswick.
Zitko said the lobsters had been tested, but no warnings were necessary. He didn't have the results of the tests.
"It's a politically sensitive area, and tests can be done and not get wide distribution," Aiken said.

Eating dioxin

Abstract: The last is necessary not to confirm that even minute quantities of dioxin are harmful to humans, but to give opponents in the debate a common set of numbers. Evidence continues to accumulate that exposure to dioxin leads to increased instances of leukemia, lymphoma and cancer, and that it can cause reproductive and developmental problems. But what level of dioxin, however small, leads to what level of increased risk of these diseases? A possible shortcoming in the lobster study, in fact, was its lack of funds. Paid for by paper companies through the dioxin monitoring program, the study did not test all of its lobsters separately at each of four sites because of the cost of dioxin analysis -- $1,150 a test. Instead, it divided each site's lobsters into groups of five, separated the tomalley from the lobster flesh and tested a ground up composite of each sub group's tomalley and flesh. A more accurate, though more expensive, result could have been found by teating each of the 40 lobsters individually.

Full text: Three things become clear after the state's report on unacceptably high levels of dioxin in lobsters at various locations along the coast: Maine must take steps to reduce the level of the toxin in its environment; the state needs a far more extensive survey of the effects of pollution on its rivers, lakes and coastal waters; and the Environmental Protection Agency must step forward with its long-promised report on dioxin.
The last is necessary not to confirm that even minute quantities of dioxin are harmful to humans, but to give opponents in the debate a common set of numbers. Evidence continues to accumulate that exposure to dioxin leads to increased instances of leukemia, lymphoma and cancer, and that it can cause reproductive and developmental problems. But what level of dioxin, however small, leads to what level of increased risk of these diseases?
The EPA was to have produced a thorough study of dioxin by now, but has yet to finish its work. April currently is the expected time for a draft report to be issued for public comment. Though debate over acceptable risk levels will certainly continue after the release of the final report late this year, public policy has a better chance of proceeding once the report is issued.
In the lobster study, dioxin was found as part of the environmental background in the control group and at twice that level of the control group at two of the three experiment sites. Its conclusions were not encouraging. Nursing mothers, pregnant women and women of childbearing age should avoid eating lobster tomalley, which serves as a lobster's liver.
The results of this study will have a negative impact on the lobster industry, the tourist industry (though it remains to be seen how well informed summer visitors will be of the warning), and the paper industry, one source of dioxin. The key here is not to shoot the messenger, but to take steps to reduce the threat.
Dioxin can be found almost anywhere. It is a byproduct of incineration, wood and coal burning and industrial processes that use chlorine. Trace amounts are found in dairy products and meats as well as in fish and shellfish. Animals at the top of the food chain generally have the highest concentrations.
Like lead, ubiquitous in the environment from sources such as paint, gasoline and solder in cans, dioxin's removal is possible, source by source. Indeed, a paper industry trade magazine, Pulp & Paper International, saw the end of its contribution to the problem as inevitable. "Some market pulp producers who believe they can continue to bleach with chlorine in the future," it said, "may end up paying for their error" because of the growing demand for chlorine-free paper.
If the study on lobsters causes no other action, it should push the Legislature to consider a bill that would fund a five-year project to monitor Maine waters for toxic contamination. Currently, the state lacks a comprehensive view of the condition of its lakes, rivers and coastal waters. The lobster study demonstrates the potential danger in this ignorance.
The bill, LD 1446, would offer the state a valuable scientific basis for assessing risk and setting environmental priorities. At $550,000 a year, the bill is not cheap, but is a necessary cost of having allowed pollution to spread widely throughout the environment.
A possible shortcoming in the lobster study, in fact, was its lack of funds. Paid for by paper companies through the dioxin monitoring program, the study did not test all of its lobsters separately at each of four sites because of the cost of dioxin analysis -- $1,150 a test. Instead, it divided each site's lobsters into groups of five, separated the tomalley from the lobster flesh and tested a ground up composite of each sub group's tomalley and flesh. A more accurate, though more expensive, result could have been found by teating each of the 40 lobsters individually.
LD 1446 is due before the Legislature in two weeks. Legislators wondering whether the monitoring program is worth the cost should remember the lobster study and ask themselves about the costs incurred by all of Maine when pollution is left unchecked. The lobsters should serve as red warning flags.

Dioxin enters rivers as mill waste

Abstract: In Maine, dioxin and related compounds are created in tiny amounts by seven paper mills that use chlorine to bleach wood pulp. The chemicals pass through waste treatment systems and eventually are released into Maine rivers. From the rivers dioxin enters the food chain and accumulates in the fatty tissue of fish, birds, animals and humans. Long-lived animals at the top of the food chain generally have the greatest concentration of dioxin in their bodies. The chemical was discovered in Maine rivers 10 years ago, when the EPA began a nationwide study of dioxin contamination. Scientists were surprised to discover the compound in fish from the Androscoggin River.

Full text: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers dioxin to be one of the most dangerous man-made substances. It is a byproduct of industrial processes that use chlorine.
In Maine, dioxin and related compounds are created in tiny amounts by seven paper mills that use chlorine to bleach wood pulp. The chemicals pass through waste treatment systems and eventually are released into Maine rivers.
From the rivers dioxin enters the food chain and accumulates in the fatty tissue of fish, birds, animals and humans. Long-lived animals at the top of the food chain generally have the greatest concentration of dioxin in their bodies.
Dioxin causes a skin disorder called chloracne. It also has been linked to cancer, liver disease, reproductive and developmental problems, and damage to the immune and nervous systems.
Scientists for the paper industry and other manufacturers contend that the health risks of dioxin are overstated. Other researchers claim the chemical is more dangerous than originally feared.
To resolve the dispute, the EPA commissioned a comprehensive study of the health risks of dioxin. Release of the findings has been delayed repeatedly, but a draft report may be available in April.
The chemical was discovered in Maine rivers 10 years ago, when the EPA began a nationwide study of dioxin contamination. Scientists were surprised to discover the compound in fish from the Androscoggin River.
In 1985, Maine residents were warned to limit their consumption of fish from parts of the Androscoggin. The warning later was expanded to include parts of the Penobscot, Kennebec and Presumpscot rivers.
Meanwhile, the state's paper mills began to invest millions of dollars to change their bleaching processes. The concentration of dioxin found in fish from the four rivers declined steadily from 1989 through 1992.
Maine, however, has a very limited testing program for toxics. Until two years ago, the state tested only a few species of freshwater fish near paper mills for dioxin contamination.
Most states do only limited testing of toxics. David Bailey, senior attorney in the Washington office of the Environmental Defense Fund, said it can cost more than $1,000 to perform a single dioxin test, plus the cost of collecting the animal, preparing the sample and shipping it to the lab.
The possibility that dioxin is present in other types of seafood deserves further investigation, according to Dean C. Marriott, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
The DEP and the Natural Resources Council of Maine are pushing for an expanded testing program. The Legislature balked at the cost in 1993, but it will take up the issue again this month.
Other states are far ahead of Maine in testing for toxics. Dioxin was found 11 years ago in lobster, crabs, bluefish, striped bass, carp, catfish, goldfish and eels in New Jersey.
In 1989, British Columbia closed eight areas near paper mills to the taking of oysters, clams, crabs and shrimp.
Dioxin and other industrial pollutants have been found in seafood caught along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, in the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. In most of those areas, paper mills are not the source of the contamination.
Atlantic salmon and other anadromous fish, which spend only part of their lives in fresh water, once were thought to be relatively unaffected by dioxin. But National Fisherman, a trade magazine based in Rockland, reported four years ago that even sea-run salmon have begun to accumulate the chemical in their tissues.

Abstract: Green stuff indeed, snorted the lobster snobs. Don't they know tomalley is a delicacy? Green stuff indeed, chuckled the geographic snobs. Why do you think we give flatlanders bibs? "Preliminary analysis of data from tests conducted on lobsters taken off the coast of Maine indicate unacceptably high concentrations of dioxin in lobster tomalley," squawked an official advisory sent out Wednesday. This week, the governor goes to Washington and three of his henchpeople blurt out some bad news about lobster. (Mind you, these people work for a man who, in national publications, is pictured holding lobsters.) Maybe when the governor gets back he can say that what his people really meant is that if dioxin were found in lobster tomalley, that would not be so terribly bad, but more study should be done before anybody says anything rash. And then maybe he can schedule state shutdown days for the next time he leaves town.

Full text: It is a famous story by now, and has the additional virtue of being true:
Some 10 years ago, an Ellsworth police officer arrived at a local restaurant to quell a disturbance. Just inside the door, he encountered the two perpetrators, a 59-year-old woman from Ohio and a 61-year-old woman from California.
The women would not pay their bill. They had ordered Maine lobster, but when they cracked the critters open, the women found the meat covered with "green stuff."
The police officer explained that the green stuff was tomalley -- lobster liver -- and that all lobsters have it. The women still refused to pay.
Finally the officer advised the suspects that if they did not settle up, they would be issued a summons for theft. At that, the women paid for the lobster, but they never did eat the green stuff.
Oh, how Maine laughed at that one. Nothing better than a good tourist joke to ease the tension of a hot July day.
Green stuff indeed, snorted the lobster snobs. Don't they know tomalley is a delicacy? Green stuff indeed, chuckled the geographic snobs. Why do you think we give flatlanders bibs?
One columnist of note opined that these women must have arrived in Maine via the turnip truck.
As it turns out, their reaction was neither squeamish nor parochial -- merely prophetic.
"Preliminary analysis of data from tests conducted on lobsters taken off the coast of Maine indicate unacceptably high concentrations of dioxin in lobster tomalley," squawked an official advisory sent out Wednesday.
The press release was a joint effort of the Department of Human Services, the Department of Marine Resources and the Department of Extreme Pessimism; the letterhead alone suggests to me an unacceptably high concentration of bureaucrats.
Still, their announcement made a considerable splash. Women of child-bearing age should swear off the green stuff altogether, they warned, and the rest of us should cut back because "dioxin found in tomalley will contribute to the overall intake of this chemical, and to cancer risk in general."
This is about more than food. New Jersey and Massachusetts can maunder on about dioxin in shellfish and they will not raise too many eyebrows; but when Maine badmouths lobster, it trifles with its own state icon, not to mention the state treasury.
How to react?
Quibble with the science: The state bases its warning on a finding of 13 to 30 parts dioxin per trillion parts tomalley. First of all, the feds cannot even decide whether dioxin is dangerous, and they have been working on it for years. Second, at least one scientist says he never worries about eating anything measured in parts per trillion.
I comfort myself with the thought that I would never voluntarily eat a trillion parts tomalley.
Work the exquisite spin: The Maine Lobster Promotion Council earned every last penny of its budget Wednesday with this interpretation of dioxin in the tomalley:
"It is also a reassuring indication of the lobster's natural defense system at work, keeping the lobster meat wholesome, nutritious and delicious."
Yuk it up: "You know the lobster industry -- here today, gone tomalley." "Finally they found a way to get rid of the rats in Steuben. Feed 'em lobster." "So now our license plates have to have surgeon general's warnings on them?" And this was just in a newspaper office -- wait until witty people get hold of it.
Say "Never mind": Last week the governor went out of state. While he was gone, one of his commissioners reported that the Bangor Mental Health Institute could close. When the governor returned, he quickly spread the word that what his administration really meant was that AMHI would probably close before BMHI, but neither institution would be closed as long as he had anything to say about it. Never mind.
This week, the governor goes to Washington and three of his henchpeople blurt out some bad news about lobster. (Mind you, these people work for a man who, in national publications, is pictured holding lobsters.) Maybe when the governor gets back he can say that what his people really meant is that if dioxin were found in lobster tomalley, that would not be so terribly bad, but more study should be done before anybody says anything rash. And then maybe he can schedule state shutdown days for the next time he leaves town.
Of course, the likely reaction is a nationwide news flash and the same sort of lemminglike behavior that drove millions to throw out bacon, stock up on bran and quiver over their own mortality at every meal.
Then a handful of state officials can pride themselves on shooting a hole through both the lobster fishery and tourism with a single bullet. True, those two industries bring in a mountain of money for Maine's anemic economy.
But who cares about that green stuff, right?

FDA expected to list tough seafood rules

Author: Marian Burros The New York Times

Abstract: The new regulations are a major shift in the government's efforts to insure the safety of seafood. They are aimed at preventing health problems from occurring rather than reacting to outbreaks of illness, said Dr. David A. Kessler, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. In recent years, reports of several deaths from seafood poisoning, a devastating study by Consumer Reports on contamination of fish across the country and a constant flow of warnings from officials about tainted shellfish from various areas has shaken the public's confidence. Per-capita consumption of seafood in the United States has dropped about 8 percent since its peak in 1987, said Lee Weddig, executive vice president of the National Fisheries Institute, a trade group based in Arlington, Va.

Full text: The federal government is expected to announce on Friday morning that it will for the first time require the seafood industry to keep detailed records of safety procedures and to label all shellfish to show where it comes from.
The new regulations are a major shift in the government's efforts to insure the safety of seafood. They are aimed at preventing health problems from occurring rather than reacting to outbreaks of illness, said Dr. David A. Kessler, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
In recent years, reports of several deaths from seafood poisoning, a devastating study by Consumer Reports on contamination of fish across the country and a constant flow of warnings from officials about tainted shellfish from various areas has shaken the public's confidence.
Per-capita consumption of seafood in the United States has dropped about 8 percent since its peak in 1987, said Lee Weddig, executive vice president of the National Fisheries Institute, a trade group based in Arlington, Va.
Both industry and consumer groups favor a more rigorous approach than the current piecemeal system that manages to inspect only a tiny fraction of the nation's seafood consumption.
But while the industry is delighted with the proposals because they might reassure people who have been nervous about eating fish, consumer groups say the new rules will not do enough to reduce illnesses and deaths from the consumption of bad seafood.
"This is a very positive first step that we've waited for eight years," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of legal affairs for Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer group based in Washington that has long lobbied for seafood safety legislation. "We've got a long way to go."
The same kind of system is being considered by the Agriculture Department to try to prevent tainted meat from reaching the public.
The Centers for Disease Control says 9,000 deaths occur each year from food poisoning, but it cannot say how many are caused specifically by tainted fish, meat or poultry, the three main offenders.
Congress has failed for several years to enact seafood-safety legislation, so the FDA decided to approach the problem administratively, using the authority it already has. The regulations will go into effect one year after a 90-day period for public comment ends -- probably in the spring of next year.
Under the new program, the government will continue its inspections.

Abstract: OMB spokesman Barry Toiv said Thursday he could not release details of the proposed regulations. FDA officials also declined to discuss details, but confirmed that the regulations were expected to be issued this month. The FDA has been working on the issue since the National Academy of Sciences issued a report on seafood safety in 1991 recommending new standards. The Agriculture Department is working to develop a similar plan for meat and poultry inspection.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration will propose new seafood safety regulations this month in response to concerns about shellfish contamination, the White House budget director said in a letter made public Thursday.
The Office of Management and Budget has completed its review of the proposed requirements for seafood processors, which will be issued by the Food and Drug Administration by the end of January, OMB Director Leon Panetta wrote.
In the letter to Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, Panetta acknowledged concerns Congress members had raised about waning public confidence in the safety of shellfish and other seafood. He did not indicate what would be included in the proposed regulations.
They likely will address such things as sanitary practices of processors, regulation of growing waters and the temperature of the seafood in shellfish at various stages of harvesting through distribution, said Doug Levy, an aide to Unsoeld, D-Wash.
"Right now you have a patchwork of state regulatory approaches," Levy said. "We are looking for FDA to adopt uniform guidelines with the authority to make sure they are implemented."
OMB spokesman Barry Toiv said Thursday he could not release details of the proposed regulations. FDA officials also declined to discuss details, but confirmed that the regulations were expected to be issued this month.
"It's a high priority project," Michael R. Taylor, deputy commissioner for policy at the FDA, said in a recent interview.
The FDA has been working on the issue since the National Academy of Sciences issued a report on seafood safety in 1991 recommending new standards. The Agriculture Department is working to develop a similar plan for meat and poultry inspection.
Carol Tucker Foreman, a former USDA official and chief spokesperson for the Safe Food Coalition, a group of consumer, public health and labor organizations, said there is a lot of work to be done.
"FDA doesn't even have the name, address and telephone number of people out there processing fish," she said.

Abstract: Shellfish diggers and dealers face new state regulations that would change the way they do business, and some clammers already are upset at the prospect. What really has diggers peeved, said John Lemont, is the paper trail that could lead to a crackdown on the many clam diggers who don't file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service.

Full text: HARPSWELL -- Shellfish diggers and dealers face new state regulations that would change the way they do business, and some clammers already are upset at the prospect.
To protect the health of consumers, the state wants to force diggers to tag bushels of clams and mussels with the exact location of the flat from which the shellfish were harvested.
The purpose is to ensure that if a person eating a Maine clam anywhere in the country became sick, officials could quickly pinpoint the tainted flat and close it to further digging.
Now, when a bushel of clams is sold, the dealer records the name of the digger and the general location where the clams originated.
But if the Legislature passes the new bill, all that will change.
"None of us want to do it," Brunswick digger James W. Real said. For one thing, the tags are expensive, he said, and "I've got enough costs as it is buying licenses."
But what really has diggers peeved, said John Lemont, is the paper trail that could lead to a crackdown on the many clam diggers who don't file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service.
"That's what they're afraid of," said Lemont, a member of Brunswick's marine resources committee. "They're going to have to start paying their share."
Diggers aren't the only ones getting hit with new regulations. Shellfish dealers say they are feeling the pinch of new government standards.

Abstract: For years we did useless state-mandated flat surveys and yearlong area closures. It was a waste of time. Clams were dying and no seed setting in. Ninety-eight percent of Brooklin's clam flats are barren. The only places any seed spat can set in and survive is where there is fresh water. And when the brook crosses a main road, forget it. This tells me that where enough chemical-free fresh water dilutes the toxic chemicals in the flats, a set of clams can survive. I think our flats are irreversibly impregnated with toxic chemicals to doom soft-shell clams and eventually surf clams, razor clams, quahogs and marine worms. My sad, sad prediction is that within 10 years, clams will not exist in Brooklin.

Full text: I am writing in response to the article on the Down East clam industry (BDN, Jan. 1-2). Biologist Brian Beal is correct on one count: There is apathy among diggers and townspeople. But the most apathy is in Augusta, including biologists.
When I was a chairman of our Shellfish Committee we repeatedly asked about having soil samples from our flats analyzed. The answer was always that they were swamped with paperwork and besides, the state had no facilities for testing soil samples, only water samples for coliform, etc.
For years we did useless state-mandated flat surveys and yearlong area closures. It was a waste of time. Clams were dying and no seed setting in. Ninety-eight percent of Brooklin's clam flats are barren. The only places any seed spat can set in and survive is where there is fresh water. And when the brook crosses a main road, forget it. This tells me that where enough chemical-free fresh water dilutes the toxic chemicals in the flats, a set of clams can survive.
It also tells me that something toxic has been running into our sea water and settling onto our flats since early in the 1970s. Where the best clamming used to be near low tide, now the only clams are way up the beach. Apparently, the longer the flats are under water, the more poison settles into it.
I think if samples were taken of flats where there are clams and compared with samples from barren flats, there would be seen a difference.
Don't expect the state to do it. There is big money in blueberries and Velpar, and the state Department of Transportation will continue to spray its poison herbicides along the roads. Any tests would be either lost or labeled "inconclusive" and the studies dropped.
I have been a commercial fisherman and clamdigger for more than 50 years. I can't tell you the Latin name for everything that swims as the biologists can. I do know what I see happening over the last 20 years.
I think our flats are irreversibly impregnated with toxic chemicals to doom soft-shell clams and eventually surf clams, razor clams, quahogs and marine worms. My sad, sad prediction is that within 10 years, clams will not exist in Brooklin.
It is not, as biologist Beal says, due to our apathy or lack of management -- it is due to the fact our flats are poisoned and the state is doing nothing and won't.
Not to worry. Clamdiggers can trade their hoes for blueberry rakes and try to survive on three weeks' summer work. Meanwhile, the biologists can retire on their pensions in 20 years. If I were a state politician or a biologist, I would grow a beard and never shave again. I couldn't look myself in the eye, and when you shave with your eyes shut, you can get cut.

Abstract: ROQUE BLUFFS clam digger Herbert Richards Sr. returns to the flats after wading in to rinse his roller of clams. "I've made a damn good living clamming, and still do," said the lifelong digger. But where he used to harvest 10 bushels a tide, he now harvests one bushel or less. Many other diggers have given up as clams have become scarce Down East. (NEWS Photo by Scott Haskell) [Brian Beal], a biologist at the University of Maine at Machias, believes a lot more could be done to bring back the clam industry in Washington and [Hancock] counties. Harvests have dropped sharply in the last decade, and hundreds of jobs have disappeared. Part of Beal's job is running a hatchery for seed clams that some towns are using to upgrade their flats. Most of the interest is coming from southern Maine coastal communites. (NEWS Photo by Scott Haskell)

Full text: Brian Beal knows what's killing the once-mighty clam industry in Down East Maine.
"It starts with `A' and ends with `p-a-t-h-y,' " says the University of Maine at Machias biologist and shellfish expert.
"In the last 10 years, we've seen the collapse of a resource worth millions in Washington and Hancock counties, capable of providing thousands of jobs, with no action at the state level and no public outcry locally. What could be a powerful economic force in this region is being allowed to die," said Beal.
Statistics from the Maine Department of Marine Resources show utter devastation. More than 4.6 million pounds of soft-shell clam meat, worth $7 million, were harvested from the state's two easternmost counties in 1982. That figure plummeted to just more than 500,000 pounds last year. The 1982 landings were nearly 70 percent of the state's total. Last year's were less than one-fourth.
The job loss numbers are there too. Shellfish licenses issued Down East, theoretically limited by what local committees and the DMR agree can be supported by the flats, dropped from 2,200 to 410 in those 10 years. That's equivalent to the loss of 1,800 seasonal and full-time jobs, says Beal.
It's not, however, just a case of things being tough all over. Harvests in the southern Maine counties of Cumberland and Lincoln have increased steadily during the same period, surpassing Down East production for the first time ever in 1991.
The cause of the decline Down East cannot be known without a concerted research effort, Beal said, "and that's something the state and the communities haven't shown an interest in supporting. Until that's done, it's all speculation.
"For every theory, there are 15 others, equally good," said Beal. "You can look at environmental factors, slightly warmer weather and marginally higher water temperatures in southern Maine, which do contribute to slightly faster growth but don't explain how Down East accounted historically for half to three-fourths of the harvest.
"We're not talking about clams just not growing as fast Down East; we're talking about not finding young clams on the flats. Predation and pollution can't explain it. There probably are more natural predators in Scarborough than in Addison. Pollution from human and animal waste makes clams unfit to eat, but it doesn't kill them, and it's much more likely to be a problem in the more populated southern areas," he said.
One difference Beal is sure about is the attitude about managing the clam resource, and about clamming as an occupation.
"In Cumberland County, you find towns with active shellfish committees, working to locate pollution sources, basing their license numbers on scientific data from thorough surveys, enforcing ordinances, carrying out seeding and transplanting programs. The public perception of the value of the clam resource is overwhelming. They know that with proper management, this doesn't have to be a boom-and-bust industry," he said.
"Brunswick has its own marine resources department with a $60,000 budget and they harvest more than $1 million worth year after year," he said. By contrast, "Down East towns are looking at clamming as a less-than-honorable occupation not worth saving."
The attitude Down East is that raising "more than the typical one or two thousand dollars at town meeting is folly."
Beal isn't just another ivory-tower academic telling the locals what they're doing wrong -- he's a native Jonesporter who worked his way through the university at the end of a clam hoe.
More comfortable in waders than a tweed jacket, he often is found out behind the UMM science building, sifting barehanded through mud samples. Even his basement office, where computers share desk space with assorted mollusks, has the distinct aroma of the clam flat.
"As a scientist, I'm trained to conduct reasearch, to be dispassionate, but I do have an emotional stake in this," he said. "These are my own people here; half the people in Washington County are Beals. I know how hard it is to make a living here, so it's very painful to see this huge economic resource neglected."
Beal is technical adviser to the publicly owned Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery founded in 1987 by UMM and several communities. The hatchery produces 10 million baby clams a year and participating towns receive 500,000 seedlings for every $1,000 contribution.
There were some early setbacks in survival rates for the hatchery clams, Beal said, but an experiment showed how to increase survival dramatically, by transplanting in the spring instead of the fall. Meanwhile, interest in the hatchery has waned Down East, and support from foundations and agencies is threatened by the lack of local support.
"Southern Maine towns seem to have a better understanding of the way research works and the importance of stock enhancement. They're very active in our program. I had a call just the other day from Kittery Point. They want in. That's nice, but I would have jumped up and down if somebody from Dennysville had called," said Beal.
Down East resignation
The mood Down East is one of resignation. Alverie Preston of Roques Bluff and Arpie Alley of Jonesport have about a century of clamming between them and neither sees much hope for the future.
"I've been in this business since I was a kid. I've seen downturns before, but never anything like this," said Preston. "They've always come back before, but this time they're not coming back. I used to be able to make a decent living, but nobody can today. In the '70s, I could dig two or three bushels on a tide and make $50. Today, I could dig both tides and be lucky to make $50, but $50 doesn't buy what it used to."
Preston said the decline "is caused by a lot of circumstances. Nature just isn't putting out the seed, and even though we cut back the number of licenses, there are still way too many. There's no full-timers anymore. It's mostly people with other jobs who come in the summer, digging deeper and deeper, tearing up the flats. They've got a good steady job to go back to."
Preston's town issued 30 shellfish licenses this year, "and there's no way we should have had more than 10, with the condition of the flats, but cutting is very hard to do politically. We hash this over every year, but it always boils down to someone saying the guy next door has a license, so I want one too."
Alley, like most Down East diggers, is critical of the minimum 2-inch size law enacted in 1984.
"Not because of the minimum, but because they didn't put on a maximum size. The bigger the clam, the more it produces; you don't get babies from babies," he said.
Herbie Riggs gets $100 every two weeks as Lubec's shellfish warden.
"I've got 97 miles of shoreline to cover. It's impossible to do any kind of policing. If we seed a flat and close it for conservation, we'd just have people out there in the moonlight digging it all up for a few clams. There's just too much taking and not enough putting back. For this town, clamming's going to be a thing of the past."
Brunswick model
For management the way it ought to be, everybody points to Brunswick, where Marine Warden Alan Houston has a $60,000 budget, an Everglades-style airboat and an active army of volunteers.
"We have our own mini-Department of Marine Resources here. We survey our flats every year, instead of the three years the state requires. We seed, we transplant, and we find and eliminate pollution sources," Houston said. "We base our number of licenses, 88 this year, strictly on what the flats can support. Our top priority is to sustain clams as a steady source of income for the people of this town."
Down Easters might say wealthy Brunswick can afford to do what they can't, "but that's not at all true," Houston said. "Except for my rather modest salary as a police officer, our entire marine budget comes from license fees and fines -- lots of fines, an average of about $20,000 a year.
"We're the only town in the state with an airboat, and I can be on any flat at any time. That makes me real popular around here. When we close a flat for conservation, it's closed, period."
Digger Jim MacLeod, a member of Brunswick's Marine Resources Committee, says one difference between his town and towns Down East "is that we've always looked at clamming as a profession, not as a `welfare job' for people who can't do anything else. We have harvesters here making $40,000 a year because we're tough on poaching, we limit entry, we cut back on digging days, we make our decisions on the scientific information."
Brunswick also is willing to take on a threat, such as the University of Southern Maine, which plans to spread septic sludge on its demonstration cattle farm at Wolf Neck, and the state Department of Environmental Protection, which has approved the project.
Committee member Dr. Russ Pinfold, a veterinarian who can rattle off dozens of chemicals found in sludge, and the sicknesses and birth defects they may cause, says USM and the DEP "are making a terrible mistake and we won't let it happen. Bowdoin College was going to take part in this project, but we shamed them out of it and we won't let up until USM follows."
Chemicals questioned
One issue only whispered about Down East but openly discussed in Brunswick is the possible connection between the chemicals sprayed on blueberry fields in Washington and Hancock counties and the shellfish decline.
"It's interesting to me that they saw dramatic increases in blueberry yields at the same time their clams began disappearing," Houston said. "People there should know what's being put on the land. They should be suspicious of the effect on the intertidal zone. Those chemicals have to go somewhere; everything runs into the sea eventually."
The herbicide of choice since 1983 is Velpar, which gained federal approval for blueberry use through the work of University of Maine researchers and often is cited as a key component of the industry's explosive growth.
The chemical, classified by the EPA as "practically nontoxic" for everything from humans to shellfish, has been showing up lately in Hancock County ground water.
"Beware of those classifications," says Pinfold. "What you're talking about is a risk-assessment situation, where a certain amount of death and mutation is acceptable. I'd be willing to bet that there have been no studies done on the long-term, cumulative effects on shellfish reproduction."
Pinfold would win that bet. The DMR tests water quality only for bacteriological contaminants, not chemicals, and has not explored the connection between herbicides and shellfish reproduction since pre-Velpar days, when two-necked clams with gonadal tumors were found in three locations with high exposure to herbicides.
"What we found then was that the acid soils of Eastern Maine don't do a good job of breaking down some of these chemicals," said DMR biologist Robert Lewis. "No one has looked at what the herbicides and pesticides used now do to larvae, whether in some way they break the chain of reproduction, and we're not going to know until we have some research on it."
David Yarborough, blueberry specialist for the UM Cooperative Extension, said the university "has not specifically tested Velpar on clams, but there is nothing in the nature of the chemical to lead us to expect an effect on adult clams or the larval stages. I seriously doubt if there is any connection."
For Beal, the lack of solid data on herbicides is just one more example of the tremendous research gap for shellfish.
He suggests what is needed for the shellfish industry to survive: "From the highest levels of state government down to the local board of selectmen, we have to change the attitude that this is just clams. The state has to take these harvest numbers seriously and realize that a decline like this isn't just a natural cycle."

Abstract: In January, oil-soaked debris from a Maine Maritime Academy training ship was found at the Riverview Cemetery in Bucksport, and at a scenic turnout in Prospect. A Virginia company, Eastern Technical Enterprises Inc., was charged with the illegal disposal of debris removed during an overhaul of the training vessel. In Brooklin, momentum building to draft a harbor ordinance was superseded by town officials' apparent discovery last fall of an ordinance requiring fees for use of the Naskeag Harbor landing. Residents had complained last summer that a Stonington fisherman left bait onshore, attracting rats, and that bait also floated ashore in front of Center Harbor homes. The year saw the opening of several shellfish harvesting areas that had previously been closed, as the Department of Marine Resources found water quality in the areas substantially improved. Reopened areas included the Benjamin River estuary in Sedgwick, most of Crockett Cove in Stonington, and Curtis and Webber coves in East Blue Hill.

Full text: For hundreds of area residents, 1993 may be remembered as the year in which Applied Energy Services decided not to build where it wasn't wanted after all.
The Arlington, Va., company's withdrawal in October of the $309 million coal-fired power plant it proposed for Bucksport capped a three-year struggle that pitted environmental concerns against a desire for economic development of the town.
While awaiting the next round of court sessions in its appeal to overturn a town board's negative decision on the plant, AES officials decided to call it quits, validating the highly publicized statement a project manager made early on that the company would not build a plant where it was not wanted.
By the end of 1993, some local officials said they hoped to integrate environmental and economic interests in planning for Bucksport's future. Bucksport is expected to hold public hearings on environmental issues as officials draft related ordinances next year. At the same time, an economic development committee is continuing to plan projects such as an industrial park, as another committee explores the development of a marina at the local harbor.
In the Hancock County area, some of the other issues of environmental concern resolved or evolving in 1993 included the state's issuance of a consent agreement in March, following the discovery that biomedical waste found in 1992 at the Ellsworth landfill was disposed of by a housekeeping employee of an office building adjoining, and run by, Maine Coast Memorial Hospital.
The agreement fined the Ellsworth Hospital $2,500, and required the facility to serve as a collection center for needles used by household generators of medical waste.
In January, oil-soaked debris from a Maine Maritime Academy training ship was found at the Riverview Cemetery in Bucksport, and at a scenic turnout in Prospect. A Virginia company, Eastern Technical Enterprises Inc., was charged with the illegal disposal of debris removed during an overhaul of the training vessel.
In Brooklin, momentum building to draft a harbor ordinance was superseded by town officials' apparent discovery last fall of an ordinance requiring fees for use of the Naskeag Harbor landing. Residents had complained last summer that a Stonington fisherman left bait onshore, attracting rats, and that bait also floated ashore in front of Center Harbor homes.
Stonington officials have drafted a proposed ordinance banning the use of burners by local quarries. A petition had been circulated protesting noise and dust caused by burner use at a quarry run on church property.
In October, the formation a few months earlier of a group charged with monitoring the breeding success of loons in county waters appeared fruitful. Dozens of Loon Ranger volunteers submitted data collected during the summer suggesting that the breeding season had been a qualified success. The group, sponsored by Maine Audubon, is expected to continue its efforts next year.
September brought the reopening of the Clement septic sludge site in Orland, which for nine months was shut down after the Department of Environmental Protection ordered improvements to bring the facility up to licensing standards. After slow going the first couple of months, at least two of approximately 10 towns that used the site before the shutdown signed back on with the facility, the only one of its kind in the county.
The year saw the opening of several shellfish harvesting areas that had previously been closed, as the Department of Marine Resources found water quality in the areas substantially improved. Reopened areas included the Benjamin River estuary in Sedgwick, most of Crockett Cove in Stonington, and Curtis and Webber coves in East Blue Hill.
No one was injured during the recent emission of toxic ammonia gas at Allen's Blueberry Freezer Inc. in Ellsworth. Responding firefighters identified the source of the gas as a ruptured line on the company's cooling tower on East Main Street. Workers at the tower reportedly moved quickly to seal the leak. The matter remains under investigation.

Full text: Researchers in India and at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have identified two regions of a protein that set off allergic reactions to shrimp and closely related shellfish.
The discovery makes shrimp one of a few allergenic foods for which the actual allergen has been purified and identified. This may lead one day to a means of desensitizing people who are allergic to seafoods, an allergy that can be dangerous.
The protein, called a tropomyosin, is found in the muscles of all animals, with tropomyosins in closely related animals being most similar to one another, said Dr. Dean D. Metcalfe, an allergy specialist at the institute who was a leader of the research.
The studies began with an extract from shrimp that had been shown to provoke allergic reactions. The researchers tested protein fragments from the extract against the antibodies of patients allergic to shrimp. They isolated tropomyosin as the protein provoking the allergic reaction. Dr. Samuel Lahrer of Tulane University and his colleagues have made a similar finding.
Metcalfe and Dr. P.V. Subba Rao of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore and their colleagues then looked further to determine which parts of shrimp tropomyosin bound to the antibodies in the blood called IgE, setting off an allergic reaction. They identified two regions, called epitopes, that attach shrimp tropomyosin to IgE. The finding was described in a recent issue of The Journal of Immunology.

3 Down East sites eyed for seaweed farming

Author: Paul Sylvain Of the NEWS Staff

Abstract: More commonly known as nori, this reddish Asian seaweed, used to wrap sushi -- tidbits of rice, raw fish and other ingredients -- has been grown experimentally in Eastport by Stephen E. Crawford since 1991. Crawford, who is identified in the application as vice president and facility general manager with Coastal Plantations International, witnessed nori farming firsthand several years ago while working in aquaculture in the Far East. If the leases are approved, the nori will be grown on frames called ikadas. The ikada is described as a type of "raft" which allows the nori nets to be raised above water for periodic drying to kill weeds and other unwanted growths which cling to the nets. The frames are slightly larger than the nori nets. Coastal Plantations International estimates that its nori processing machine, located at the former Wass factory in Eastport, can process up to 150 pounds wet weight of nori an hour. The machine is designed for 24-hour-a-day operation, and as a result, is capable of processing "in excess of 3,000 pounds of nori daily, or 20,000 pounds a week," according to the applications.

Full text: EASTPORT -- Coastal Plantations International of Portland has announced plans to cultivate an exotic type of seaweed in three proposed lease sites in waters off Eastport and Lubec.
The Department of Marine Resources will conduct separate public hearings at the Washington County Technical College in Eastport on each of proposed lease areas, as follows:
1 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 11, to discuss an application for aquaculture lease consisting of four tracts in an 18.6-acre site east of Goose Island and southwest of Mathews Island in Eastport;
7 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 11, to consider an application for aquaculture lease consisting of 17 tracts totaling 82.64 acres south of Huckins Ledge, South Bay, in Lubec;
1 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 12, to discuss an application for aquaculture lease consisting of four tracts in an 18.6-acre site between Spectacle Island and Goose Island in Cobscook Bay, Eastport.
In an addendum attached to each of the three applications, Dr. Ira A. Levine, president of Coastal Plantations International, explained that a "variety of marine macro seaweeds" would be incorporated at the sites. According to the application, porphyra vezoensis, a species of porphyra, had been previously imported into Maine from Washington State.
More commonly known as nori, this reddish Asian seaweed, used to wrap sushi -- tidbits of rice, raw fish and other ingredients -- has been grown experimentally in Eastport by Stephen E. Crawford since 1991. Crawford, who is identified in the application as vice president and facility general manager with Coastal Plantations International, witnessed nori farming firsthand several years ago while working in aquaculture in the Far East.
Crawford, in an earlier interview, described nori farming as "a remarkable, vastly overlooked industry." Said Crawford, "In Japan nori is by far the biggest part of aquaculture, far bigger than finfish or shellfish. It's a $2 billion global industry, with $25 million worth of nori consumed in the United States each year, all of it imported."
In 1991, Crawford obtained a test tube of nori filaments from Dr. Robert Waaland at the University of Washington. The filaments were tested at Bigelow Labs in Boothbay Harbor, where they were determined to be pure. Crawford then received permission from Maine's DMR to introduce the strain into the state's waters.
According to the aquaculture lease applications, "The cultivation of this exotic species in Maine's coastal waters is dependent upon the issuance and renewal of an exotic species import permit by the Maine Department of Marine Resources and subsequent review by the Conseil International Pour L'Exploration de la Mer Working Group on Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms."
In addition, dulse, kelp and Irish moss from local seed stocks in Cobscook Bay would also be cultivated in the tract sites. "The culture material is being grown to seed commercial quantities of nets for the future cultivation of an indigenous nori sheet," the application states.
If the leases are approved, the nori will be grown on frames called ikadas. The ikada is described as a type of "raft" which allows the nori nets to be raised above water for periodic drying to kill weeds and other unwanted growths which cling to the nets. The frames are slightly larger than the nori nets.
Nori production in Maine is seasonal, varying with local water temperatures. The applications state that the vegetative stage of nori growth in Cobscook Bay extends from mid-May to late-November.
The reproductive stage, meanwhile, extends from September to April. This phase is "done entirely in wet labs on land," where the water temperature can be artificially controlled. The applications explain that the original seed came in a vial from Washington State and that "no further seed shipments will be needed."
Continuing, the application states that, at the end of the reproductive phase, clean nets are placed over the spores in a 6-by-65-foot "seeding frame" built out of 2-inch PVC pipe sealed for flotation.
Up to 50 5-by-60-foot nori nets can be placed in one frame for seeding. Seeding occurs within two days in May, either at the lease site or under controlled conditions in a wet-lab tank.
The seeded nets are then placed in the water in rafts -- the ikadas -- designed to raise the nets out of the water for drying one or two hours each day. "This drying is done religiously for three to four weeks," the applications said, "as failure to do so results in failure of the crop."
At the end of this "nursery phase," the nori is long enough to cover the nets, reducing the risk of unwanted weeds. The nets are then placed in production systems and will not be raised from the water again until harvesting begins, about 30 days later.
The applications explain that the crop is harvested using a rotary cutter resembling an upside-down, reel-type lawn mower.
"The nets are raised over the side of the boat, dragged over the mower, which cuts the blades off, falling into baskets under the mower," the applications said. Within two hours of being harvested, the crop is taken to a factory where it is processed into paper nori sheets using a Japanese-type nori machine.
Maximum annual production, according to the applications, "is 400-500 pounds wet weight after four harvests per net. The nori "becomes inferior in quality" after the fourth harvest, or after about six weeks of growth. At that point, the old net is removed and replaced with a new seeded net.
Coastal Plantations International estimates that its nori processing machine, located at the former Wass factory in Eastport, can process up to 150 pounds wet weight of nori an hour. The machine is designed for 24-hour-a-day operation, and as a result, is capable of processing "in excess of 3,000 pounds of nori daily, or 20,000 pounds a week," according to the applications.
If the leases are approved, Coastal Plantations International anticipates that the project will initially result in the creation of at least six full-time positions -- a general manager, supervisor, lab supervisor and three general laborers -- and four part-time jobs, with the potential for 40 full-time positions possible during full production cycles.

Abstract: High prices, weak markets, market manipulation and manmade quality problems are threatening the lobster industry with extinction, says Alan Baker, a spokesman for many of the region's buyers, processors and exporters. Colin MacDonald of Clearwater Fine Foods in nearby Bedford, the world's largest shipper of live lobster, says exports are down 30 percent. MacDonald cites two major factors. Fishermen are holding their lobster at wharfside in wooden pens called cars, controlling supply to drive prices up. At the same time, quality is down because the shellfish suffer stress and damage in the crowded cars, increasing the mortality rate.

Full text: HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- The alarm bells ringing in the Atlantic groundfish industry for the last couple of years are starting to go off in the lucrative lobster sector -- but for different reasons.
Unlike the withering stocks of valuable bottom-dwelling species like cod and haddock, the lobster population appears healthy.
But high prices, weak markets, market manipulation and manmade quality problems are threatening the lobster industry with extinction, says Alan Baker, a spokesman for many of the region's buyers, processors and exporters.
"It's bottomed -- we've gone to the point of complete disarray," says Baker, head of the Canadian Atlantic Lobster Promotion Association.
"We have an industry that is on the verge of economic collapse."
The warning comes amid the single biggest lobster season in the region. About 1,700 boats are currently working off southwestern Nova Scotia to haul a catch worth about $100 million a year to the fishermen alone.
The majority of that catch will be caught by mid-January, says Baker, with about 75 percent of those tasty crustaceans destined for export. Major markets include Japan, France and Germany.
But pocketbooks are tightening in their flagging economies.
"That marketplace is governed by economic factors, the most important of which is Japan and Europe are going through a recession ... greater than our own and with no signs of recovery," he says.
"Lobster is too expensive. People will not buy it."
Colin MacDonald of Clearwater Fine Foods in nearby Bedford, the world's largest shipper of live lobster, says exports are down 30 percent.
MacDonald cites two major factors. Fishermen are holding their lobster at wharfside in wooden pens called cars, controlling supply to drive prices up. At the same time, quality is down because the shellfish suffer stress and damage in the crowded cars, increasing the mortality rate.
The foreign buyer faces uncertain supply, lower quality and too high a price, he says.

Abstract: Most of Crockett Cove, on the western coast of Stonington, has been reopened after a closure that took effect in early 1991, said Paul Anderson, biologist for the Maine Department of Marine Resources. A half-dozen overboard discharge problems in the area have been corrected, some with funding earmarked for such purposes through the state's Community Development Block Grant program. In Blue Hill, Curtis Cove has been reopened, much to the delight of enthusiastic clammers who consider it a rewarding venue, Anderson said. Webber Cove is reopened, although McHeard Cove remains closed. The DMR took a new look at Webber Cove after a clammer said he thought at least one overboard discharge there had been fixed, said Anderson, who added his hope that harvesters won't hastily deplete what appears to be an abundant clam resource in the reopened Blue Hill areas.

Full text: LAMOINE -- Friday marked the reopening of two Hancock county clam flats previously closed to shellfish harvesting, including one that harvesters have clamored to get back for nearly three years.
Most of Crockett Cove, on the western coast of Stonington, has been reopened after a closure that took effect in early 1991, said Paul Anderson, biologist for the Maine Department of Marine Resources. A half-dozen overboard discharge problems in the area have been corrected, some with funding earmarked for such purposes through the state's Community Development Block Grant program.
Only a northern section of the cove remains closed because a stream coming from a beaver flowage has moderately high concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria.
Crockett Cove is considered fertile clamming ground, Anderson said, adding that the CDBG program has been particularly instrumental in funding cleanups of such areas. Towns apply for the grants, which then may be used to improve individual property owners' septic systems.
Property owners meeting income guidelines can get as much as 90 percent of upgrade costs covered.
Fixing faulty septic systems generally leads to measurable improvement in water quality, which can result in the reopening of closed areas. Delays sometimes occur when DMR officials have no way of knowing cleanups have taken place until improvements eventually show up in the agency's water monitoring, Anderson said.
Even in situations in which DMR officials themselves intervene in some way before the improvements are made, information on progress with the systems is not always communicated to the agency, which Anderson said can result in prolonged closures.
The nearby Goose Cove also was reopened Friday, although it is not a prime shellfish area.
In Blue Hill, Curtis Cove has been reopened, much to the delight of enthusiastic clammers who consider it a rewarding venue, Anderson said. Webber Cove is reopened, although McHeard Cove remains closed.
Webber and Curtis coves had also been shut down after failing septic systems were discovered. Several faulty systems reportedly are still plaguing water quality in McHeard Cove.
The DMR took a new look at Webber Cove after a clammer said he thought at least one overboard discharge there had been fixed, said Anderson, who added his hope that harvesters won't hastily deplete what appears to be an abundant clam resource in the reopened Blue Hill areas.
For more information on the reopened areas or the remaining closures, call the DMR office in Lamoine at 667-5654. The information should also be posted at town offices in the coming weeks.

Abstract: The demonstration project would experiment with composting mixed paper and organic waste generated by two Lamoine shellfish processors. Blue Ribbon Seafood Inc. and H.A. Boynton Shellfish Co. have started a crab-shell composting site on private property in Lamoine. The shells are presently mixed with sawdust. As part of the demonstration project, the shredded mixed paper collected by Coastal Recycling from schools, municipal offices and businesses would be shredded and baled. The shellfish dealers would pick up the bales of shredded paper at Coastal's [Hancock] center and transport the bales to their compost site. The Lamoine shellfish dealers will pay all costs associated with operating the compost site, as well as the expense associated with picking up the baled paper from the recycling center. It is estimated the shellfish dealers process 200 tons of organic waste each year. Coastal Recycling estimates it could prcoess 22 tons of mixed paper during that same time period.

Full text: HANCOCK -- Coastal Recycling was awarded a $18,938 grant this week to start a compost shredding project.
The capital investment grant awarded Coastal Recycling was one of 37 awarded statewide through the Office of Waste Reduction and Recycling within the Maine Waste Management Agency. The statewide total for grants announced this week is $2 million.
Each of the 37 projects are matching grants, with 25 percent of the cost of projects funded through local money. Those matching funds are already available in the Coastal Recycling budget.
For Coastal Recycling, the grant will provide funds for the regional recycling center to purchase a shredding system. Equipment will include a shredder, hay baler, engine and trailer to transport the equipment to its member towns. Twelve municipalities in Hancock and Washington counties are members of Coastal Recycling.
Mixed paper, including items such as paper towel tubes, paper board and cereal boxes, will be shredded and baled. The system will also chip clean wood waste for composting and landscaping projects.
Plans to operate a shredding system are linked to another application submitted by Coastal Recycling for a $20,000 demonstration grant from MWMA.
Coastal Recycling Director Nina Silvestrone said Thursday her organization has not heard the status of that grant application. Silvestrone said she is very hopeful the project will be awarded funds.
The demonstration project would experiment with composting mixed paper and organic waste generated by two Lamoine shellfish processors. Blue Ribbon Seafood Inc. and H.A. Boynton Shellfish Co. have started a crab-shell composting site on private property in Lamoine. The shells are presently mixed with sawdust.
As part of the demonstration project, the shredded mixed paper collected by Coastal Recycling from schools, municipal offices and businesses would be shredded and baled. The shellfish dealers would pick up the bales of shredded paper at Coastal's Hancock center and transport the bales to their compost site.
Because it would be a demonstration project, with potential applications for other businesses that generate organic waste across the state, the results of the composting operation would be monitored throughout the year. According to Silvestrone, the goal of the project is to determine the appropriate percentage of paper to shells for generating good compost.
The Lamoine shellfish dealers will pay all costs associated with operating the compost site, as well as the expense associated with picking up the baled paper from the recycling center. It is estimated the shellfish dealers process 200 tons of organic waste each year. Coastal Recycling estimates it could prcoess 22 tons of mixed paper during that same time period.
The application for a demonstration grant includes the cost of renting a shredding system for 12 months. The receipt of the capital investment grant provides money for the recycling center to purchase that equipment instead.
Funds would also be used to minitor the costs of the project, measure the nutrient levels of the compost and market the finished product.
One potential use of the compost would be on camproads. A Department of Transportation landscape architect has suggested the compost could stabilize shoulders and ditches on the unpaved roads. Clyde Walton, in a letter to Silvestrone, said the compost could not only cut down on erosion but could also protect the water quality of nearby lakes from excessive phosphorous runoff.

Full text: SULLIVAN -- Through the efforts of a few volunteers the Long Cove clam flats in Sullivan again may be open to shellfish harvesting.
The flats in Sullivan have been closed for years because of high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, which is found in rivers where sewage effluent is dumped. Water-quality tests conducted three years ago by the Department of Marine Resources confirmed that Long Cove was polluted.
"It wasn't that it was a major pollution station. We just found that once in a while we'd get these high scores of fecal coliform bacteria. That suggests there is a problem. It is an indicator of sewage, and if there is sewage in an area, it might have a potential for disease," said Paul Anderson, microbiologist with the Department of Marine Resources.
Because there were few buildings in the area, he said, DMR officials were uncertain about the source of the pollution.
Anderson said that although his department had not surveyed the area in several years, they knew the potential for pollution was there. He said DMR biologists were responsible for conducting such surveys.
"They'll take a team of diggers, draw a transit across the flat and dig at predictable locations. They'll dig, count and grade the clams and size them. The population surveys give them an idea of what there is now for a harvestable population, and what there may be in the future," Anderson said.
Because clams are filter feeders, Anderson said, they ingest small particles in the water.
"We measure fecal coliform pollution as an indicator of the sewage, because of the potential for those organisms to end up in the clams. If those clams are ingested by humans, and either are not well cooked or raw, people can get sick," he said.
Enter the Frenchman Bay Conservancy, a volunteer organization that won a state grant that allowed it to monitor water quality in the area every two weeks.
Gale McCullough, a harbor seal researcher who wrote the application for the matching grant, said the group had received $2,500 to pay for the testing equipment to monitor water quality in the area. The volunteers conducting the tests include R. Forrest Dillon, administrative assistant of the Frenchman Bay Conservancy, Anne Geier, Oliver Crosby, Jeff Boggs, Tim Rummage and Harry Cunningham.
Every two weeks the volunteers take samples of water and deliver the samples to the DMR laboratory for analysis. Dillon said water and ambient atmospheric temperatures also were recorded. Data from those tests led to the identification of the tributary that was dumping fecal coliform bacteria into the cove.
Anderson and Dillon walked the stream that feeds into Long Cove and discovered several possible sources of pollution.
"One of them pretends to be a septic system, but never really was one," Anderson said. He said effluent from that system oozes into Long Cove.
The owner of the system was anxious to get help, Anderson said, but until recently the landowner was unaware of the state programs available to help him. He said the Maine Department of Environmental Protection had $1 million to spend on such problems this year through its Small Communities Grant Program.
"The town has to formally ask the DEP for help, and they will. All they have to do is write a letter. ... The DEP will administer it. They estimate between $5,000 and $7,000 for each system," Anderson said.

No charges in lobster cargo case No criminal intent found for Connecticut rescuers

Abstract: [Bruce Hudock] said it took rescue workers about five hours to extricate two drivers. At the point of impact, [Driver Archie Pickering]'s truck cab had "become one" with the truck he hit, trapping the Deer Isle man's legs in a 2-foot space. The lower portion of one of Pickering's legs later was amputated at Greenwich Hospital. During the extrication period, rescue workers entered the cargo area of Pickering's truck to gain access to the driver. Some of the 50 lobster crates were rearranged, and ice and three crates were removed from the truck to make access easier. The three crates were placed alongside the truck on a foam surface, and the cargo area was left open. The decision stated that there was no evidence to suggest that Pickering's rescue was prolonged or affected in any way by the removal of the lobster crates. The workers reportedly removed the crates in full view of a police officer, a reporter, and motorists, rather than in secret. They also notified police of a money bag in Pickering's cab.

Full text: GREENWICH -- A Connecticut state attorney has decided not to pursue criminal charges against rescue workers who were accused of taking 14 crates of live lobsters from the scene of an accident that left a Deer Isle man seriously injured in October.
Based on the findings of a month-long investigation by state police, senior state's attorney Bruce Hudock decided the state could not prove any criminal intent on the part of rescue or fire personnel, who arguably would not have taken the $3,800 worth of shellfish had they known the owner meant the cargo from the damaged truck to continue to New Jersey.
Driver Archie Pickering of Deer Isle was driving about 50 crates owned by the Stonington Lobster Cooperative toward New Jersey the evening of Oct. 19, when the truck struck the cargo bay of another truck that was obstructing all three westbound lanes at the scene of a multivehicle accident on Interstate 95 in Greenwich, Conn.
Two serious accidents occurring on the highway that evening blocked traffic for several hours.
Hudock said it took rescue workers about five hours to extricate two drivers. At the point of impact, Pickering's truck cab had "become one" with the truck he hit, trapping the Deer Isle man's legs in a 2-foot space. The lower portion of one of Pickering's legs later was amputated at Greenwich Hospital.
During the extrication period, rescue workers entered the cargo area of Pickering's truck to gain access to the driver. Some of the 50 lobster crates were rearranged, and ice and three crates were removed from the truck to make access easier. The three crates were placed alongside the truck on a foam surface, and the cargo area was left open.
After the extrication effort, several Greenwich Fire Department members and possibly other rescue workers removed another 11 crates of lobsters and loaded most if not all of a total of 14 crates onto emergency vehicles, according to the state attorney's report.
The crates were distributed among several local fire stations, and lobsters were divided among workers there.
The remaining 36 crates were transferred to another vehicle by a representative of the lobster cooperative. The 14 crates taken by rescue workers had not been condemned by the appropriate state agency, and should not have been taken, Hudock wrote.
About 40 firefighters responded to the accident call.
After the incident, Lobster Co-op manager Skip Greenlaw filed a complaint with the Connecticut State Police. The police investigated, and Hudock issued his decision on Dec. 10.
Greenlaw could not be reached for comment Sunday.
The decision stated that there was no evidence to suggest that Pickering's rescue was prolonged or affected in any way by the removal of the lobster crates. The workers reportedly removed the crates in full view of a police officer, a reporter, and motorists, rather than in secret. They also notified police of a money bag in Pickering's cab.
"These facts are simply not the stuff of which criminal minds are made," wrote Hudock, who commended the efforts of rescue workers and their supervisors for their other efforts at the scene.
The rescue effort nonetheless was marred by the removal of cargo, Hudock wrote, noting that the cargo had not been condemned, nor had Pickering authorized its removal.
Chief Mark Dawson of the Sound Beach Fire Department, the official in command at the accident scene, was quoted as saying during the investigation that he had "thought the load would be condemned. It just happened."
Describing the incident as "distressing," Hudock wrote in his decision that Greenwich residents and business owners are entitled to know that their possessions and their lives will be protected by public safety personnel.
"The attitudes of a small number of fire personnel, paid and volunteer, toward the Pickering cargo can best be described as presumptuous and cavalier," wrote Hudock, who added that Chief Dawson ordered the taking of lobsters in at least one instance and gave implied consent to the taking of the rest.
Still at issue is whether the Greenwich Fire Department will make restitution for the entire loss, which Hudock contends was made possible by a breakdown in command.
New guidelines on the handling of cargo and personal property at emergency scenes also may be considered, and disciplinary actions may be taken against those considered responsible.

Abstract: It's enough of a challenge for many cooks to prepare dinner for a dozen relatives on Christmas day. How about adding the obstacles of violent motion, no refrigeration and two different kinds of meals to prepare? That's what the cooks on cargo ships in the mid-1800s faced, according to food historian Sandra Oliver of Islesboro. Oliver delved into the question of food aboard ships while preparing an exhibit to be mounted during the Penobscot Marine Museum's Victorian Christmas Dec. 10-12 in Searsport. Also planned are a Paul Sullivan concert, magic by Bruce Johnson, caroling and special decorations at the Fowler-True-Ross House. Christmas dinner in the captain's cabin would consist of roast chicken, chicken pie, cooked beets, potatoes, bread, tomatoes, rhubarb pie, mincemeat pie, plum pudding, fruit cake and tea.

Full text: It's enough of a challenge for many cooks to prepare dinner for a dozen relatives on Christmas day. How about adding the obstacles of violent motion, no refrigeration and two different kinds of meals to prepare? That's what the cooks on cargo ships in the mid-1800s faced, according to food historian Sandra Oliver of Islesboro.
Oliver delved into the question of food aboard ships while preparing an exhibit to be mounted during the Penobscot Marine Museum's Victorian Christmas Dec. 10-12 in Searsport. Also planned are a Paul Sullivan concert, magic by Bruce Johnson, caroling and special decorations at the Fowler-True-Ross House.
Oliver explained that the cook, usually a black man, would have to prepare two kinds of meals, with plain food for the crew and more developed meals for the ship's captain, the officers and their families.
"The cooks tried to recreate what the crew was familiar with when they went to sea," Oliver said.
Cooking at sea was grueling work, she said.
"Pots on the stove would be constantly shifting, with only railings around the stove to catch them," she explained. "The galley was a small, cramped space, which got incredibly hot in the tropics. He couldn't even cook when the weather was rough."
Food took on special meaning at Christmas time, Oliver added.
"Food is terribly important at sea, and the only way to celebrate Christmas was a special meal," she said. "It may look bland to us, but then, I don't think there's anything stimulating about a fast-food meal or a breakfast of coffee and toast."
The crew's Christmas dinner would consist of boiled salt beef or some fresh roast pork, boiled potatoes, unleavened bread, plum duff (raisin pudding) with molasses, and tea. Popcorn balls, cheese and mincemeat pie were other special treats.
Christmas dinner in the captain's cabin would consist of roast chicken, chicken pie, cooked beets, potatoes, bread, tomatoes, rhubarb pie, mincemeat pie, plum pudding, fruit cake and tea.
Meanwhile, families onshore in that era would dine on roast turkey, oyster soup, potatoes, celery, bread, mincemeat pie, plum pudding, tea, apples, grapes, nuts and oranges.
When cargo vessels left port, they would be stocked with durable foods such as salted meats, root vegetables, flour and molasses. Also livestock and poultry would be kept alive on board, to be slaughtered for special occasions. The ship's pantry would be reloaded when the vessel went into port.
Oliver first became interested in food history more than 20 years ago. While working at the Mystic (Conn.) Seaport Museum, she developed a program on fireplace cooking. She later branched out into food aboard ships.
Her research sources include ships' journals and logs, letters, business records, cookbooks and legislation.
Oliver publishes "Food History News," a quarterly that circulates throughout North America.
"Food history is a part of social history and women's history, and interest in it has grown over the past 10 to 15 years," she said.

State may ask clammers to tag harvest State hopes tags will track health of clam resource

Abstract: The requirement would represent a major change in the way diggers conduct business day to day, said Skip Applin, seafood technology supervisor with the DMR. Officials agreed that most Maine clammers are probably unaware that the change may be forthcoming. Although the tag requirement is likely to be unpopular with clammers, officials say any attempt by the state to circumvent the federal regulations would probably render Maine clams unmarketable. "As unpalatable as this might be to harvesters, I don't think there will be any choice," said Applin. [Gerald Poole] said clammers, like other fishermen, always complain about new fees or regulations. "I don't want to hear the crying because I know how much they make," he said, contending that clammers can earn as much as $18,000 a year, even as license fees increase and stocks dwindle.

Full text: LAMOINE -- A marine biologist says new federal regulations to be proposed at the state level should make it easier to track the health of Maine's clam resource.
Paul Anderson of the state Department of Marine Resources said this week that proposed Food and Drug Administration rules requiring clammers to tag their harvests upon bringing them into dealers could help enforcement agencies trace undersized or contaminated clams to specific sources.
In the past, officials have had to rely on tags affixed by dealers for data on where the clams were harvested. Brooklin shellfish dealer Gerald Poole said that system has been problematic, as diggers don't always supply buyers with correct information.
"Ninety percent of the time they're going to lie," Poole said, either because they hope to keep their digging area secret or because they're digging somewhere they shouldn't. "When you buy clams, you have to know where they're coming from."
The proposed change would probably require clammers to fill in the tags with their harvesting license number, harvest date, and the most precise digging location they can supply.
Poole supports the rules, which regional FDA officials say were agreed to about a year ago at a meeting of the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference attended by state and federal officials. Although the federal rules have been on the books for a year, some states have yet to disseminate the information or begin enforcement.
When the Legislature meets next month, the DMR is expected to seek approval to require diggers to use the tags. The wording for the state requirement would have to be drafted, and public hearings held.
The requirement would represent a major change in the way diggers conduct business day to day, said Skip Applin, seafood technology supervisor with the DMR. Officials agreed that most Maine clammers are probably unaware that the change may be forthcoming.
Informing all Maine clammers of the proposed change, and winning their support, could present a formidable challenge. "We have well over 1,000 harvesters in Maine, far more than in any other state" in the region, Applin said.
Although the tag requirement is likely to be unpopular with clammers, officials say any attempt by the state to circumvent the federal regulations would probably render Maine clams unmarketable. "As unpalatable as this might be to harvesters, I don't think there will be any choice," said Applin.
Regional FDA official Martin Dowgert agreed that clammers will probably chafe at the new requirement. "Here in Massachusetts, I'm finding that diggers are complying pretty well with it, although change is difficult. I know that change is hard for me," Dowgert said.
Poole said clammers, like other fishermen, always complain about new fees or regulations. "I don't want to hear the crying because I know how much they make," he said, contending that clammers can earn as much as $18,000 a year, even as license fees increase and stocks dwindle.

Abstract: It is critical that OSHA meet with sea urchin boat operators and urchin divers, scallopers and representatives of other fisheries, said Richard Steifken, a compliance officer for OSHA. "It is also very critical that we get the word out accurately, and be understood correctly" concerning OSHA regulations that are presently focused on the urchin fishery. On Monday, Steifken boiled down OSHA's regulations on marine commercial urchin diving by writing a one-page summary from a 16-page brochure of regulations that deal with urchin diving. He requested that the DMR insert the safety information with each $89 urchin diver license issued. Next year, all handlers of urchins will be required to have a tender's license. The Jonesport meeting, which may take place on Monday, Dec. 6, would be first in a series to stress safety in the urchin industry, because of the death of 24-year-old Matthew Rice of Old Town on Oct. 16. Rice was killed on his first urchin dive in waters off Jonesport. Last week, OSHA handed a $9,750 fine to Timothy Victory of Jonesport, owner of the boat from which Rice was diving. Three other divers have died accidentally in the last 11 months while scuba diving for the shellfish.

Full text: JONESPORT -- A joint meeting by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Department of Marine Resources will be held at 10 a.m. today at the administration's office in Augusta, to prepare an agenda for an urchin fishery safety conference early next week at Jonesport.
It is critical that OSHA meet with sea urchin boat operators and urchin divers, scallopers and representatives of other fisheries, said Richard Steifken, a compliance officer for OSHA. "It is also very critical that we get the word out accurately, and be understood correctly" concerning OSHA regulations that are presently focused on the urchin fishery.
On Monday, Steifken boiled down OSHA's regulations on marine commercial urchin diving by writing a one-page summary from a 16-page brochure of regulations that deal with urchin diving. He requested that the DMR insert the safety information with each $89 urchin diver license issued. Next year, all handlers of urchins will be required to have a tender's license.
The Jonesport meeting, which may take place on Monday, Dec. 6, would be first in a series to stress safety in the urchin industry, because of the death of 24-year-old Matthew Rice of Old Town on Oct. 16. Rice was killed on his first urchin dive in waters off Jonesport. Last week, OSHA handed a $9,750 fine to Timothy Victory of Jonesport, owner of the boat from which Rice was diving. Three other divers have died accidentally in the last 11 months while scuba diving for the shellfish.
Other safety meetings will be held for fishermen at Portland, Stonington and other smaller ports.
Meanwhile, the fine assessed to Victory has thrown the urchin industry into disarray. Boat owners, fearing they may violate OSHA regulations and be slapped with a fine, won't take divers out; and because divers can no longer hire boats, dealers aren't able to supply their markets.
To make matters even worse, some divers in the Jonesport area are considering buying their own boats to anchor on urchin beds, where they can continue diving. "You can understand how the divers feel about this -- they have bills to pay and families to feed. But this could result in even more accidents," said Stephen Geel, manager of the urchin division at O.W. and B.S. Look Inc. at Sawyer Cove.
"The captains are all shook up about these OSHA regulations," he said. Dwight Carver, Farrell Beal and Ossie Beal are three of the captains who have vowed they will no longer take out divers.
"The boat owners thought they were the employees, because we paid the checks to the divers, and the divers were paying the boat owners for taking them out," said Geel. "Now they find out from OSHA that the situation is the other way around. The captain is the employer and the diver is the employee."
The resulting mixup has paralyzed the urchin industry. "The buyers are running behind all over the state. For example, yesterday I shipped out six 60-pound totes of urchins for two divers. Last year at this time, I was shipping 100 to 150 totes every day. We've had some bad weather, but the real reason is the regulations."
For each 60-pound tote basket, the diver is paid $42. The diver pays 40 percent to the boat owner and retains 60 percent.
Last year, Geel had 12 divers supplying him. This year, four out-of-town divers are trying to stick with him. The others are odd-jobbing around the Moosabec Reach area until the meeting next week, when they hope OSHA and the industry will form some kind of truce that will enable people to go back to work. But both the divers and the boat operators don't want to work at the expense of safety.
"I work on a sales commission. That's my income. So, if the divers don't bring in anything, I don't ship out anything and don't get paid," he said. "Last year, December was my biggest month. If I don't make it in December, I'm out of business. It is that simple."

Magnetite called `compass in the brain'

Abstract: More than 90 years ago, and long before magnetite was found in animals, a French scientist named Emile Jarval speculated that humans might be influenced by the Earth's magnetic fields. He coined the term "sixth sense" for the ability that blind people have to avoid bumping into obstacles and believed it was a magnetic-based navigational sense that helped them to find their way in unfamiliar surroundings. Evidence for such a "compass in the brain" gained credence in 1992 when a team of researchers from Caltech, led by geobiologist Joseph Kirschvink, found crystals of magnetite in human brain tissue. Kirchvink suspected the presence of the tiny crystals, measuring only about one-millionth of an inch in diameter, from dark patches that appeared in some magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brains and which were apparently caused by the presence of iron. His team was able to isolate the magnetite crystals and show they were identical to those obtained from several species of magnetic bacteria discovered in 1975.

Full text: Over the years researchers have found magnetite, a magnetic form of iron oxide, in a wide variety of animals. It has been found in the bodies of Monarch butterflies and may explain, at least in part, how they manage to find their way north from Mexico to the northern U.S. and Canada each year. Researchers at the University of Florida speculate that tiny crystals of the mineral act as an internal compass by which the butterfly orients itself to the Earth's magnetic field. Magetite crystals have also been found in honeybees, salmon, homing pigeons, and even the lowly mollusk.
In 1981, British workers found the first magnetic sense of direction in mammals, the European wood mouse. When the animals were transported over 40 meters from their burrows in specially constructed boxes that isolated them from odors in their surroundings and sunlight, they still unerringly found their ways back. When transported in a box that produced a magnetic field contrary to that of the Earth, however, they became disoriented and actually headed in almost a 180-degree path from their burrows.
More than 90 years ago, and long before magnetite was found in animals, a French scientist named Emile Jarval speculated that humans might be influenced by the Earth's magnetic fields. He coined the term "sixth sense" for the ability that blind people have to avoid bumping into obstacles and believed it was a magnetic-based navigational sense that helped them to find their way in unfamiliar surroundings. Evidence for such a "compass in the brain" gained credence in 1992 when a team of researchers from Caltech, led by geobiologist Joseph Kirschvink, found crystals of magnetite in human brain tissue. Kirchvink suspected the presence of the tiny crystals, measuring only about one-millionth of an inch in diameter, from dark patches that appeared in some magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brains and which were apparently caused by the presence of iron. His team was able to isolate the magnetite crystals and show they were identical to those obtained from several species of magnetic bacteria discovered in 1975.
Kirschvink is not willing to speculate on the function of magnetite in the human brain. It might be a residual sensing system, he says, or it could simply be a means of storing iron. The discovery triggered widespread interest at the time, not because of its possible function, but whether its presence could cause adverse health effects in combination with low-level electromagnetic fields. We live bathed in a sea of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produced by household appliances, electric motors, and power lines to name but a few sources. Many people suspect that these fields may have some sort of adverse effect on humans but lacked a mechanism by which EMFs could interact with biological tissue. The presence of magnetite provided that link and inevitably headlines like, "Tiny Magnets Found in Human Brain!! May Cause Cancer!!" followed Kirschvink's announcement. Until recently, however, there was no evidence that EMFs have any effect on the brain.
A team of U.S. and Swiss researchers have found what seems to be a distinct response by the brain to weak magnetic fields. As reported in Science, persons subject to epileptic seizures were hooked up to electrodes that would measure brain activity and then subjected to weak magnetic fields. When the subjects were exposed to magnetic fields similar to those produced by household appliances, their frequency of epileptic-like response increased dramatically. One had 25 bursts of activity after the field came on compared to only three in the same time period without the fields. Similar increases were noted in other patients tested. Although only three severely-epileptic patients were tested, one researcher said, "I don't think this is an artifact. It's for real."
We may never know the answer to the intriguing question of why humans and homing pigeons both have magnetite on the brain. You can be sure, however, research on its response to EMFs is only beginning.
Clair Wood is a science instructor at Eastern Maine Technical College and the NEWS science columnist.

Abstract: The federal government is shelling out $455,000 of taxpayers' money to protect archaeologically significant heaps of oyster shells that were discarded over a 2,000-year period by Indians along the banks of the Damariscotta River.

Full text: The federal government is shelling out $455,000 of taxpayers' money to protect archaeologically significant heaps of oyster shells that were discarded over a 2,000-year period by Indians along the banks of the Damariscotta River.
The grant was awarded to the Damariscotta River Association, a local land trust. They plan to use $415,000 to acquire easement on right privately owned lots where the shell heaps now stand.
The Damariscott River Association has made $40,000 of taxpayers' money, right off the top.
What are they going to do with the lots, clean throw up and sell them or are they going to come up with a way to protect archaeologically significant heaps of oyster shells that were discarded over a 2,000-year period for the good of the taxpayer.
If the federal government can waste money on things like this, how can itsexpect to use a successful health care plan? Alfred Jenkins Brewer

Attorney wants more data on Lamoine suit

Abstract: Financial backers of the lawsuit were the owners of the two shellfish companies in [Lamoine] -- Dean Smith of H.A. Boynton Shellfish Co. and Mike Briggs of Blue Ribbon Seafoods Inc. The two businesses were informed last year that their commercial waste would not be accepted once the town's landfill was closed and the transfer station erected. [Hans Huessey] said Briggs indicated he wanted "to keep the options open" for a possible appeal. The attorney said he had not spoken with any of the plaintiffs about an appeal but would hold a meeting with them once the court acts on his motion and he determines the feasibility of an appeal. Smith said that next month he and Briggs will begin their own shellfish composting operation on private land they will lease for five years in Lamoine. The two business owners had developed a proposal with Coastal Recycling to operate a pilot composting project using shellfish and mixed paper at the site of the town's former landfill. The two companies average 400 tons of shellfish waste yearly.

Full text: LAMOINE -- The attorney representing six property owners whose lawsuit against the town of Lamoine was dismissed last week in Hancock County Superior Court has filed a motion seeking more information from the court.
A decision on whether plaintiffs will appeal the court's decision to dismiss the lawsuit is expected by the end of this month.
Bangor attorney Hans Huessey, who represents the plaintiffs in the civil suit, said Wednesday he had filed a motion this week asking for specific reasons why the court agreed to summary judgment in the case.
The civil suit, filed in July, called for a revocation of the permit granted the town for the construction of the transfer station. The six landowners contended they were misled by selectmen about options for the location of the facility.
According to Huessey, one of the financial backers of the lawsuit requested that the motion be filed and that options be kept open for a possible appeal of the court's decision.
Last week, Superior Court Justice Nancy D. Mills dismissed the case brought against the town. Two days later, the Board of Environmental Protection dismissed a petition filed by the plaintiffs calling on the board to hold a public hearing to consider revoking a DEP permit granted the town.
The timing of the lawsuit has been cited as a critical factor in both the court's decision to dismiss the case and the BEP's decision not to grant a public hearing. Assistant Attorney General Janet McClintock argued that any appeal of a DEP permit must be made within a specific time limit. The lawsuit was filed several months after the date allowed.
Huessey had argued a timely appeal by the landowners had been impossible, as the plaintiffs contend they were misled by the selectmen. He argued that the information on which the lawsuit is based was not available until after spring of 1993 and after the time period set by the DEP had expired.
Financial backers of the lawsuit were the owners of the two shellfish companies in Lamoine -- Dean Smith of H.A. Boynton Shellfish Co. and Mike Briggs of Blue Ribbon Seafoods Inc. The two businesses were informed last year that their commercial waste would not be accepted once the town's landfill was closed and the transfer station erected.
Huessey said Briggs indicated he wanted "to keep the options open" for a possible appeal. The attorney said he had not spoken with any of the plaintiffs about an appeal but would hold a meeting with them once the court acts on his motion and he determines the feasibility of an appeal.
The attorney also is awaiting a written decision by the BEP listing the board's specific reasons for dismissing the petition before deciding whether to appeal that decision as well.
Smith indicated on Wednesday he has no interest in continuing his financial support for any potential appeal of the court's decision. "It's a game the town can play for a long time, but I don't really want to," Smith said. "In my mind, things are pretty dead in the water now."
Smith said that next month he and Briggs will begin their own shellfish composting operation on private land they will lease for five years in Lamoine. The two business owners had developed a proposal with Coastal Recycling to operate a pilot composting project using shellfish and mixed paper at the site of the town's former landfill. The two companies average 400 tons of shellfish waste yearly.
Lamoine selectmen postponed consideration of that proposal in August while the lawsuit was pending.
Smith said he has no plans to reintroduce the composting proposal to the Board of Selectmen and will instead take his shellfish waste to the land he and Briggs are leasing for that purpose.

Full text: CALAIS -- The future of economic development and business in the Washington County region will be discussed at the first in a series of three citizen forums from 6 to 8:30 p.m. Monday, Nov. 8, at the Technical College on River Road.
The Citizen Forum on Economic Development is sponsored by the Maine Department of Economic Development. According to Michael W. Aube, commissioner of DECD, the forum will focus on the region's strengths, weaknesses and opportunities and the economic relationship among area cities and towns.
The Nov. 8 meeting is expected to identify regional services and resources. This would include an analysis of current economic effectiveness, proposed economic development, and preparation of a report to the Legislature.
By June 1, 1994, the council is expected to prepare a system of development regions, and by Dec. 1, 1995, the council must provide a long-term plan and a report to the Legislature and the governor describing the economic activity in each region and the extent to which the goals and objectives are being met.
Dianne Tilton, chairman of a five-member planning committee for the forum, said Monday that the second and third sessions will be held Jan. 3 and Feb. 28 at the technical college. Tilton is director of the Sunrise Economic Council with offices at Calais and Machias.
Others serving on the committee with Tilton are Richard Burgess of Machias, manager of Bar Harbor Banking and Trust Co.; Glen Avery, executive director of the Washington County Regional Planning Commission, Machias; Byron Burke, city manager of Calais, and Mary Follis, city manager and director of community development at Eastport.
Tilton said she hoped the sessions would attract large groups of people willing to share ideas on how to develop business and generate a stronger economy. With a population of 35,308, the county should be large enough to warrant consideration as a region by itself, she said.
According to the council's initial executive summary of the county's characteristics, the forest industry owns more than 50 percent of the forest land. The county is a significant resource of marine species, including clams and worms, herring, marine shellfish, and aquaculture. Agricultural crops are a major source of income, providing `tips' for wreaths in November; a healthy blueberry industry that includes a harvest in August and other jobs in fields and in three major processing plants; and a cranberry industry that is gaining attention and marketing potential. In 1987, 85,734 acres in the county was farmed.
The county's population is projected to grow by 5.3 percent during the next decade, according to the Maine Department of Human Services.

Full text: BEALS -- One of the best town clam industries in the state is the one at Scarborough because it has local support from its taxpayers and clam diggers, and because clams grow faster in southern Maine's warmer waters.
For a two-year investment of $2,000 in the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery's clam program, Scarborough's clam industry expects to harvest a total of 1,000 bushels of clams, valued as much as $85,000 in 1995.
"We were paying $3,600 cash for a million (baby) clams from a private producer, until in 1988 we started working with the hatchery at Beals," said Richard Haehnel, Scarborough's clam conservation officer.
"Our annual commitment to the hatchery is $2,000 and one full day of work at the hatchery for each of our commercial diggers." The hatchery is one of the best deals in the business, he said.
On Friday, Haehnel and four of Scarborough's commercial diggers drove eight hours round trip to work their "volunteer" day at the hatchery. Don Roy, Ron Willette, Keith Googins and Terry Twomey cleaned 85 window-screened trays that had been floating since July in the sheltered waters of Mudhole Cove at Beals.
After the cleaning, baby clams were graded according to size; young mussels were culled from among the clams; and the graded clams were packaged in 1-foot-square plastic bags. The 2-liter bags of clams will be placed in 24 secure metal cages, where the clams will spend the winter.
Next April, Haehnel and his diggers will return to the island to collect their 1 million share of the hatchery's 11 million clams.
"We will plant them in some of our best growing areas and where they will be protected against premature digging," he said. "Within two years, at least 50 percent of those clams will be 2 inches long and ready to be harvested commercially. We are fortunate down this way, because clams grow faster. It would take three years for clams up around Beals to reach the same size for commercial use."
Last year, 140 trays of clams were cleaned and sorted by supporters of Scarborough's clam conservation program. Since 1988, Scarborough has placed 4.5 million clams in its own flats. The town has expanded its original 50 acres for clam management, through water quality monitoring, to 150 acres.
The 85 trays processed Friday were taken from a total of 400 trays containing 11 million clams. The 85 were brought to the hatchery last week by Dwayne Shaw, the hatchery's assistant manager. High winds prevented Shaw from bringing more trays from their moorings.
Haehnel said his diggers are willing to donate a day of their time to the hatchery because their generosity earns them their annual commercial license three days before licenses go on sale at the town office.
The town has 25 commercial licenses to offer, including three nonresident commercial licenses. Twenty-three of the 25 commercial diggers have donated 12 or more hours to the hatchery.
Additionally, 25 two-peck licenses will be sold, and 240 one-peck recreational licenses will be available early in 1994. Any Scarborough resident age 65 or over can receive a free license to dig one peck of clams each day.
"If we didn't work hard and show it was a good and aggressive clam management plan, we wouldn't get the money" for the hatchery, enforcement and other program costs, Haehnel said. "We got started with a $5,000 grant from the Maine Aquaculture program administered by the University of Maine. We have given that back in time."
Last May, the hatchery received a $2,500 grant from Shore Stewards Trust of Ellsworth to build a marine laboratory to monitor the water quality over shellfish beds in the Moosabec Reach area.
Shaw and Lynn Alley, biology and science teacher at Jonesport-Beals High School, cooperated and opened the lab last June. Students are involved in the monitoring program. Next year, a grant of $1,000 from the Community Foundation will support the water project.
The hatchery and its programs have helped many clam programs in the Down East area. This year, millions of clams will be received by Swans Island, Islesboro and Friendship.

Full text: WALDOBORO -- The Time & Tide Resource Conservation and Development Council has received approval from the Maine Association of RC&D Areas to receive $15,000 for the Time & Tide Council's aquaculture specialist initiative.
Karen Sparrow, Pittston, Chairwoman of the Time & Tide RC&D Council -- which serves Androscoggin, Knox, Lincoln, Kennebec, Sagadahoc and Waldo counties -- said that the aquaculture specialist initiative is designed to develop aquaculture-related businesses in the district.
The aquaculture specialist position will work to develop the shad hatchery that has been successful for the last two years at the former squash factory in Waldoboro, and will attempt to increase the number of fish stocked in Maine rivers.
The specialist will also work with people who want to develop oyster businesses for diversification of their income, and several other initiatives that are on the cutting edge of technology.
Sparrow said that the $15,000 grant is approximately 25 percent of the total needs for one year and is a great start in the fund-raising effort to sustain this on the council for the betterment and improvement of the natural resource.

Volunteers, officials remember the day Kilkenney Stream died

Abstract: According to Jim Sohns, the water bureau supervisor at the Department of Environmental Protection's office in Bangor, investigators from his office had been called in to look at Kilkenney Stream by the time volunteers from Frenchman Bay Conservancy got there. "The whole stream was septic," Sohns said this week. Describing the odor of the stream as akin to a septic tank, Sohns said such polluted water could sustain absolutely no life until the stream has been able to flush itself over the course of several rains and weeks. As explained by Sohns, the pollution occurred when a pipeline from the blueberry processing plant ruptured or came apart at the headwaters of Kilkenney Stream.

Full text: HANCOCK -- A small group of volunteers from the Frenchman Bay Conservancy were there the day it seemed the stream had died.
"The water smelled very bad," Gale McCullough said of the odor coming from Kilkenney Stream at the end of August. "We took a dissolved oxygen test ... it showed the water was dead."
The volunteers had been conducting water-quality monitoring tests at 12 sites in Hancock, Sullivan and Sorrento throughout the summer, as part of their collaborative efforts with the Department of Marine Resources and the state's Shore Stewards Partnership program.
On that day in late August, the group had inadvertantly stumbled upon the rancid effects of pollution from a nearby blueberry processing plant operated by Hancock Foods Inc.
According to Jim Sohns, the water bureau supervisor at the Department of Environmental Protection's office in Bangor, investigators from his office had been called in to look at Kilkenney Stream by the time volunteers from Frenchman Bay Conservancy got there.
"The whole stream was septic," Sohns said this week. Describing the odor of the stream as akin to a septic tank, Sohns said such polluted water could sustain absolutely no life until the stream has been able to flush itself over the course of several rains and weeks.
As explained by Sohns, the pollution occurred when a pipeline from the blueberry processing plant ruptured or came apart at the headwaters of Kilkenney Stream.
For about 24 hours, the blueberry process, a liquid high in sugar content, went directly into the stream. The stream turned a dark shade of purple, the blue herons left and all life died in the stream that winds its way down to the Skillings River.
A neighbor who uses water from the stream alerted the DEP at about the same time that the company discovered the ruptured pipe.
"There is no question (Hancock Foods) is the source of zero oxygen in that stream," Sohns said. "The stream can flush itself out, but people were not able to use the water until then."
Although the stream has not been tested recently, Sohns said he assumed enough time has elapsed for life to once again return to the stream.
The case has been referred to the DEP's Augusta office, with a consent agreement expected to be worked out with the company. A fine also is pending, Sohns said.
For McCullough and others who have gone out twice each month to the 12 sites, it was a good lesson in why the waters of Frenchman Bay should be considered a vital resource.
"We're just ordinary people who care about water," McCullough said in recent days. "Water is like the blood of the place; it carries life. We've been spending one season with these (12) sites, getting to know the seasonal ebb and flow of a place."
Quick to describe the group's role as giving support to those who have the scientific expertise to monitor water quality, McCullough said most of the water tests are conducted at DMR's laboratory in Lamoine.
That office conducts tests that ultimately determine whether a shoreline area can be open to the harvesting of healthy shellfish.
The work by Frenchman Bay Conservancy members means that additional information can be fed to DMR's office about areas that are closed to shellfish harvesting. The group has pledged to continue to monitor the same areas for five years.
The Shore Stewards Partnership involves many groups along the Gulf of Maine.

Students investigate Seal Harbor pollution MDI project may benefit residents, water supply

Author: Kathy Harbour Of the NEWS Staff

Abstract: For [Paul Anderson], the work being done this fall by the MDI students and again in the spring eventually may help the Seal Harbor community correct the pollution problem in the area. According to Anderson, whose office conducts the tests that can open or close shellfish harvesting areas, most of the eastern shore of the island remains closed to clam and mussel harvesting. The pollution problem extends from Salisbury Cove to Sand Beach, and from Sand Beach to Seawall. Anderson attributes much of the problem to the several sewage treatment plants in the area.

Full text: The headline on a story about students investigating pollution in Seal Harbor was misleading in that it suggested problems with the town's water supply. The students' project has nothing to do with the town's water supply, which is Jordan Pond.
MOUNT DESERT ISLAND -- Mount Desert Island high school students, armed with test tubes and curiosity, are involved in some real-world scientific sleuthing at a Seal Harbor stream.
Sophomores in Jane Disney's biology classes at MDI High School are testing the fresh water of Stanley Brook and the salt water at Seal Harbor as participants in the state's Shore Stewards Partnership, a program that involves many groups along the Gulf of Maine.
The students have taken samples of water at several sites in Seal Harbor each week this month, returning to the classroom to conduct water-quality tests and to design experiments. As described by Disney, the "hands-on" science is, in part, teaching students how it feels "to participate in an important endeavor."
With water quality along the southeastern shores of Mount Desert Island described as "gloomy" by Department of Marine Resources biologist Paul Anderson, the students are tracking down sources of pollution flowing into Seal Harbor.
Students recently followed Stanley Brook into the woods and discovered an abandoned landfill. The water running out of pipes from the dump was surprisingly high in bacteria, Disney said.
"We know where the stream is clean and where it is dirty. But we haven't identified the source," Disney said Monday, saying the landfill is a top suspect. Hooked on the mystery, students have consulted maps, contacted homeowners and looked for other possible sources.
Aware that the waters of Jordan Pond at the head of the stream are clean, the students continue to look for one or several sources of pollution that eventually end up in Stanley Brook and empty into the salt water of Seal Harbor.
The three-year project is part of a larger project that includes the DMR laboratory in Lamoine and volunteers from the Frenchman Bay Conservancy.
Disney and Gail McCullough, from the Frenchman Bay Conservancy, applied for a grant and received start-up funding for the project from the Shore Stewards Partnership, the University of Maine Cooperative Extension and the Maine Community Foundation.
The state has encouraged such partnerships between monitoring groups and high schools, with 20 high schools expected to be involved statewide with monitoring projects in the Gulf of Maine.
Volunteers from the conservancy are conducting similar monitoring projects at several sites in Sullivan and Sorrento, including Long Cove, the Head of Flanders Bay and Kilkenny Cove. That investigation already has turned up evidence of a high fecal load in a tributary coming into Long Cove in Sullivan.
For Anderson, the work being done this fall by the MDI students and again in the spring eventually may help the Seal Harbor community correct the pollution problem in the area. According to Anderson, whose office conducts the tests that can open or close shellfish harvesting areas, most of the eastern shore of the island remains closed to clam and mussel harvesting.
The pollution problem extends from Salisbury Cove to Sand Beach, and from Sand Beach to Seawall. Anderson attributes much of the problem to the several sewage treatment plants in the area. One plant is adjacent to Stanley Brook in Seal Harbor, he said, adding that he is not certain it will be identified as a source of the pollution in the stream.
In Bar Harbor, Northeast Harbor and Southwest Harbor the pleasure boats add to the pollution, he said. Required by law to dump their bilge three miles out, many do not comply. In some areas, there are discharges into the ocean from private residences.
"It's a gloomy picture," Anderson said, in describing the potential sources contributing to pollution on the MDI shores. A biologist who says his job is "making sure people eat clean clams," Anderson said the high school water-quality project will be illuminating for the students. "Not everything (in the area) is perfect and pretty. They'll see that there is human stress on the environment right in their own back yards."
In addition to working on some home-grown mysteries, students also may emerge from the experience "able to think more deeply about the impact of water quality" on different species. Disney hopes the field research will give students the flavor of scientific inquiry. "They will learn what it means to be committed to something important," she said.

Abstract: The sanitary survey was compiled by Paul S. Anderson of the Department of Marine Resources laboratory at Lamoine for use by the DMR and the bi-country estuary project. He was assisted by marine biologists John C. Fendl of the DMR laboratory at Lamoine and David Clifford of East Machias. The report found that a number of coves in the study area may contain "significant populations" of softshell clams. These include Elliott Flats, Loring Cove, Broad Cove, Mill Cove and Lewis Cove. Those populations will be surveyed in greater detail next year. Others participating in the inter-agency meeting at the Federal Building were Eve Preston, community development director for Calais; James Sohns of the Department of Environmental Protection; Rob Rainer of St. Andrews, coordinator of the estuary project; Dana Nelson of Cherryfield, executive director of Down East Resource Conservation & Development; John Hewett, executive director of the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, Machias; David Garcelon, soil scientist, Soil Conservation Service; and Nathan Pennell, office manager for the Washington County Soil & Water Conservation District.

Full text: MACHIAS -- An international clam monitoring team, functioning under the administrative umbrella of the St. Croix River Estuary Project, met Tuesday and discussed a recently completed sanitary survey by the Department of Marine Resources.
The survey's results will be used with clam population surveys and a water monitoring program to develop an environmental management plan for the St. Croix River Estyary and Chamcook Harbour, New Brunswick.
Lee Sochasky, executive director of the St. Croix International Waterway Commission, presided at the meeting. She initiated a public appeal to all property owners on the river to become participants in the water monitoring program. "We will need 20 to 30 people for the program next year," she said.
Under the new Shore Stewards program funded by the Maine State Planning Office the volunteers will be trained to gather the weekly water samples. Water sampling kits will be provided. Sampling will take less than one hour and no travel will be required. The program is also funded, in part, by Environment Canada.
The sanitary survey was compiled by Paul S. Anderson of the Department of Marine Resources laboratory at Lamoine for use by the DMR and the bi-country estuary project. He was assisted by marine biologists John C. Fendl of the DMR laboratory at Lamoine and David Clifford of East Machias.
Anderson reviewed the study that was compiled last week to include the United States shores of the river from Elliott Flats at Calais to Gleason Cove in Perry. The area was previously surveyed by Harold Winters in 1979. Much of the area discussed in the report had never been surveyed for septic problems prior to the survey conducted in 1993.
According to the study, significant discharges into the river include: municipal sewage treatment plants at Baileyville, Milltown, and Calais and St Stephen, N.B., and paper mills at Woodland and Milltown. "These factors have caused the shores and flats of the St. Croix River estuary to be closed to the harvest of shellfish since August 22, 1969," the report stated.
Since 1969, the closure has been south to Gleason Point in Perry.
The report found that a number of coves in the study area may contain "significant populations" of softshell clams. These include Elliott Flats, Loring Cove, Broad Cove, Mill Cove and Lewis Cove. Those populations will be surveyed in greater detail next year.
Anderson explained that with recent improvements to the Calais municipal sewage treatment plant and renewed interest in the St. Croix Waterway by the St. Croix Waterway Commission, the DMR undertook the re-evaluation and shoreline survey project to identify problem areas and encourage pollution abatement.
The survey was conducted last May and June by the DMR. Water quality sampling efforts were increased during the summer, with additional help from Philip Holmes of the Waterway Commission.
Anderson concluded that the river should remain closed to all harvesting of clams until known sewage problems are corrected and water quality improvesd noticeably.
About 22 sources of sewage pollution were identified during the survey. They include malfunctioning septic systems, septic tank overflow pipes, licensed overboard discharges, active straight pipes, and sink drains. Details of the survey are to be shared with municipal officials.
Others participating in the inter-agency meeting at the Federal Building were Eve Preston, community development director for Calais; James Sohns of the Department of Environmental Protection; Rob Rainer of St. Andrews, coordinator of the estuary project; Dana Nelson of Cherryfield, executive director of Down East Resource Conservation & Development; John Hewett, executive director of the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, Machias; David Garcelon, soil scientist, Soil Conservation Service; and Nathan Pennell, office manager for the Washington County Soil & Water Conservation District.

Full text: BIDDEFORD -- This city may be fined $125,000 for discharging raw sewage and pollutants into the Saco River, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Monday.
The EPA accused the city of violating the Clean Water Act since 1986 by occasionally releasing untreated and partially treated wastewater into the Saco River.
Periodic government inspections of the treatment plant revealed that operation and maintenance were poor, the EPA said. In addition, the laboratory sampling and analysis methods were substandard, the agency said.
The Biddeford plant discharges 2.6 million gallons of wastewater into the Saco River each day.
The pollutants may deplete the water's oxygen supply and harm aquatic life, while high levels of fecal coliform may be a health hazard to humans and lead to the closing of shellfish beds, the agency said.

Abstract: [Janet Myers]' statements that the wetlands and seagrass beds of the upper bay are unimportant are just plain wrong and only reveal an ignorance of how the Gulf of Maine's ecosystem works. The upper Penobscot Bay is a very important part of the spawning and nursery grounds for most of the recreationally and commercially fished species of Maine. For cod, haddock, flounder and dozens of other fish and shellfish species, the shallows of the upper Penobscot Bay area are crucial juvenile nursery areas, both for them and for the smaller fish they feed on. ...

Full text: The ridiculous comments of MDOT employee Janet Myers trying to justify the construction of a chippermill cargo port in Sears Island only serve to prove that the decision by the EPA, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers and everyone else that believes in Maine's commercial and recreational fishery to oppose construction of the Sears Island woodchip terminal in the upper estuary of Penobscot Bay, is a decision wisely taken.
Myers' statements that the wetlands and seagrass beds of the upper bay are unimportant are just plain wrong and only reveal an ignorance of how the Gulf of Maine's ecosystem works. The upper Penobscot Bay is a very important part of the spawning and nursery grounds for most of the recreationally and commercially fished species of Maine. For cod, haddock, flounder and dozens of other fish and shellfish species, the shallows of the upper Penobscot Bay area are crucial juvenile nursery areas, both for them and for the smaller fish they feed on. ...
Wrecking the marshes and seagrass beds of the area to provide profits for a tiny international trade organization is not only bad science, but it is also bad economics. The experience in other parts of the eastern United States with this trade cabal is that they put local woodmills and furniture makers out of business by paying a slightly better price per cord than local businesses can offer. ...
The solution? Mack Point is more than adequate to handle central Maine's export needs. With the AES project kaput, there's no longer any worry about the coal powder from AES coal shipments contaminating wood shipments at Mack Point, so wood may safely, sustainably be sent through Mack Point.
Mainers have a history of doing the sensible thing. Blocking the Sears Island boondoggle is one of those sensible things, for the good of the fishermen, lumber companies, furniture makers and everyone else that makes their livelihood from Maine's natural bounty. Ron Huber, director Coastal Waters Project Rockland

Abstract: [Louis Rouviere] said he interpreted an incident last week in which bait believed to belong to [James Williams] was spread all over the bar as a protest against the fisherman's activities. Williams has been accused by local fishermen of leaving shellfish waste and bait littering the scenic harbor. The harbor has been cleaner with the advent of autumn. Lobstermen will have pulled in their traps by early November, and there will be no market for the bait stored in the harbor for sale to fishermen in other seasons, Rouviere said.

Full text: BROOKLIN -- Despite improved conditions at Naskeag Harbor, the Board of Selectmen still intends to pursue adoption of a landing ordinance.
Such an ordinance would govern use of the area from the landing and parking lot to the high-water mark.
Selectmen Louis Rouviere said no new reports of rats or trash being dumped at the harbor have surfaced, yet the board will spend the winter framing an ordinance that would go into effect next spring to prevent the kinds of problems seen this summer.
In late summer, residents reported seeing rats at the harbor parking area, where trash was overflowing from a town dumpster. The dumpster was removed to discourage dumping, which had included large items such as tires and a water heater.
Not long before, bait totes owned by James Williams of Burnt Cove Seafood in Stonington broke loose and beached in front of homes in Center Harbor.
Rouviere said he interpreted an incident last week in which bait believed to belong to Williams was spread all over the bar as a protest against the fisherman's activities. Williams has been accused by local fishermen of leaving shellfish waste and bait littering the scenic harbor.
Some of the local fishermen reportedly resent the use of the harbor by a significant number of competitors from other towns, who pay no fee to use the area the town must maintain.
Rouviere believes fishermen from outside the town should pay a fee to cover maintenance of the parking lot, which is used frequently by heavy trucks, and maintenance of the portable toilet.
The harbor has been cleaner with the advent of autumn. Lobstermen will have pulled in their traps by early November, and there will be no market for the bait stored in the harbor for sale to fishermen in other seasons, Rouviere said.
Trash and waste at the harbor have been at issue since at least spring.

Abstract: The Rev. Walter Dickhaut, interim priest, and the Rev. John Hedger, retired, conducted the blessing. Although it is unusual to see such a collection of animals inside a church, parishioners at St. Francis seemed charmed by the assembly of children and adults who approached the altar with their pets. Before the service began, Dickhaut explained the blessing. "The first part has to do with St. Francis, the patron saint of the parish; a person who was particularly and peculiarly sensitive to other creatures. ...," he said, "not only animals, but growing things, the stars, the moon, and planets. The other part is simply a recognition of the interrelatedness of all creation and all creatures." THE REV. Walter Dickhaut and 7-year-old Misha Bridges of Sedgwick have a rabbit named Jack in hand for the blessing of the animals Sunday at St. Francis by the Sea Episcopal Church.

Full text: BLUE HILL -- Imagine God's pleasure on Sunday, when some of his most gentle creatures -- dogs, cats, rabbits, a llama, a hermit crab and a stuffed giraffe -- were at his house for the annual blessing of the animals.
The blessing was held at St. Francis by the Sea Episcopal Church, a white two-story wooden church in Blue Hill, located on a quiet section of Route 177.
The rather austere interior of the church, with its single wooden cross, simple altar and white wooden pews, was a beehive of activity Sunday as dogs and cats curiously eyed each other while waiting their turn to walk to the altar for the blessing.
This was the fourth year area residents had brought their pets to the service to celebrate the love that exists between humans and animals.
The Rev. Walter Dickhaut, interim priest, and the Rev. John Hedger, retired, conducted the blessing. Although it is unusual to see such a collection of animals inside a church, parishioners at St. Francis seemed charmed by the assembly of children and adults who approached the altar with their pets.
The largest animal present was a large black llama that was brought by Mark and Dana Llewellyn of Monroe. Baxter, a 2 1/2-year-old llama, is one of 10 llamas at the Llewellyns' Apple Hill Llama Farm.
"We are primarily breeders, but we have wool production with our llamas, and we also do backpacking," Dana Llewellyn said. She said she enjoyed bringing their llama to church. "This church has never had the honor of having a llama here, and our llama has never had the honor of being blessed," she said.
One young boy brought along a picture of his animal to be blessed, while another small boy, dressed in a suit and tie, proudly held up his hermit crab. Hermit crabs have no outer shell of their own and live in the empty shells of suitable mollusks. The crab that came to church Sunday was dressed in an attractive brown shell and seemed unconcerned by the attention it generated.
Also in the church were a young girl with a large fuzzy brown rabbit whose nose twitched during the entire proceeding, and a small baby who held out a small green-and-white stuffed giraffe that had seen hours of cuddling.
Before the service began, Dickhaut explained the blessing. "The first part has to do with St. Francis, the patron saint of the parish; a person who was particularly and peculiarly sensitive to other creatures. ...," he said, "not only animals, but growing things, the stars, the moon, and planets. The other part is simply a recognition of the interrelatedness of all creation and all creatures."
Hedger said he had attended a similar ceremony in New York City, where elephants, giraffes and camels were blessed. "Probably, because Barnum & Bailey Circus was in town at the time, and it was a wonderful thing to see," he said.
St. Francis of Assisi was born in Italy, the son of a cloth merchant. During his life, he rejected all earthly trappings and founded the Franciscan order. He used to preach to the poor and considered all of God's creatures equally important to the order of the universe. Born in 1181 or 82, he died Oct. 3, 1226. He was canonized on July 15, 1228. His feast day is Oct. 4.
Dickhaut said the blessing of the animals was held each year on the Sunday closest to the day of the commemoration of St. Francis.
Hedger concurred that the annual blessing evolved from the fact that the church is named after St. Francis.
"The pattern of the life of Saint Francis was to live with all creatures and bless all creatures. Historically, the blessing of animals has been a part of the Anglican church in Europe. We are carrying on that which has been done in many other Episcopal churches in this country, too," he said.

BELFAST
Justice Andrew Mead handed down the following sentences in Waldo County Superior Court this week:
Kean Ripley, 30, of Belfast was sentenced to 60 days in the Waldo County Jail for violation of parole. Ripley was on parole after serving a three-year sentence with all but one year suspended for aggravated assault on Gregory Stevens on Feb. 8, 1991.
Among the conditions of Ripley's parole were that he refrain from consuming alcoholic beverages. He was arrested on May 22 for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. A test revealed that Ripley had a blood-alcohol level of 0.224.
Justice Mead postponed Ripley's sentence until Nov. 1. Stevens, his victim, is being held at the same facility on several assault charges, and is recovering from a suicide attempt two weeks ago when he slashed his wrist with a razor blade. Jail officials said they intended to keep Stevens and Ripley apart.
James R. Littlefield, 23, of Lincolnville, operating a motor vehicle after revocation of license after being declared a habitual offender of motor vehicle laws, 18 months in prison; operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, concurrent 30-day sentence, $750, and license suspended for two years.

Abstract: The harbor master for the Fox Island Thorofare area said Wednesday that a Stonington man's arrest for cutting several hundred lobster traps illustrates the continuing territorial battles among area fishermen. Foy W. Brown, one of North Haven's two harbor masters, said that several of his own traps were among those cut on Monday allegedly by lobsterman Sidney Eaton, 49, of Stonington, who was arrested Tuesday on Class C criminal mischief charges. Brown said Eaton has fished in the area for 30 years or more, and that territorial disputes usually have erupted between fishermen from North Haven and Vinalhaven.

Full text: NORTH HAVEN -- The harbor master for the Fox Island Thorofare area said Wednesday that a Stonington man's arrest for cutting several hundred lobster traps illustrates the continuing territorial battles among area fishermen.
Foy W. Brown, one of North Haven's two harbor masters, said that several of his own traps were among those cut on Monday allegedly by lobsterman Sidney Eaton, 49, of Stonington, who was arrested Tuesday on Class C criminal mischief charges.
The Department of Marine Patrol estimates that between 600 and 800 traps were cut, resulting in about $20,000 in property damage, not including the loss of unharvested shellfish.
Officials said Eaton had been observed cutting the trap lines in the area Monday afternoon. He was released on bail from the Hancock County Jail later on Tuesday.
Brown said that at least 10 fishermen's traps were damaged. One North Haven fisherman lost 300, and two brothers lost 200 between them, he estimated.
Brown said Eaton has fished in the area for 30 years or more, and that territorial disputes usually have erupted between fishermen from North Haven and Vinalhaven.
He said Eaton's alleged action may have been in retaliation for damage to his own traps by fishermen from one of the other towns.
As many as half of the fishermen affected by Monday's incident are relative newcomers to the fishery, Brown said.
The harbor master believes competition is hot in the area because of the relatively rich lobster resource there, adding that North Haven fishermen resent the influx of larger numbers of competitors from other, often larger, towns.
But Brown said he was unaware of any recent quarrels between Eaton and others until this week.
Tensions erupted in the form of trap cutting in the opposite end of the Thorofare early this summer, but incidents were resolved when North Haven and Vinalhaven fishermen made a gentlemen's agreement on boundaries.

Abstract: According to [Charles Rommell], [Sidney Eaton] was observed cutting the traps in Fox Island Thorofare Monday afternoon. Upon sighting Eaton during an investigation of the area Tuesday morning, the Marine Patrol vessel, Northern Lights, and a Coast Guard vessel escorted Eaton into Stonington Harbor, waiting to board his boat until landing because of rough seas. Officers from the Marine Patrol and Maine State Police met Eaton in the harbor, Rommell said. The fisherman was arrested without incident and transported to the Hancock County Jail, where Eaton later was released on bail.

Full text: STONINGTON -- A local man was arrested on Class C criminal mischief charges Tuesday in connection with the cutting of ropes on 600 to 800 lobster traps. The traps represented approximately $20,000 in property damage, not including the effect on income of any shellfish lost in the incident.
Lobster fisherman Sidney Eaton, 49, of Stonington was arrested after his 25-foot lobster boat was escorted by law enforcement officials into the local harbor Tuesday morning, said Sgt. Charles Rommell of the Maine Department of Marine Patrol.
Rommell said several officers from three agencies became involved in the apprehension because of shared jurisdictional responsibility and a concern that Eaton might be armed.
According to Rommell, Eaton was observed cutting the traps in Fox Island Thorofare Monday afternoon. Upon sighting Eaton during an investigation of the area Tuesday morning, the Marine Patrol vessel, Northern Lights, and a Coast Guard vessel escorted Eaton into Stonington Harbor, waiting to board his boat until landing because of rough seas.
Eaton was found to be carrying a .45-caliber revolver, Rommell said. Officials will investigate whether any prior criminal record would put Eaton in violation for possession of firearms.
Officers from the Marine Patrol and Maine State Police met Eaton in the harbor, Rommell said. The fisherman was arrested without incident and transported to the Hancock County Jail, where Eaton later was released on bail.
A continuing investigation has not yet determined the ownership of all the damaged traps, and Rommell had no comment on possible motivation behind the incident.
Rommel said trap molestation is not common, but does happen occasionally all along the coast. The amount of property damage involved in this case was greater than average, he said.
"That is a large amount of gear," the officer said.
If convicted, Eaton could lose his fishing license for three years. Rommell said tampering with traps is considered by Marine Patrol to be among the most serious of offenses.

Dragon gets cool reception on Georges River Fishermen, others raise concerns about dredging

Abstract: Although he agreed there was a problem with "the channel situation," [Peter Lammert] reminded those attending the meeting that Dragon Products accounted for one-third of the town's tax base. He speculated that the cement plant might be attracted to Thomaston because rail access to its waterfront property would not disrupt the tranquility of a residential neighborhood, as would be the case in Rockland. Selectman Stephen Mazzeo agreed. Mazzeo said he was present at a recent meeting between Dragon executives and Rockland officials. He said the company indicated to him that "Thomaston didn't fit into the process. ... They really prefer to do their hauling out of Rockland." James McCammett, a retired cement plant executive, said the company has the technology to perform the task. He said a similar project was studied 35 years ago, "because I was the one who did it." McCammett said Dragon needs to expand its customer base to remain in business. He assured the board that Dragon would abide by its regulations if it decided to locate a barge facility in town.

Full text: THOMASTON -- With the Georges River on the verge of becoming pollution-free and a thriving fishery once again, caution was raised over the idea of dredging the river to accommodate barge traffic for Dragon Products.
Fishermen, advocates for the environment and defenders of the river met with the Board of Selectmen Monday to warn against giving blanket support to Dragon in the event the company attempted to barge cement down river.
The meeting was also attended by residents who warned against dismissing Dragon out of hand without giving the company's plans a fair hearing.
Dragon officials have given no indication they intend to ship cement from a site the firm owns along the riverfront south of the Maine Coast Railroad trestle spanning Mill Creek.
Despite the company's silence, board Chairman Peter Lammert decided the idea deserved an official discussion after residents of Rockland's South End voiced strong opposition to Dragon's proposal to ship cement from the former Stinson Canning factory on Atlantic Point.
Although he agreed there was a problem with "the channel situation," Lammert reminded those attending the meeting that Dragon Products accounted for one-third of the town's tax base. He speculated that the cement plant might be attracted to Thomaston because rail access to its waterfront property would not disrupt the tranquility of a residential neighborhood, as would be the case in Rockland.
Jon Eaton of the Georges River Tidewater Association disagreed. Eaton pointed out that "massive dredging" of the river and its clam flats would be needed to handle the cement barges. He said the 50-by-250-foot barges have a 14-foot draft and carry 4,000 tons.
"Rockland is a deepwater port, Thomaston is not," Eaton said. "There is a major difference in dredging to a 10-foot minimum, which Thomaston has, to a depth of 18 feet for those barges. ... I would love to see them use the train line to get the cement to Rockland."
Eaton said the "configuration" of the river's estuary made it the "least viable option."
Selectman Stephen Mazzeo agreed. Mazzeo said he was present at a recent meeting between Dragon executives and Rockland officials. He said the company indicated to him that "Thomaston didn't fit into the process. ... They really prefer to do their hauling out of Rockland."
James McCammett, a retired cement plant executive, said the company has the technology to perform the task. He said a similar project was studied 35 years ago, "because I was the one who did it." McCammett said Dragon needs to expand its customer base to remain in business. He assured the board that Dragon would abide by its regulations if it decided to locate a barge facility in town.
Harbor Committee member Jeff Armstrong warned that a major dredging program to accommodate barge traffic would create "a situation where they are going to be taking over the river."
Mac Hyler said the town should be prepared to "co-exist" with Dragon. Hyler said he doubted a "reputable company" would attempt to bypass environmental regulations.
"I don't want to see any fishermen lose their jobs ... but we're living in a changing world," Hyler said.
When a Cushing fisherman remarked that the river was expected to be reopened for the harvesting of shellfish in a few years, Lammert said he was looking forward to the "war of the clam flats when the United Coast of Maine tries to dig that river on that first tide. It will be like the Oklahoma land rush."
Another out-of-town fisherman observed that "there hasn't been a smelt up the creek" since the river was last dredged in the mid-1970s. He added that striped bass were making a comeback and warned that another dredging program could be harmful to the river.
Cabot Lyman said that while he would "like to see some action" along the river he doubted the town could promote development with any success because of the fishing grounds. He said recreational boaters stay away during the summer because they do not want to disturb the lobster traps.
"You can open that river," Lyman said. "But you're going to have to do it over the dead bodies of the Cushing fishermen."

Abstract: This recipe for steamed mussels with mustard sauce can be prepared in less than a half-hour. Onions, shallots, garlic and butter form the basis for the sauce. When the mussels cook, they release their brine into the sauce. A touch of mustard at the end adds a piquant edge. You could also experiment with other flavors, like curry, fennel or Oriental spices.

Full text: Anyone who has been to a fish market in recent years knows that seafood prices have risen faster than a Maine tide. Cooks on a budget have to be resourceful, seeking lesser-known species in the market and being imaginative with preparation.
I recall how in the early 1980s American fishermen tossed monkfish back to sea because no market existed for them. The same applied to skate. To be sure, neither would win a deep-sea beauty contest. But each has distinctive flavors and textures that have been prized in Europe for centuries.
Today, both skate and monkfish are considered delicacies and are getting more expensive every year.
And what about mussels? Americans have long been shellfish lovers, but their attention has focused on oysters, clams, lobsters and shrimp. Mussels, bivalves that cling to coral and rocks, were always considered cheap and ordinary. Today, home cooks are learning how delicious mussels can be with the least amount of fuss. And they are far less expensive than oysters and clams.
Mussels are easy to clean. Immerse them in a bowl of cold tap water and stir them with your hand. When the water gets sandy, repeat with clean water two or three times. Cultivated mussels like those in Maine are cleaner than wild ones.
This recipe for steamed mussels with mustard sauce can be prepared in less than a half-hour. Onions, shallots, garlic and butter form the basis for the sauce. When the mussels cook, they release their brine into the sauce. A touch of mustard at the end adds a piquant edge. You could also experiment with other flavors, like curry, fennel or Oriental spices.
A steaming bowl of mussels with mustard sauce makes a fine lunch entree. A good side dish is sliced tomatoes with onions, a garlicky vinaigrette and blue heese. The broth has flavor to stand up to the cheese.

Neighbors raise stink over shore conditions Naskeag Harbor landing fee suggested

Abstract: It's not unusual for rats to feed in harbor areas, said [Louis Rouviere], asserting he was unaware of their presence at Naskeag until now. At the selectmen's request, Marine Patrol officer John Mitchell reportedly asked Stonington fisherman Jim Williams to do something about his bait totes, some of which apparently had broken loose from his boat and floated to Center Harbor about a month ago. Rouviere recalled one woman trying to barbecue while fumes from the fetid bait nearly overpowered her and her cooking. "I told her to turn up her charcoal," said Rouviere, who chuckled in hindsight. Echoing [Gerard Poole]'s contention of last spring, Rouviere said Tuesday that a fee should be instituted for fishermen using the harbor landing. He believes the many out-of-town fishermen who profit from the harbor's use at town expense should pay a fee to help cover costs for items such as maintenance of the parking lot and of a portable toilet.

Full text: BROOKLIN -- Critics of conditions at a local harbor have not only smelled a rat -- now they've seen them, and town officials say they are taking action.
Mussels, rotten bait and now bulky wastes have at various times been left to fester on, or to clutter, the scenic shore of Naskeag Harbor, a popular launching point for commercial fishermen.
Recent reports of rats foraging among spilled bait and overflowing trash have pushed the issue of harbor conditions back onto the Board of Selectmen's agenda.
Last spring, mussel waste left on shore prompted a complaint by resident and shellfish dealer Gerard Poole. That led to a cooperative cleanup of the shore, and to Poole's ultimate withdrawal of the complaint he had filed with town officials and area legislators.
Poole said in April that he hoped awareness raised during that particular incident, which was blamed on a Stonington-based commercial fisherman, would result in at least a brief period of soul-searching among town officials and the Brooklin Fishermen's Association as to whether a harbor ordinance should be enacted to curb the problems.
In addition to the mussel waste, Poole had cited the presence of human fecal deposits "all over the shore" and overcrowding of boats in the harbor as reasons for his complaint.
The Fishermen's Association decided not to back such an initiative, contending that the precipitating problem had been solved. Poole predicted that the issue would arise again.
Discovery of a water heater and tires dumped at the harbor was one of several recent events leading selectmen to look anew at the harbor situation, this time with the thought of enacting a landing ordinance to govern the zone between the high-water mark on town-owned land and the boats.
The board decided at its weekly meeting Tuesday to remove the harbor parking lot's dumpster to discourage people who have dumped bulky trash there. Selectman Louis Rouviere said the town picked up some excess trash at the lot all summer, but thought the problem would fade as the season ended.
Then the bulky wastes appeared, bait washed up near people's homes and rats were reported.

At the selectmen's request, Marine Patrol officer John Mitchell reportedly asked Stonington fisherman Jim Williams to do something about his bait totes, some of which apparently had broken loose from his boat and floated to Center Harbor about a month ago.
The bait washed up in front of residents' homes, where it lay rotting until Williams had it removed, Rouviere said.

Heavy trucks use the lot for picking up the bags of mussels fishermen leave on Naskeag Bar, Rouviere added, and the town eventually will have to pay for resurfacing.
Acknowledging that harbor conditions have deteriorated since spring and early summer, Rouviere said the "possibility of it getting back to a crisis stage is still there."

Pending lawsuit stalls debate on merits of shellfish composting

Abstract: Financial backers of the lawsuit are the owners of the two shellfish companies in [Lamoine], the same people who have proposed to operate a shellfish composting project at the site of the former landfill. [Dean Smith] and [Mike Briggs] had developed a proposal with Coastal Recycling to operate a pilot composting program using shellfish and mixed paper at the site of the town's former landfill. Since the construction of the transfer station, the shellfish dealers can no longer dispose of the shells at a town facility. Complicating any consideration of the proposal for the selectmen is the continuing lawsuit, [Dick Davis] explained. Despite assertions by the shellfish dealers that the lawsuit and the composting proposal should not be tied, Davis said selectmen think there is an important link. "We told them when the litigation is settled or dropped, then we will talk about composting," Davis said.

Full text: LAMOINE -- No public debate can be expected on the merits of a shellfish composting program until a lawsuit pending against the town is either dropped or settled.
According to Lamoine selectman Dick Davis, the three selectmen voted in recent days to postpone any decision or public hearing on the composting proposal while the lawsuit is pending.
The lawsuit, filed on July 1 by six Lamoine landowners with property adjacent to the new transfer station, calls for a revocation of the DEP permit granted the town for the construction of the transfer station. The abutters seek to revoke the setback waivers they signed, contending they were misled by one or more selectmen about options for the transfer station.
Financial backers of the lawsuit are the owners of the two shellfish companies in Lamoine, the same people who have proposed to operate a shellfish composting project at the site of the former landfill.
The position by Lamoine's Board of Selectmen may prompt another lawsuit against the town, one of the shellfish dealers said Friday.
For shellfish dealer Dean Smith, owner of H.A. Boynton Shellfish Co., the selectmen's position is "plain and simple blackmail. Tying the two issues together is asinine," Smith said Friday.
Smith said he and Mike Briggs, owner of Blue Ribbon Seafoods Inc., are now seriously considering filing their own lawsuit against the town. "We want a spot to compost," Smith said Friday.
Smith and Briggs had developed a proposal with Coastal Recycling to operate a pilot composting program using shellfish and mixed paper at the site of the town's former landfill. Since the construction of the transfer station, the shellfish dealers can no longer dispose of the shells at a town facility.
The dealers said they would cover any operating costs associated with the composting operation in order to have a nearby spot to dispose of their commercial waste. Coastal Recycling had proposed it would collect, shred and bale paper from selected businesses and schools to mix with the shellfish waste. The organization had also proposed that it would work to distribute or market the finished compost.
Complicating any consideration of the proposal for the selectmen is the continuing lawsuit, Davis explained. Despite assertions by the shellfish dealers that the lawsuit and the composting proposal should not be tied, Davis said selectmen think there is an important link. "We told them when the litigation is settled or dropped, then we will talk about composting," Davis said.
The dealers insist the proposal should be considered separate from the lawsuit. Smith said he and Briggs have no intention of withdrawing their financial support for the lawsuit.
Smith took issue with the selectmen's assertion that they could not consider a composting operation on the landfill property while that land is the subject of litigation. "But they didn't hesitate to go ahead and build a transfer station with the lawsuit pending,' he said.
"They are using baloney excuses," Smith added.
Selectmen, however, contend any decision about use of the landfill property should wait until the litigation is settled, as the people wanting to compost are the same ones financing the lawsuit.
Nina Silvestrone, executive director for Coastal Recycling, indicated her organization will look elsewhere for suitable property for the pilot project.

Maine's eider ducks are back Coastal bird's decline reversed by protections

Author: Tom Hennessey Of the NEWS Staff

Abstract: In autumn, it isn't unusual nowadays to see mile-long "rafts" of common eiders -- also called American eiders -- riding the gray swells surging along Maine's granite-sculptured coast. Conversely, it's difficult to imagine that, at the turn of the century, Maine's breeding population of common eiders -- Maine and Alaska have the only breeding populations of eiders in the United States -- was nearly eradicated. Not surprisingly, the culprit was man. During the 1800s, the fishermen-farmers inhabiting Maine's coast, including its islands, more than appreciated the meat, eggs and down of eiders. Therefore, the largest of North America's ducks -- an adult male eider weighs about 5 pounds, an adult female weighs about a pound less -- were exploited to the extreme. Because the ducks nest in colonies on uninhabited offshore islands, egg-gathering expeditions were unconscionably productive. Overhunting, especially during nesting seasons, also contributed greatly to the decline of Maine's eiders. So relentless were the assaults of man on the seemingly inexhaustible resource that by the early 1900s Maine's breeding population of common eiders reached its lowest known level. In 1907, for example, the National Association of Audubon Societies (now the National Audubon Society) reported only two pairs of eiders breeding on Old Man Island, lying about three miles southwest of Cutler. That year, the society provided the first protection for several species of Maine's sea birds, common eiders among them, by hiring wardens to protect nesting islands.

Full text: In autumn, it isn't unusual nowadays to see mile-long "rafts" of common eiders -- also called American eiders -- riding the gray swells surging along Maine's granite-sculptured coast. Conversely, it's difficult to imagine that, at the turn of the century, Maine's breeding population of common eiders -- Maine and Alaska have the only breeding populations of eiders in the United States -- was nearly eradicated. Not surprisingly, the culprit was man.
During the 1800s, the fishermen-farmers inhabiting Maine's coast, including its islands, more than appreciated the meat, eggs and down of eiders. Therefore, the largest of North America's ducks -- an adult male eider weighs about 5 pounds, an adult female weighs about a pound less -- were exploited to the extreme. Because the ducks nest in colonies on uninhabited offshore islands, egg-gathering expeditions were unconscionably productive. Overhunting, especially during nesting seasons, also contributed greatly to the decline of Maine's eiders.
In the 19th century, however, sea duck hunting didn't necessarily relate to sport shooting, which was expensive and often ineffectual. Practicality dictated a much more efficient method, which was to drive ducks into confined areas -- coves, inlets, small bays -- where they were slaughtered.
Not by chance, then, do the words "egg" and "duck" appear frequently in the names of many Maine-coast locations: Egg Rock, Egg Island, Duck Cove, Duck Inlet, Great Duck Island, Ducktrap Bay, to name a few.
So relentless were the assaults of man on the seemingly inexhaustible resource that by the early 1900s Maine's breeding population of common eiders reached its lowest known level. In 1907, for example, the National Association of Audubon Societies (now the National Audubon Society) reported only two pairs of eiders breeding on Old Man Island, lying about three miles southwest of Cutler. That year, the society provided the first protection for several species of Maine's sea birds, common eiders among them, by hiring wardens to protect nesting islands. Spring shooting was abolished and for several years it was illegal to shoot eiders during the regular hunting seasons. The enactment of the federal Migratory Bird Treaty in 1918 provided additional conservation regulations and by the late 1930s Maine's breeding population of eiders was recovering steadily. A survey conducted in 1943 estimated the population exceeded 2,000 nesting pairs. Today, Maine's Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife estimates there are more than 30,000 pairs.
For the uninitiated, the singularity of that recovery cannot be appreciated without an explanation of the nesting habits, reproduction success, predation, and survival rates of common eiders.
Eider habits
Although the ducks will breed on forested islands, they prefer unforested locations where weeds, vegetation, and thickets of wild raspberry, rose, bayberry and such provide nesting cover. Depending on its size and available cover, an island may have a nesting population of eiders ranging from a dozen to more than 500 mated pairs.
Nesting usually begins in late April, when the paired ducks go ashore and the female selects the nest site. It formerly was believed female eiders didn't nest until 3 years of age. Recent studies, however, show that females nest in their second year. Males generally are 3 years old when they first mate.
Without question, an adult male common eider displaying nuptial plumage is one of North America's most handsome waterfowl. His dramatic black-and-white plumage accented with chartreuse cheek patches and bright yellow bill and legs are bold contrast to the conservative but purposeful beauty of the female's barred-umber feathering.
After preparing the nest site, the female begins laying her eggs. A clutch may consist of two to eight eggs, but the average is four. Only the female incubates the eggs, and once the 26- to 28-day process begins she rarely leaves the nest, usually only to drink. During the incubation period, females are sustained by stores of body fat and protein developed before nesting.
When incubation begins, male eiders leave the islands to congregate in flocks near offshore ledges and shoals. Soon afterward, they enter their summer molt, during which flight feathers are shed simultaneously. Consequently, the ducks are flightless for three to four weeks and must depend on their swimming and diving abilities for survival. Female eiders molt after the nesting season is completed.
Hatching success usually amounts to about 50 percent of a clutch. But because many ducklings are lost to predators, exposure or starvation in their first week of life, only a few survive to become fledged. Even in high-production years, only one duckling per mated pair of eiders may survive. The young usually are able to fly in about 60 days.
Considering the low survival rate of eider ducklings, the question is obvious: How did Maine's depleted population of eiders manage to recover? The answer lies in the longevity of adult eiders, which may live and breed for 20 years or more. In addition, their estimated annual survival rates vary from 80 to 90 percent. Low reproduction success is compensated by high adult survival.
Island trip
In late May, DIFW biologist Brad Allen, who provided the technical information for this story, invited me to accompany him on a survey of eider colonies nesting on Penobscot Bay islands. As we approached the first island, a dozen or more male eiders flew from the surrounding slate-gray sea. When we climbed to the top of the island and entered a sprawling cover of knee-high cow parsnip, a female eider immediately flushed and flew to the water.
Her nest contained four olive-color eggs partially covered with down. Hearing us approaching, the duck had hastily covered the eggs. When females leave nests of their own volition, the eggs are carefully covered to provide warmth and camouflage. In all, we found 15 eider nests containing clutches that averaged three eggs per nest. The island also was occupied by a colony of nesting herring gulls. We found six gull nests containing olive-color eggs speckled with brown.
Most of the female eiders flew into the water after flushing, but a few lit into brush and were captured, examined and released. Brad allowed the ducks had been on their nests about three weeks and it showed; prolonged fasting caused their breast bones to protrude. The 15 eider nests confirmed the biologist's observation that the number of male eiders seen around an island often indicated the number of nesting females.
As we left the height of the island, the gulls immediately began returning while the female eiders remained in the water. That provided the egg-addicted gulls a golden opportunity to raid the eiders' nests. Hovering over the island, the gulls communicated in guttural croaks while searching for unattended nests. Each nest, however, was carefully camouflaged with down, leaves and grasses after it was examined. That, combined with the thick cover, concealed the nests from the sharp-eyed predators.
You may know that gulls, particularly the great black-backed variety, are considered the primary predators of eiders' eggs and unfledged young. Again, the question is obvious: Why do eiders nest on islands occupied by breeding populations of gulls? The answer is another example of nature's intriguing weave of interactions.
Brad explained that eiders and gulls began nesting at about the same time. The gulls, he said, became highly aggressive and actually provided protection for eiders nesting nearby. If not for that, predation by transient and resident unmated gulls, along with crows and ravens, would be devastating.
But almost as quickly as the tide turns, that somewhat engaging aspect of eider-gull relationship changes to one of savagery. A clutch of eider eggs usually hatches simultaneously. This allows that when the ducklings' feathers are dry -- generally within 24 hours -- the female leads them to the water in one group. Here is where the life-and-death drama peaks: Unfledged and virtually unprotected as they leave the nest, the ducklings are attacked and devoured by gulls.
Instinctively, ducklings that make it into the water join other broods and therefore are protected by several females. Such groups are referred to as "creches" and remain intact until the ducklings are able to fly. In the interim, the ducklings' survival often depends on their innate diving and swimming abilities.
Human threat
Gull predation of eiders is a serious problem, but perhaps even more serious is the problem of controlling human disturbance of nesting eiders. Because of increasing interest in Maine's offshore islands as recreational sites, nesting colonies of common eiders are subjected to disturbance by picnickers, boaters, photographers, shell gatherers and sunbathers.
Brad explained that human disturbance during the hatching season usually resulted in female eiders' being driven from their nests and ducklings entering the water too soon. His concerns echo those of Howard Mendall, former leader of the Maine Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit, whose work in conserving and protecting Maine's breeding populations of eiders is widely known and respected.
In a paper written in 1968, Mendall prophesied the problem of human disturbance on nesting islands: "In the face of the increased coastal exploitation that we are almost certain to experience in the next few years, eiders and other colonial sea birds will not thrive without more adequate breeding ground safeguards."
Today, about 250 coastal islands are owned or controlled by state and federal agencies and conservation organizations. Among them are the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, The Nature Conservancy, National Audubon Society and Maine Audubon Society. Also, many privately owned islands are maintained to provide habitat for migratory sea birds.
Before we left the state-owned island, Brad posted a sign warning against trespassing between May 1 and July 15. Under skies layered with leaden clouds we then visited several other islands. One of them was so colonized with nesting eiders that the air was rank with their excrement. If the island were inhabited by sharp-nosed mammals -- raccoons, skunks, weasels -- they would have no trouble locating nests.
Like moats surrounding medieval castles, the sea surrounding nesting islands is a defense against invasion by mammalian predators. That protection, however, hasn't prevented diseases from reaching colonies of nesting eiders. In 1963, 1970 and 1974, epidemics of avian cholera spread through eiders nesting on several of Maine's midcoast islands. Since then, smaller outbreaks have occurred, the most significant in 1984.
Because the bacteria occurs in domestic chickens, the source of avian cholera was believed to be the poultry industry, which had processing plants on Penobscot Bay. Chicken parts, presumably carried from plant refuse and dumps by gulls, were found on islands where eiders had died from the disease. It was discovered later, however, that the bacteria also occurred in brackish island pools from which nesting eiders drank.
Also, it is believed that nesting densities contributed to the spread of avian cholera. Studies showed 90 percent of the diseased ducks were females, which as mentioned before, were weakened during incubation.
Last, an increasing gantlet of guns awaits Maine's eiders during hunting season. Because of reduced regular duck-hunting seasons (now 30 days overall) and a daily bag limit of three ducks, which may include only one black duck, interest in eider hunting is growing. The reasons are a 107-day hunting season -- Oct. 4 to Jan. 19 this year -- and a daily bag limit of seven eiders. Despite those liberal regulations, wildlife biologists report no evidence of excessive hunting pressure.
Here again, the ducks are protected by their harsh and unforgiving environment. During late fall and winter, the ranks of waterfowlers decline rapidly when temperatures drop, winds cut, and seas often are too rough for small boats.
The hardy eiders pay scant attention to Ol' Man Winter's temper tantrums. The ducks dive and feed on mussels, clams, periwinkles and other mollusks -- which are swallowed whole and ground in powerful gizzards -- while nor'easters turn white with rage and periods of bitter cold shroud islands and ledges with "sea smoke."
Without question, Maine's breeding population of common eiders can withstand nature's many adversities, but can the wonderfully wild sea ducks survive the tide of human disturbance again rising on offshore nesting islands? The answer is yes. But only if man, the predator who came close to eradicating them in the 1800s, realizes he is now the protector of the mile-long rafts that nowadays ride the gray swells surging along Maine's coast.

Full text: BROOKLIN -- As sure a sign of autumn as asters, a cluster of tall ships glided into Naskeag Harbor Tuesday as part of the seventh annual WoodenBoat Sail-In.
Hosted by the Maine Windjammer Association to honor the tradition of working sail, the event featured association vessels originating from Rockport, Rockland and Camden sailing into the WoodenBoat magazine waterfront for their last gathering of the season.
Describing sailing conditions as "perfect," WoodenBoat School director Rich Hilsinger said the small craft warning issued Tuesday did not apply to these big boats, which reveled in the 20-knot winds.
Several of the Maine cruising fleet vessels, which the Windjammer Association represents and promotes, were built in Maine, although others were constructed in the Northeast. Ranging in size from 64 to 132 feet on deck, the various vessels also represent more than a century of boatbuilding, with a few built as recently as 30 years ago.
The people who own and skipper these boats have helped to keep the working sail tradition alive. But they now haul primarily human cargo rather than goods and raw materials as was done in the past. The boats offer three- and six-day cruises with a sailing training option in exchange for a cruise fee.
The oldest of the three 19th-century windjammers admired by onlookers Tuesday was the Lewis R. French, a 64-foot coaster built in South Bristol in 1871. Owned by Captain Dan Pease, the boat attracts passengers wishing immersion in traditional sailing methods.
For Belfast-born Trish Broud, now of Wheaton, Md., the vessel offered both escape and education.
"I decided that this is my vacation and I was not going to wash dishes," said Broud, who instead is helping the vessel's crew with several aspects of sail handling as part of her week-long cruise.
With at least two ancestors who were Maine sea captains, Broud had hoped to set sail for her own adventure aboard a windjammer on her honeymoon 25 years ago. That didn't work out, but the couple made sure to book passage aboard the Lewis R. French as part of their 25th anniversary celebration.
Owner-captain Pease explained that the Lewis R. French strives in several ways to maintain historic authenticity. The boat has no motor and a wood cook stove. Pease's one nod to the times is a new no-smoking policy.
"We try to do everything the way it would have been done 120 years ago," said the boyish-looking Pease.
Unlike those windjammer captain-owners who had more conventional careers before getting into the cruising business, Pease always wanted to captain a windjammer, and acted accordingly by working on boats and in yards since his college days. Not that there was a maritime tradition in his family -- his father and grandfather were judges.
After selling a boat he built with a partner, Pease used his proceeds to obtain the French eight years ago. He still has a lot to learn, he said, and has suffered somewhat with the weak economy, but business gets better each year.
Asked whether he would consider building a windjammer for his cruises as others in the fleet have done, Pease wasn't interested.
"It might be nice to build a new boat, but you could never duplicate a 120-year-old boat," he said.
Other vessels in the fleet Tuesday included the Isaac H. Evans, a 65-foot schooner built in New Jersey in 1886 for oyster dredging, the three-masted ram schooner Victory Chimes, built in Delaware in 1900 and the 71-year-old East Boothbay-built Nathaniel Bowditch yacht, a familiar sight to racing enthusiasts.

Full text: ELLSWORTH -- On Thursday, Sept. 23, the city will be Capital for a Day and Gov. John R. McKernan has set a tight agenda for himself beginning with his arrival at 8:30 a.m. until he ends his day at 6 p.m.
One request the governor might view with interest will be from the Ellsworth Education Association. During a recent meeting with the Ellsworth School Committee's negotiating team, the EEA's head negotiator, Phil Sawyer, suggested that the two sides invite the governor to their next meeting.
The administrative team, led by School Committee member Tom MacDonald and Superintendent Bruce Sawyer, did not oppose the recommendation. The negotiations that are taking place in Ellsworth are unique in the county, if not the state, because the sessions are open to the public. Phil Sawyer said the governor had expressed an interest in such open sessions, and might like to attend.
The teachers and school committee remain at odds over wages and insurance contributions. The two sides plan to meet again on Sept. 23.
McKernan's press spokesman, Cory Tilley, said Monday the governor's schedule was tight, and he was uncertain if McKernan would be able to meet with the negotiating teams. He said as of Monday, neither the EEA or the administrative negotiators had written to invite the governor, but he said his initial reaction to the suggestion was that it was not appropriate for the governor to be involved. He said if a detailed written request were sent, the governor might view the issue differently.
"We are not closing the door. He would need to look at it to see what it entails," Tilley said.
Ellsworth is the 77th Maine community to be named Capital for a Day, an outreach program that enables the governor and top state officials to meet with local residents and hear their concerns and ideas.
"I am looking forward to meeting with the residents of Ellsworth. My Capital for a Day visits are helpful to me and my commissioners because we are able to get away from Augusta and into communities such as Ellsworth to get the input we need from working men and women throughout the state," McKernan said in a prepared statement.
Commissioners who will be in Ellsworth with McKernan are: Michael Aube, Department of Economic and Community Development; Dana Connors, Department of Transportation; Dean Marriott, Department of Environmental Protection; Leo Martin, Department of Education; Sawin Millett, Administrative and Financial Services; Charles Morrison, Department of Labor; Bernard Shaw, Department of Agriculture; Jane Sheehan, Department of Human Services; Jane Titcomb, Department of Professional and Financial Regulation; and Sherry Huber, Maine Waste Management Agency.
According to the schedule published by the governor's office, at 9:15 a.m. he will be part of an assembly at the Ellsworth High School. At 10 a.m. he will be at the Maine Coast Memorial Hospital, and at noon, the Ellsworth Area Chamber of Commerce will hold a luncheon for the governor at the Holiday Inn.
During the afternoon, the governor will meet with employees of the Maine Department of Human Services. At 2:50 p.m. he will visit the Union River Harbor Site, and at 3:15 p.m., he will visit the Maine Shellfish Co. At 3:55 p.m. the governor will take a walk down Main Street, and at 5 p.m. he will hold a town meeting at City Hall.

[Hans Huessey] said a motion has been filed in superior court requesting a stay in all proceedings pending review by the BEP. The plaintiffs in the suit, all abutting property owners to the transfer station, contend that the DEP granted a permit to Lamoine without the written approval of two of the property owners. The two landowners, Charles Reynolds Sr. and Charles Reynolds Jr., claim they never waived their rights to a 250-foot setback and that such waivers are required for a DEP permit.

Full text: LAMOINE -- Plaintiffs in a lawsuit pending against the town of Lamoine have asked for a hearing before the Board of Environmental Protection.
Hans Huessey, a Bangor attorney representing six Lamoine property owners in their suit against the town and the Department of Environmental Protection, confirmed Thursday that a request for a BEP hearing was made in recent days.
Huessey said he expected to hear within two weeks whether the BEP will grant the hearing to consider the plaintiffs' contention that a DEP permit given the town to construct a transfer station should be revoked.
As part of the lawsuit filed in Hancock County Superior Court on July 1, the property owners are seeking a revocation of the DEP permit. Huessey said a motion has been filed in superior court requesting a stay in all proceedings pending review by the BEP.
The town has filed an objection to that request, but the court has not yet ruled on the objection.
Construction of the transfer station was completed this summer, and the facility opened for business in August.
The plaintiffs in the suit, all abutting property owners to the transfer station, contend that the DEP granted a permit to Lamoine without the written approval of two of the property owners. The two landowners, Charles Reynolds Sr. and Charles Reynolds Jr., claim they never waived their rights to a 250-foot setback and that such waivers are required for a DEP permit.
Other landowners who are part of the lawsuit seek a revocation of the setback waivers they signed. They contend that they were misled by one or more Lamoine selectmen about the location of affordable and/or available sites for the transfer station. Further, they noted that they would not have signed the setback waivers if they had known the town had other options for the location of the facility.
The abutters claim they have suffered "substantial and potentially irreparable harm ... (as the) transfer station will cause them to suffer noxious odors, increased traffic, noise and diminishment of their enjoyment of their property."
According to Stu Marckoon, administrative assistant in Lamoine, no written complaints about noise or traffic have been forwarded to his office since the transfer station opened.
Two local shellfish dealers are footing the bills for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Dean Smith and Mike Briggs have voiced their opposition to the location of the transfer station since being informed the town would no longer accept their commercial waste once the landfill closed. They claimed that the 29-acre, town-owned property, a portion of which contains the now-abandoned dump, was a more appropriate location for a transfer station.
At present, the two business owners and Coastal Recycling are making a proposal to town selectmen to operate a shellfish compost at the site of the former landfill.
Marckoon said the town has spent about $3,500 in the past three months on attorney's fees related to the lawsuit.

Board to decide on composting hearing

Abstract: Questions about the proposal, spelled out in some detail by Coastal Recycling Executive Director Nina Silvestrone, remain for the town's selectmen. Stu Marckoon, administrative assistant in [Lamoine], listed those questions in a letter to Silvestrone shortly after her presentation to selectmen last week. Marckoon said selectmen want answers in writing prior to setting a public hearing on the proposal for Lamoine residents. Coastal Recycling's board of directors has also directed Silvestrone to pursue alternative sites for a shellfish composting operation if Lamoine rejects the proposal. Marckoon made note of the business owners' financial backing of the lawsuit in his letter to Silvestrone about the composting proposal. Referring to a conversation with the town's attorney, Marckoon said the attorney "feels that if the litigation involving the transfer station were cleared up, that would be a plus in locating this experiment at the landfill."

Full text: LAMOINE -- Lamoine selectmen are expected to decide next Wednesday if and when to schedule a public hearing about a proposal to place a shellfish composting operation at the town's landfill. Selectmen will meet at 6 p.m. at the town office.
The proposal, which was formally brought to Lamoine selectmen on Sept. 1 by Coastal Recycling, and Lamoine shellfish dealers Blue Ribbon Seafoods Inc. and H.A. Boynton Shellfish Co., would be a pilot project with operating costs covered by the two companies.
Coastal Recycling plans to request research and development funds from Maine Waste Management Agency to cover the costs of collecting, shredding and baling paper from selected businesses and schools to mix with the shellfish waste. Coastal Recycling would also work to distribute or market the finished compost.
Questions about the proposal, spelled out in some detail by Coastal Recycling Executive Director Nina Silvestrone, remain for the town's selectmen. Stu Marckoon, administrative assistant in Lamoine, listed those questions in a letter to Silvestrone shortly after her presentation to selectmen last week. Marckoon said selectmen want answers in writing prior to setting a public hearing on the proposal for Lamoine residents.
In response, Silvestrone said the major aspects of the project have been answered in the proposal. Other specifics, she said, would more appropriately be answered in any upcoming lease agreement.
Further, Silvestrone stated in her letter to Marckoon this week that any lease agreement would be premature "as the residents of the town of Lamoine have not been allowed the opportunity to consider hosting this project."
Silvestrone said Thursday that her board of directors has approved the project. The MWMA has also issued a letter welcoming a proposal for funding for the demonstration project. Brian Kavanah, from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, said in late August that the Lamoine landfill site "could be permitted" for the composting project if certain operating conditions were met.
Coastal Recycling's board of directors has also directed Silvestrone to pursue alternative sites for a shellfish composting operation if Lamoine rejects the proposal.
Although the composting proposal is not directly tied to a lawsuit by abutting landowners in Lamoine, there is a relationship between the two, Marckoon said.
The lawsuit, which contends that the DEP permit for the location of the transfer station should be revoked, is being financed by the two shellfish dealers.
According to shellfish dealer Dean Smith in an interview this summer, he and Mike Briggs of Blue Ribbon Seafood had considered pursuing some legal action against the town when informed that their shellfish waste would not be accepted at the new transfer station. However, two attorneys advised the shellfish dealers that any lawsuit questioning the town's right to deny space to a commercial entity could prove extremely costly and protracted.
Smith said in July that he and Briggs were advised they couldn't stop the transfer station "and that the better tack would be to draw the abutters into the picture."
Marckoon made note of the business owners' financial backing of the lawsuit in his letter to Silvestrone about the composting proposal. Referring to a conversation with the town's attorney, Marckoon said the attorney "feels that if the litigation involving the transfer station were cleared up, that would be a plus in locating this experiment at the landfill."
Marckoon said the selectmen question what would happen if the town were forced to move the transfer station to the landfill site as a result of the lawsuit. He said there is some concern about whether the operators of the composting project would then move that site elsewhere.
According to Silvestrone, the DEP has indicated that more than one spot at the landfill property could be approved for the location of a composting operation.

Abstract: The scam was revealed the day after it happened by an anonymous tipster who called himself "Deep Homard" -- French for lobster -- who took credit for engineering it on Look's behalf. The tipster, however, may have escaped the long claw of the law. No other names appeared on the indictment list in connection with the scam, and [R. Christopher Almy] would not elaborate.

Full text: A lobster dealer's attempt to settle a debt with a private sting operation six weeks ago has backfired, resulting in criminal charges against him.
Bert Sidney Look, 50, of Jonesport, owner of O.W. & B.S. Look Co. Inc., was indicted Tuesday for theft by deception for allegedly scamming "more than $20,000 out of various lobster dealers," according to Penobscot County District Attorney R. Christopher Almy. It is a Class B offense with a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
On July 24, a Port Clyde shellfish wholesaler who supposedly owed Look money was lured to the parking lot of Dysart's truck stop near the Hampden-Hermon town line along with a truckload of lobsters under the pretense that he would be supplying them for a lobster bake being given by Bangor author Stephen King.
Instead, the shellfish -- reportedly 7,000 pounds in 78 crates -- were unloaded into another vehicle while the broker, John Kostandin, was at a Bangor restaurant where he believed he would meet King.
The lobster sting has received wide publicity in Boston, where at least one newspaper gave it Page One play right after it happened and has tracked every subsequent development.
Almy said the sting hurt not just Kostandin, but the lobstermen who lost money because of it as well.
"He stuck it to a lot of honest lobster people down in Port Clyde," said Almy.
The scam was revealed the day after it happened by an anonymous tipster who called himself "Deep Homard" -- French for lobster -- who took credit for engineering it on Look's behalf. The tipster, however, may have escaped the long claw of the law. No other names appeared on the indictment list in connection with the scam, and Almy would not elaborate.

Abstract: It is not only the plant, she said, but also the truck traffic. "They don't put deodorizers on the trucks. That might solve a little bit of the problem. When we smell it, it seems to us the odor is coming from where they load and unload the trailers. The doors are open while the truck is in." Some of the loads coming to the plant, she said, carry shellfish. "That is pretty rank. The plant problems, she believes, could be solved if they installed a double door system, so the trucks had to go through one set of doors before the second set to the plant was opened. In answer to [Sue Kenney]'s complaint, Bob Field a spokesman of the PERC plant said, "We have received our share of complaints from the Kenneys, and others have complained about the odor. The major contributors to the odor are the trucks coming and going from the facility. We have had odor complaints five miles from the facility, but when we checked, those complaints correspond with trucks going by.

Full text: ORRINGTON -- Sue Kenney and her husband Randy have a problem with the Penobscot Energy Recovery Plant. It stinks.
Orrington residents are not unique. When temperatures rise Hampden residents complain of Sawyer's landfill operation. Brewer residents complain of sludge and fertilizer on fields. And up until it was closed, residents in Brewer complained of the city landfill odors. Where ever there is a dump, a transfer station, or even a sewage treatment plant, summer heat can intesify the problem.
The PERC plant, she said, has not resolved the problems regarding odor. She said she has called the plant and they have done nothing. She and her husband have gone down to the plant to inspect the site and found the doors to the plant open when they are loading garbage.
"They need a double door system like MERC (the Maine Environmental Recovery Co. in Biddeford)," she said. "It is frustrating. We can't have weekend cookouts. It is a major problem. It ruins the neighborhood."
It is not only the plant, she said, but also the truck traffic. "They don't put deodorizers on the trucks. That might solve a little bit of the problem. When we smell it, it seems to us the odor is coming from where they load and unload the trailers. The doors are open while the truck is in." Some of the loads coming to the plant, she said, carry shellfish. "That is pretty rank. The plant problems, she believes, could be solved if they installed a double door system, so the trucks had to go through one set of doors before the second set to the plant was opened.
Kenney said there is a citizens' committee to handle complaints and concerns of that nature, but that hasn't met for some time. "Nothing was really resolved," she said. "They met with people because they do want to have good relations with the people around them."
Although the plant does not smell all the time, she said, it shoiuldn't smell at all. "I call every weekend, two or three times. If you are having a party or a gathering it can be embarrassing. You're eating lunch and then you smell that smell."
She said plant officials will say that the plant is a negative pressure system and it shouldn't be smelling. "It does smell and they all know it does smell." She said they have money to do all sorts of things and she would like them put some of that money into a double door system.
In answer to Kenney's complaint, Bob Field a spokesman of the PERC plant said, "We have received our share of complaints from the Kenneys, and others have complained about the odor. The major contributors to the odor are the trucks coming and going from the facility. We have had odor complaints five miles from the facility, but when we checked, those complaints correspond with trucks going by.
"We have looked at the double door system, but it won't do anything with trucks waiting to be unloaded." He said they see the trucks as the major source of odor. "It is true when the doors are open, some odor escapes, but it is intermittent when the doors are opened or closed. Double doors would probably take care of about 10 percent of the problem."

Full text: PHIPPSBURG -- Maine's Stone Age residents were peaceable folks who ate lots of shellfish, rarely got cavities and became proficient in making tools.
And, like modern-day Mainers, they also recognized the value of oceanfront property on Casco Bay.
Two researchers who are leading a series of archaeological excavations on Casco Bay say they hope to be the first to map out the history of humans and their environment all the way back to the Ice Age.
Overlooking the rich marine basin where the New Meadows River empties into the Atlantic, archaeologist Nathan Hamilton surveyed the final dig of the summer-long project with the University of Southern Maine.
"Walk up to the top of that hill and get a look at the landscape," Hamilton said. "You're in close proximity to fresh water, it's a well-drained landscape, there's a nice place to dock your boat and there's an abundance of good food and good marine resources."
That's the way it has been since the start of the Holocene era, when glaciers receded north, creating a bountiful coastline of sheltered inlets, rocky beaches and rich river basins.
This single site, said Hamilton, holds clues that tell the story of humans and their bay all the way back to the Ice Age.
Geographer Matthew Bampton, Hamilton's partner on the project, is particularly intrigued by the prospect of a thriving prehistoric fish processing industry along the bay.
Bampton said there is evidence in some layers of dirt, especially those with a sunny southern exposure, that the guts and entrails of tons of fish were dumped there.
It's a sign, he said, that those spots might have been used to dry and preserve abundant catches to eat during leaner times.
"If we can look at how people used the environment in the past and how they use it now, we might be able to do something about declining fish stocks," Bampton said.
On this project alone, students have found more than 50 shell "middens," layers in the soil that hold such an abundance of clam shells they are almost certainly the remains of a prehistoric dump.
Higher up the sliver of land, another terraced hole reveals clues of man from a more recent age. Around 1720, white settlers arrived here and built the earliest known house in the river basin.
Among the 8,000 artifacts excavated from the house are pieces of burnt flint. Before Europeans settled Casco Bay, Bampton noted, there is almost no evidence of warfare in the region.

Abstract: "They were using a culture technique that was, at best, allowing a 5 percent survival of larvae to the first bottom stage, and that was just not acceptable," said [Brian Beal]. "The first thing I did was to closely examine the larvae of the European lobster using a microscope. Seeing that it looked remarkably similar to ours, Homarus americanus, I devised a plan that essentially copied the system that aquaculture specialist Sam Chapman and I had worked on for several years at Cutler. After several trials, they are now consistently acheiving survival rates of 50 percent and I have recently learned that researchers from Italy and England have adopted this culture system."

Full text: MACHIAS -- Two top officials from the republic of Ireland, representing an Irish- or Gaelic-speaking economic development agency known as Udaras na Gaeltachta, recently traveled to Washington County to tour local aquaculture sites.
Ruan O'Bric and Sean O'Naechtnan accompanied Brian Beal, assistant professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, to sites on Beals Island, Cutler, Eastport and Lubec.
Ireland is similar in geographic size to Maine and relies heavily on fishing and creating products from its fisheries. Since the early 1980s, salmon and shellfish aquaculture in Ireland has become an important business, especially on the west coast where there are large pockets of traditional culture and language.
Ireland was once a major producer of European lobster, Homarus gammarus, but recently that industry has fallen on hard times due primarily to the lack of an effective management program for the species. Several groups in Ireland are now staging an effort to culture baby lobsters to enhance existing, but dwindling, stocks.
Professor Beal was invited in November 1992 to present a paper at an aquaculture symposium in Galway that focused on the Cutler Marine Hatchery effort. He accompanied lobster biologist Robert Bayer and two graduate students from the University of Maine. During their five-day visit, they toured various fish and shellfish culture facilities and a shellfish research laboratory where larval and juvenile lobsters are being raised.
Beal was invited again to Ireland in March of this year for three weeks to assist researchers in devising better culture systems that would result in high lobster survival through their delicate planktonic stage.
"They were using a culture technique that was, at best, allowing a 5 percent survival of larvae to the first bottom stage, and that was just not acceptable," said Beal. "The first thing I did was to closely examine the larvae of the European lobster using a microscope. Seeing that it looked remarkably similar to ours, Homarus americanus, I devised a plan that essentially copied the system that aquaculture specialist Sam Chapman and I had worked on for several years at Cutler. After several trials, they are now consistently acheiving survival rates of 50 percent and I have recently learned that researchers from Italy and England have adopted this culture system."
While in Washington County, the economic development officials visited the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery and Cutler Marine Hatchery. "We wanted to get a sense of the size of those two programs that have received considerable attention in Ireland," said agency executive director O'Bric.

Abstract: According to a notice issued Thursday by Sam Jones, administrative officer for DMR Commissioner William Brennan, the closure was ordered after tests conducted on shellfish samples collected in the affected area revealed "dangerous levels" of paralytic shellfish poison, also known as "red tide."

Full text: LUBEC -- The Department of Marine Resources has announced the immediate closure of waters between Moose Cove in Trescott and the Canadian border to the harvesting of shellfish.
According to a notice issued Thursday by Sam Jones, administrative officer for DMR Commissioner William Brennan, the closure was ordered after tests conducted on shellfish samples collected in the affected area revealed "dangerous levels" of paralytic shellfish poison, also known as "red tide."
The closure affects the harvesting of clams, oysters, carnivorous whelks and snails from the outer shores, flats and waters between Moose Cove and the Canadian border.
Soft shell clams, however, may still be harvested in the area northwest of a line drawn from Comstock Point in North Lubec, northeasterly to Shackford Head in Eastport and includes Cobscook Bay, South Bay, Straight Bay, Whiting Bay and Sipp Bay.
"The Cobscook Bay area is excepted from this closure," Jones said, "because tests show that the harvest of soft shell clams there can be permitted without threat to the public health."
Fishermen have been prohibited from harvesting mussels in the affected area since July 26, 1991. Additionally, the area has been closed to taking quahogs since July 13 of this year.

Abstract: Festival officials said the combination of perfect weather, national publicity from "Good Morning America" and the visit of an expected 150 boats from the New York Yacht Club brought record crowds to the festival grounds on Thursday and Friday. The crew from the mammoth festival visitor, USS Thomas S. Gates, also swelled the crowd. On Friday, Christian got a T-shirt from local weathermen Peter Bouchard and Lou McNally from Maine ABC affiliates, then pronounced the weather "gorgeous" and did a lobster segment (Christian hates shellfish) with cookbook author Susan Herman Loomis. Loomis credited Jess's Market for cooking the lobster and Patricia Radcliffe for preparing the chowder. She also plugged the Maine potato industry (an "earthier taste" than Idahos) along with the blueberry industry. The Schooner Wendameen got some free air time and the band "Old Gray Goose" performed briefly at the end of the two hour show.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- In one of the most successful days the Maine Lobster Festival has ever had in its 46 years, Sherrie Lee Leino, 18, of Rockland was crowned Maine Sea Goddess in front of the usual capacity crowds at the public landing on Friday.
The runner-up was Bobbi Jean Emery, 17, of Rockport.
Leino is the daughter of James and Sandra Leino and plans to attend Westbrook College and major in dental hygiene. She was sponsored by Little Caesar's Pizza, Fuller Cadillac, Dean's Flower Shop and Hair Dynamics. Emery was sponsored by the Emery Construction of Warren and plans to attend the University of Southern Maine, majoring in social work.
Festival officials said the combination of perfect weather, national publicity from "Good Morning America" and the visit of an expected 150 boats from the New York Yacht Club brought record crowds to the festival grounds on Thursday and Friday. The crew from the mammoth festival visitor, USS Thomas S. Gates, also swelled the crowd.
Director James Brickel, volunteering at the lobster feeding line, said the festival sold 2,500 pounds of lobster on Thursday, compared to about 750 pounds on the Thursday of last year's festival. "We are right on track. We had to go back three times to get more lobsters from Atwood's. We couldn't believe it." On Friday about 1,300 pounds had been sold by 2 p.m. with at least 100 people in the waiting line.
The only cloud on the horizon was rainy weather scheduled for Saturday's festival parade.
At the public landing, Assistant Harbormaster Jeff Edwards said about 60 of the expected 150 boats from the yacht club had arrived by 2 p.m. Friday with the full complement expected by sundown. About 25 of the boats will use available mooring space but the rest will drop anchor in Rockland's expansive harbor. "We have plenty of room for all of them," Edwards said.
The day's events began at 7 a.m. when ABC-TV weatherman shouted "Good Morning, America" from the roof of the waterfront Black Pearl Restaurant. Unfortunately the broadcast lost its satellite feed at just that moment and the picture went off the air. "Things are rocky in Rockland," said New York hostess Joan Lunden to the national television audience.
But the problems got ironed out soon enough to give the festival a national boost, the first since Real People filmed a segment of the now-defunct sardine packing contest in 1979. Former sardine packing champ Rita Willey once packed sardines with TV host Johnny Carson, but that was in 1970.
On Friday, Christian got a T-shirt from local weathermen Peter Bouchard and Lou McNally from Maine ABC affiliates, then pronounced the weather "gorgeous" and did a lobster segment (Christian hates shellfish) with cookbook author Susan Herman Loomis. Loomis credited Jess's Market for cooking the lobster and Patricia Radcliffe for preparing the chowder. She also plugged the Maine potato industry (an "earthier taste" than Idahos) along with the blueberry industry. The Schooner Wendameen got some free air time and the band "Old Gray Goose" performed briefly at the end of the two hour show.
The visit was not without controversy.
Volunteers who cranked up the "World's Largest Lobster Cooker" at 6:30 a.m. for the television show were a little steamed that the show never used the cooker, then used a lobster cooked by Jess's Market ... at the Maine Lobster Festival.
But Black Pearl Manager Peter Larsen said he was "thrilled" with the free national publicity "as long as nobody fell off the roof."

Shellfish composting on agenda at Lamoine Coastal Recycling proposal to be examined

Abstract: The compost site, if established at the now closed landfill property, would serve only the two shellfish dealers in [Lamoine]. Mixed paper, collected by Coastal Recycling from its member towns, would be shredded to compost with the shellfish waste. Mixed paper would include such items as cereal boxes and toilet tissue tubes, paper products not now recycled in the towns. Brian Kavanah, from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, has said the landfill site in Lamoine could be used for composting if certain conditions could be met. Those conditions include covering the pile with tarps, removing excessive moisture, limiting the amount of shellfish waste placed there each year, grinding the shells before delivery to the site, and certain storage conditions. Kavanah, along with [Nina Silvestrone], [Stu Marckoon] and [Mike Briggs], visited the Lamoine property and property in Hancock in recent days. The visits indicated the Lamoine property was the more appropriate spot for a composting pilot project, Marckoon said.

Full text: LAMOINE -- Lamoine selectmen are expected to consider by the end of this month a proposal from Coastal Recycling to establish a shellfish composting site at the old landfill.
Stu Marckoon, administrative assistant in Lamoine, said Thursday that the three selectmen indicated this week that they are "interested in seeing what will be proposed."
If specific concerns of the selectmen can be addressed and answered in the proposal, Marckoon said, townspeople then will be asked to vote on the project at a special town meeting.
The compost site, if established at the now closed landfill property, would serve only the two shellfish dealers in Lamoine. Mixed paper, collected by Coastal Recycling from its member towns, would be shredded to compost with the shellfish waste. Mixed paper would include such items as cereal boxes and toilet tissue tubes, paper products not now recycled in the towns.
As explained by Nina Silvestrone, executive director of Coastal Recycling, the compost heap could be a pilot project for the organization. The two shellfish dealers, Mike Briggs and Dean Smith, have agreed to underwrite the project by providing the equipment, labor, operation and start-up costs such as site development, Silvestrone said in an earlier interview.
Marckoon said the town should not incur any costs with the compost project, only that it would be placed on town-owned property.
The two shellfish dealers were informed last year that they would not be able to dump their shellfish waste at the town's new transfer station when the dump was closed. The two dealers stopped short of bringing legal action against the town in protest of that decision, but indicated months ago they thought the town should either provide a spot for composting the waste or room for temporary storage of the shellfish.
Brian Kavanah, from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, has said the landfill site in Lamoine could be used for composting if certain conditions could be met. Those conditions include covering the pile with tarps, removing excessive moisture, limiting the amount of shellfish waste placed there each year, grinding the shells before delivery to the site, and certain storage conditions.
Kavanah, along with Silvestrone, Marckoon and Briggs, visited the Lamoine property and property in Hancock in recent days. The visits indicated the Lamoine property was the more appropriate spot for a composting pilot project, Marckoon said.
The town's new transfer station opens at 8 a.m. Friday, Aug. 6, despite a lawsuit by six abutting property owners. Those neighbors called for a halt to construction of the station, claiming they were misled by selectmen who, they say, informed them no other site was available and-or affordable.
The abutters contend they would never have signed setback waivers for the station if they had not been misinformed. Two of the property owners say they were never contacted and have not waived their rights to a 250-foot setback.
The town and the DEP have been named as defendants in the lawsuit. The lawsuit calls on the DEP to revoke the permit granted for the station.
Marckoon said the lawsuit has not yet been scheduled for its day in court. He hoped that once the transfer station is open the "neighbors' concerns will be alleviated."

Abstract: The target, John Kostandin, who lives in Port Clyde, brought a truckload of lobsters north to a spot near Dysart's truck stop Saturday night, having been told that he was supplying a lobster bake hosted by Bangor author Stephen King. From there, he was diverted to a restaurant where he was led to believe he would meet the author, who in reality had nothing to do with the deal. It has been anything but quiet since Sunday, when an anonymous tipster who calls himself "Deep Homard," appropriating the French word for lobster, began alerting the media about the sting and claiming credit for engineering it on behalf of the Look company. It quickly became a hot, er, tomalley in the news media, even making the front page of Tuesday morning's Boston Herald.

Full text: The beneficiary of a private sting operation last weekend at a truck stop near the Hampden-Hermon town line is less than pleased with the publicity it's received.
The Saturday night scam -- call it The Lobster Trap -- targeted a man said to owe about $30,000 to O.W. & B.S. Look Co. Inc. of Jonesport, a producer and supplier of shellfish.
The target, John Kostandin, who lives in Port Clyde, brought a truckload of lobsters north to a spot near Dysart's truck stop Saturday night, having been told that he was supplying a lobster bake hosted by Bangor author Stephen King. From there, he was diverted to a restaurant where he was led to believe he would meet the author, who in reality had nothing to do with the deal.
Meanwhile, back at Dysart's, the lobsters -- 7,000 pounds in 78 crates -- were unloaded over the objection of the truck driver and spirited away.
When Kostandin realized what had happened, he notified the Penobscot County Sheriff's Department, which is investigating whether any crimes were committed. That determination won't come until later in the week, according to Sgt. Fred Clarke. The value of the lobsters is a matter of some dispute, with estimates ranging from $20,000 to $40,000.
"We do not intend to mar the reputation of anyone, nor do we want to portray ourselves as some sort of modern-day hero," reads a statement the Look company released Tuesday. "We only wish to say that what we had hoped would be a quiet settlement of accounts, handled between our company and the debtor company, has been blown way out of proportion and has gotten way out of hand."
"As far as we are concerned, the account has been settled and closed," it stated.
But it has been anything but quiet since Sunday, when an anonymous tipster who calls himself "Deep Homard," appropriating the French word for lobster, began alerting the media about the sting and claiming credit for engineering it on behalf of the Look company. It quickly became a hot, er, tomalley in the news media, even making the front page of Tuesday morning's Boston Herald.
The faxed release, which the company said will be its only public comment on the matter, maintains that the target of the sting had owed Look money for 10 months. The company claims to have papers to back up that claim, but will not make them public. The sting, according to Look, followed repeated unsuccessful attempts by Look and professional collection agencies to settle the debt.
"Taking this into consideration, we did the only thing we felt we could do," the company said in its statement.
They hired "Homard" because he "is a comedian of sorts and has a great mind for scheming," according to the statement, and company owner Sid Look has known him for about three years.
"We have not, however, authorized any statement by `Mr. Homard' in connection with this matter or on behalf of this company," the statement reads.
So now it appears that "Deep Homard" is in deep -- what's French for doo-doo? -- with Look. Or at least in a lobster stew.

Full text: ELLSWORTH -- Hoping to stop what at worst looks like wholesale squandering of potentially valuable demolition debris, two usually separate municipal units will unite to tackle the issue.
The city's Solid Waste and Recycling committees will meet jointly for the first time at 7 p.m. Wednesday, July 28, at Ellsworth City Hall. The purpose is to discuss how to milk some value from castoff construction materials that are costly to have hauled away.
Stephen Beathem, chairman of the Recycling Committee, said the meeting could become freewheeling with participants welcome to take potshots at a preliminary proposal for dealing with debris at the city's transfer station.
Disposal of demolition debris currently costs as much as $70 per ton. Beathem said he is unaware of any significant progress made by proponents of a debris disposal site proposed for Township 8.
The Ellsworth committees hope to steer the city closer to the success rates some other towns have achieved in cutting the overall volume and cost of waste disposal.
Beathem gave the local recycling center generally good reviews, yet qualified his praise.
Beathem estimated that the facility was getting 15 to 20 percent of the waste stream. "That's not good," he said, "but it's far better than it was 15 months ago. We weren't getting anything then."
Recycling Committee member Carolyn "Cookie" Patten, considered a founder of the facility, said its greatest success had been the high volume of cardboard recycled by local businesses. Demolition debris presents a major challenge, she said, and may promise a lode of opportunity to reclaim some of recycling's costs.
The recycling center is poorly equipped to store or process demolition debris, Patten said. The two small bins earmarked for debris aren't big enough to handle the rubble from even one downed single-family residence.
Some of the material could be sorted and chipped or otherwise processed instead of being sent off for disposal, Patten said. As things now stand, the materials that fall to the wrecker's ball present the contractor who must dispose of them the biggest headache of all.
Patten said other issues facing the Recycling Committee include the need for more volunteers at the center. Hancock County Sheriff William Clark has expressed some interest in having jail inmates volunteer services there.
Recyclers also hope eventually to develop municipal composting. Waste generated from local blueberry and shellfish businesses is just that, Patten said -- wasted material that could become a resource if it were composted.
For now, an extensive composting program may be among the visions the city can little afford.
"We're looking at the most reasonable thing to do from the standpoint of money and ecology and everything else," Beathem said.

Full text: A Lamoine seafood-processing company has been ordered to pay a total of $18,000 to 45 employees for violations of federal wage and hour laws.
The payments will settle a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Labor in February against Sonja Beal Inc., which operates as M.C. Briggs Shellfish Co., and Bryan C. Briggs, its president.
Briggs could not be reached for comment Friday. The suit accused the seafood company of paying employees less than the minimum wage, neglecting to pay time-and-a-half for overtime, and failing to keep adequate records of employees' wages and hours. The court order was signed by Judge Morton Brody at U.S. District Court in Bangor. Brody also prohibited the seafood company from future violations of federal labor law.

Abstract: [Lamoine] Selectman Dick Davis said Thursday he and Selectman Arthur Alley will visit a shellfish composting facility in Gouldsboro this weekend. Of greatest concern to the selectmen, Davis indicated, is whether offensive shellfish odors can be controlled if a composting heap is placed at one edge of the Lamoine landfill. Increasing controversy has accompanied the construction of Lamoine's transfer station on Route 184, a facility that has no room for the storage or composting of the shellfish waste generated by two companies in Lamoine. The town must stop using its landfill, located on 29 acres off Route 184 and down the road from the transfer station, by July 31. Nina Silvestrone, executive director of Coastal Recycling, said Thursday her organization had interest in coordinating a pilot project for composting at the Lamoine site. In fact, she added, both [Dean Smith] and [Mike Briggs] have maintained an avid interest in learning about composting over the past year, indicating they could oversee any composting operation.

Full text: LAMOINE -- A suggestion to place a composting site at the town's landfill property is apparently up for reconsideration.
Lamoine Selectman Dick Davis said Thursday he and Selectman Arthur Alley will visit a shellfish composting facility in Gouldsboro this weekend. Of greatest concern to the selectmen, Davis indicated, is whether offensive shellfish odors can be controlled if a composting heap is placed at one edge of the Lamoine landfill.
Increasing controversy has accompanied the construction of Lamoine's transfer station on Route 184, a facility that has no room for the storage or composting of the shellfish waste generated by two companies in Lamoine. The town must stop using its landfill, located on 29 acres off Route 184 and down the road from the transfer station, by July 31.
Town selectmen decided to place the transfer station at the Route 184 location, contending it was the least expensive and most expedient alternative for the town. A jobs-bond grant helped finance the building that is nearing completion on the site, which is less than one acre.
Administrative Assistant Stu Marckoon explained in an earlier interview that trying to place a transfer station on the 29-acre landfill site would have required extensive and expensive engineering costs.
Shellfish dealers Dean Smith and Mike Briggs over the past year have protested the chosen site. According to Smith, the two men had asked the selectmen last spring to consider placing a composting site at the old landfill to handle the shellfish waste, but their suggestion was rebuffed. "We didn't propose it in a formal way (in writing)," Smith said Thursday, "but we got the feeling there was no use to after meeting with the selectmen."
Marckoon said Thursday the selectmen told Smith this week to submit a formal proposal for composting. "It's up to them to propose something ... and then we'll consider it."
Davis said there was apparently room at the landfill for composting and that the town did, in fact, know one outer boundary of the garbage at the dump. He said that if composting shellfish waste there seems a good alternative, selectmen would need to take the issue to a special town meeting. He indicated the town would need to sell the gravel off a portion of the land, and use those funds to help pay for the operation.
A representative from the Department of Environmental Protection has indicated that the landfill site could be used for composting without expensive engineering or licensing. In a letter dated July 2, 1993, Brian Kavanah from the department's Division of Solid Waste Facilities Regulations in Bangor said the location looked good "from an odor standpoint" as long as any shellfish wastes were covered by a water-repellent tarp.
Other regulations that might be imposed on the site, according to Kavanah, would include grinding the shells before placement there and getting rid of excess liquid.
Nina Silvestrone, executive director of Coastal Recycling, said Thursday her organization had interest in coordinating a pilot project for composting at the Lamoine site. In fact, she added, both Smith and Briggs have maintained an avid interest in learning about composting over the past year, indicating they could oversee any composting operation.
Silvestrone said Coastal Recycling viewed such a pilot project as a "golden opportunity," particularly since mixed paper could be shredded to compost with the shellfish waste. That mixed paper -- such as cereal boxes and toilet tissue tubes -- is presently not recycled and towns pay to ship such waste to PERC.
Any compost generated could be marketed by Coastal Recycling. The organization could also provide a shredder for the paper. Silvestrone said no other member towns in Coastal Recycling had the town-owned property that Lamoine has that is suitable for composting.
Marckoon said he had not yet told selectmen about Coastal Recycling's interest in a pilot project located in Lamoine. "I don't have anything concrete to propose yet," he said.
Another unresolved controversy surrounding the placement of the transfer station is one involving six abutting property owners. Those residents are currently involved in a lawsuit against the town and DEP, seeking to halt construction of the station and calling for compensation for non-economic injuries. The abutters are claiming they were misled by selectmen who, they say, informed them no other site was available and/or affordable for the transfer station.
They have contended they would never have signed setback waivers for the station if they had not been misinformed. Two of the property owners say they were never contacted and have not waived their rights to a 250-foot setback.

Rifle match held at rebuilt shooting range

Abstract: [John Chandler] was largely responsible for the engineering of the expansion at Oyster River, said Arthur Jura, range owner. The range was lengthened to a maximum of 600 yards, to match the shooting ranges found at Camp Perry, Ohio, where national matches are held each year. The Oyster River Range has been in operation since 1972, when Jura moved his school photography business and a budding gun shop from Rockland to Warren. He and a shooting friend, Dick Freeman of Rockland, found 67 acres of undeveloped land on Route 90. Since then, the range has been home to nearly every type of formal and informal shooting sport, indoor and outdoor, including a popular rifle and pistol cast-bullet tournament held each spring.

Full text: WARREN -- The Oyster River Range's newly expanded rifle range got a christening earlier this summer when 27 Maine high-power rifle shooters spent 10 hours on a boiling-hot day shooting the state championship match and Department of Civilian Marksmanship-sanctioned "leg match."
It was the first time since 1984 that such a match had been held at Oyster River Range, which reopened this June with its new 600-yard course after nine years of rebuilding.
The new Maine Rifle Champion is John Chandler of Auburn, who fired a .308-caliber service rifle and scored 476 of a possible 500 points. Chandler is a former Maine National Guard major and marksmanship coordinator and is a member of the Army Reserve. He is a bureau supervisor for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection in Augusta.
Chandler was largely responsible for the engineering of the expansion at Oyster River, said Arthur Jura, range owner. The range was lengthened to a maximum of 600 yards, to match the shooting ranges found at Camp Perry, Ohio, where national matches are held each year.
With the help of National Guard heavy equipment and engineers, 14,000 cubic yards of earth were moved to build the berm at the end of the range, including a target pit area with new target carriers. The backstop formed by the earthen berm is 175 feet wide and 35 feet high.
The long shooting day was a product of having each rifleman fire 50 rounds for the state match and 50 for the leg match. When no target-setters were available for the day's shoot, the shooters divided into three strings, each taking turns shooting, scoring and handling targets in the "pits."
The style of competition found at Oyster River Range is one of the older shooting disciplines, Jura explained, and requires concentration, endurance and training. Three shooting positions are used: off-hand (standing) at 200 yards; sitting at 200 yards; prone, rapid-fire at 300 yards. A prone, slow-fire course is shot at 600 yards.
It is rare to find a 600-yard range in New England; those ranges that provide 200-yard distances may use proportioned targets to produce the visual effect of the longer distances, but put competitors at a disadvantage when they go to Camp Perry to shoot in full 600-yard matches.
The Oyster River Range has been in operation since 1972, when Jura moved his school photography business and a budding gun shop from Rockland to Warren. He and a shooting friend, Dick Freeman of Rockland, found 67 acres of undeveloped land on Route 90. Since then, the range has been home to nearly every type of formal and informal shooting sport, indoor and outdoor, including a popular rifle and pistol cast-bullet tournament held each spring.
Jura said the accomplishment he was most proud of was formation and training of a junior shooting club, which won state and national recognition.
Jura said that he and his wife, Joyce, may re-enter the shooting sports after their retirement. He added that he still has seven grandchildren that may want to learn the shooting sports.

Hunger, luxury and socialism in Havana

Abstract: Hunger is stalking the streets of Havana. The famous ration card which once sufficed for an adequate diet is no longer sufficient. Cubans love grains; but today there is not enough imported wheat to make bread. Cubans must depend on relatives and the black market to get by. Each day is a struggle. A visitor dines with a friend; we have candied grapefruit rinds. There is nothing else in the house. Cuba entices the foreigner with the promise of rapid repatriation of profits, cheap, well-trained and docile labor and simplified bureaucratic procedures. Luxury hotels financed by Spanish, Canadian, and European capital have sprung up all along the 10-mile strip at Varadero beach outside of Havana. [Castro] observed some years ago that you cannot build a socialist society with capitalist incentives, but that is exactly what he is trying to do now. He is emphasizing foreign capital, profits, dollars, competitiveness, individualism. He is decentralizing much of the economy. We asked a wise old communist, who is now head of Cuba's Chamber of Commerce, how these new ideas and values would play against the revolution's principles of collectivism and vertical control. Would the Communist Party survive? Would the revolution? He thought for a moment, and then concluded, with a shrug of his shoulders, "only a magician can tell."

Full text: There will be no celebrations in Havana this year to mark the 40th anniversary of the Cuban revolution. In the past, July 26 was an occasion for parades and speeches, but this time around, as the revolution confronts an economic crisis brought on by the collapse of the Soviet bloc, there is nothing to celebrate.
Hunger is stalking the streets of Havana. The famous ration card which once sufficed for an adequate diet is no longer sufficient. Cubans love grains; but today there is not enough imported wheat to make bread. Cubans must depend on relatives and the black market to get by. Each day is a struggle. A visitor dines with a friend; we have candied grapefruit rinds. There is nothing else in the house.
Bus service has been cut back because there is no petroleum or spare parts. Many factories have been closed down for want of electricity. The idled workers receive 60 percent of their salary, but Cuban officials say this and other generous subsidies which form part of the revolution's "social contract" with the populace will soon have to be reduced. Higher education has already been cut.
What is to be done? Castro, down, but not out, has launched a series of neo-capitalist experiments to save the revolution. Suddenly foreign capitalists and multinational corporations, once reviled as scoundrels and murderers, are being courted. The government has published a list of 130 projects from ice cream factories to steel plants for which it is seeking foreign partners.
Cuba entices the foreigner with the promise of rapid repatriation of profits, cheap, well-trained and docile labor and simplified bureaucratic procedures. Luxury hotels financed by Spanish, Canadian, and European capital have sprung up all along the 10-mile strip at Varadero beach outside of Havana.
The Spanish in particular have responded to this invitation, and have invested perhaps half a billion in tourist hotels. The Grupo Sol of Madrid has just completed a $150 million complex of hotels and vacation condos. These hotels are not designed to cater to visiting intellectuals doing "revolutionary tourism" at subsidized rates, but rather for bourgeois tourists from Canada and Europe and Mexico who want five-star services and are willing to pay for it.
In Havana old hotels are being refurbished and new ones built. Not far from the monument to the Battleship Maine, the government is building the 18-story Cohiba hotel. In the early moring, the hotel's shadow reaches across the city, touching tattered schools with broken windows and unkempt grounds.
This "in your face" contrast of luxury for foreigners and penury for Cubans threatens the social stability of the city. While Cubans try to get by on a bread ration of one roll a day, foreigners with dollars dine heartily on lobsters, beef, shellfish -- whatever they want -- in nearby restaurants.
The government is keenly aware of this contrast. It tries to reason with the populace, pleading for patience, arguing that when a tourist buys one chicken dinner, Cuba earns enough profits to buy 10 chickens for its citizens. But this is hard to swallow for citizens of a revolution in which equality and nationalism are the principal values.
Toward evening on the way to the upscale suburb of Miramar, disturbingly attractive young women in lycra outfits beckon to the passing traffic. They want dollars to buy clothes, go to discos and have a good time. The government which in the 1960s caried out a moral crusade against prostitution now shrugs its shoulders. Vice, government officials argue, is an inescapable cost of tourism.
Castro observed some years ago that you cannot build a socialist society with capitalist incentives, but that is exactly what he is trying to do now. He is emphasizing foreign capital, profits, dollars, competitiveness, individualism. He is decentralizing much of the economy. We asked a wise old communist, who is now head of Cuba's Chamber of Commerce, how these new ideas and values would play against the revolution's principles of collectivism and vertical control. Would the Communist Party survive? Would the revolution? He thought for a moment, and then concluded, with a shrug of his shoulders, "only a magician can tell."

Full text: Being named the "Funniest Person in America" was a mixed blessing for Ellen DeGeneres.
Earning that title after a nationwide search by Showtime in 1982 rescued her from a law office where she was working as a secretary, and gained her a nationwide tour. On the other hand, carrying that title was a heavy burden for the then-obscure New Orleans comic.
"I wasn't prepared for everything that ensued," said DeGeneres, who will share the bill with comedian/impersonator Kevin Pollak at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Maine Center for the Arts. "Touring the country, I've learned that the average IQ is pretty down there. People actually expected me to be the funniest person in America."
Still that led to other jobs, which eventually yielded a shot on "The Tonight Show" in 1986. She earned the distinction of being the only female comic to be invited by Johnny Carson to sit on the couch on her first appearance.
That was a long way from her start on a whim years earlier, when DeGeneres performed at a benefit after a request from some friends.
"I worked up some materials and did it," she said. "I wasn't nervous. Someone saw me that night and asked me to perform at a college. I decided that this is what I wanted to do. I started writing on a regular basis, and got into it."
During her lean years, DeGeneres did all manner of odd jobs. She tended bar, worked at a car wash, babysat, waited tables, demonstrated vacuum cleaners, served as an employment counselor and shucked oysters.
"Every single thing I did, I made weird," she said.
Audiences don't always appreciate the preparation and the timing that goes into successful stand-up comedy, said DeGeneres, who plays 100 to 150 dates a year.
"There are so many comedians on TV today that people think it's easier than it is, that anyone can do it," she said. "But any little disruption affects what you're doing, and can throw off the next joke and the next transition."
DeGeneres appeared regularly on "The Tonight Show" and "The Arsenio Hall Show." She has also been spotlighted on HBO specials, including "Women of the Night," "One Night Stand" and "The Young Comedians' Reunion." Her "HBO's One Night Stand -- Command Performance" received a Cable ACE Award nomination.
Like so many stand-up comedians before her, DeGeneres now wants to make her mark as an actress. She appeared in supporting roles in Fox's "Open House" and ABC's "Laurie Hill," both of which disappeared quickly.
Next she's starring in "These Friends of Mine," a midseason replacement series for ABC.
"It's about me and a bunch of friends experiencing life," DeGeneres explained vaguely. "It's not a groundbreaking show, but it's not a typical sitcom. It reflects my style of stand-up."
DeGeneres hopes to have a film lined up after the series is shot, but nothing is firm so far.
"I'm fine with blending my stand-up comedy and acting," she said. "But casting people keep seeing me as a stand-up comic only."
Tickets for the Ellen DeGeneres/Kevin Pollak show are on sale at the Maine Center for the Arts box office, or by calling 581-1755.

Windjammer vessels named to historic register Seven still-active Penobscot Bay ships living examples of Maine nautical past

Abstract: Seven vessels in the windjammer fleet have been added to the National Historic Register, "Quite a tribute to the people who restored them," [Reny Stackpole] said Monday. With the Bowdoin, which was designated in 1989, and the Victory Chimes, which is expected to be added, there will be nine historic vessels in Penobscot Bay. Isaac H. Evans, built in 1886 as an oyster schooner in Mauricetown, sailed Delaware Bay for 85 years, making her the oldest oyster schooner still under sail. More than 18,000 hours went into her restoration, and it was one of the first schooners to be rebuilt for the schooner trade. She is captained by Ed Glaser. J. and E. Riggin, captained by Dave Allen, was built in Dorchester, N.J., in 1927 for the oyster dredging trade. The Riggin is known for its speed and won the first and only formal oyster schooner race even held on Delaware Bay. In 1974, the owners found the unrigged hull moored off Cape Cod, towed her to Maine and rebuilt it as a passenger vessel.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Penobscot Bay is the only place in the country with "living examples of working, sailing craft of historic significance" which date back to the turn of the century, according to Reny Stackpole of the Penobscot Marine Museum.
Seven vessels in the windjammer fleet have been added to the National Historic Register, "Quite a tribute to the people who restored them," Stackpole said Monday. With the Bowdoin, which was designated in 1989, and the Victory Chimes, which is expected to be added, there will be nine historic vessels in Penobscot Bay.
"They are a living example of the working, sailing craft and are a great calling card for Penobscot Bay," Stackpole said.
Stackpole has worked with the Constitution in Boston and the whaling vessel Charles W. Morgan at Mystic Seaport. But by charter, these vessels can no longer sail. The windjammer fleet is still active, carrying passengers on weekly trips across the bay.
The vessels added include the following:
American Eagle, built in Gloucester, Mass., in 1930, where she fished for 53 years. Two years of restoration by Capt. John Foss and his crew made the vessel "look and act like a new boat," Stackpole said.
Grace Bailey, built in Patchogue, N.Y., in 1882 as a coasting schooner hauling timber and granite for the West Indian trade until 1940 when she started carrying passengers. The 80-foot coaster was the flagship for the original schooner fleet and is now captained by Ray Williamson.
Isaac H. Evans, built in 1886 as an oyster schooner in Mauricetown, sailed Delaware Bay for 85 years, making her the oldest oyster schooner still under sail. More than 18,000 hours went into her restoration, and it was one of the first schooners to be rebuilt for the schooner trade. She is captained by Ed Glaser.
Lewis R. French, built in Christmas Cove in 1871, claims title to being the oldest vessel in the windjammer fleet. For more than a century the 64-foot coasting schooner carried salt fish, coal, lime, bricks and even Christmas trees, to pay her way. The French is skippered by Dan Pease.
Mercantile, launched in Little Deer Isle in 1916 as a shallow draft coaster. It carried salt fish, barrel staves and firewood for Rockport's lime kilns. It became a cruise schooner in 1942 under the ownership of Frank Smith, the founder of the windjammer trade, and is now captained by Ray Williamson.
J. and E. Riggin, captained by Dave Allen, was built in Dorchester, N.J., in 1927 for the oyster dredging trade. The Riggin is known for its speed and won the first and only formal oyster schooner race even held on Delaware Bay. In 1974, the owners found the unrigged hull moored off Cape Cod, towed her to Maine and rebuilt it as a passenger vessel.
The Stephen Taber, the oldest documented sailing vessel in continuous service in the United States. The vessel was built as acoasting schooner in 1871 in Glenwood, N.J., and earned her way carrying bricks, seed oysters, vegetables and coal, before joining the pleasure fleet. The Taber's captains are Ken and Helen Barnes.

Funding requests top Lubec meeting agenda Mapping, assessing bill virtually doubled

Author: Paul Sylvain Of the NEWS Staff

Abstract: As [Mark Decoteau] explained Thursday, the bid had been readvertised to include a complete revaluation of private and commercial properties in Lubec in addition to assessing services, as had been originally advertised. Selectmen "forgot" that the May bid was the second part of a two-part bid submitted by [Gary L. Geaghan], and represented costs only for the additionally advertised revaluation services, Decoteau said. Geaghan's original bid for assessing stood unchanged. The realization, caught only after Decoteau arrived as new town office manager in June, meant the bid had been "effectively doubled," Decoteau said. "Instead of a $15,000-a-year job, it now is a $30,000-a-year job." It also meant that Honeywell's bid was about $20,000 lower, not $22,500 higher, than Geaghan's total bid.

Full text: LUBEC -- Residents here, just three months after holding their annual town meeting, will be asked at a special town meeting Tuesday to raise more than $21,000 in a seven-article warrant to cover additional municipal expenses for the coming year.
The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. Tuesday, July 20, at the Lubec High School.
A request for an additional $7,235 for increases in premiums for municipal insurance coverage tops the issues.
It could have been worse.
Earlier this month, Town Office Manager Mark Decoteau prepared selectmen for what he thought would be a more-than-$21,000 increase in annual insurance premiums. In looking closer at his figures, Decoteau discovered the increase was annual, and not monthly, through the remainder of the year.
Another article asks that $5,000 be raised for the lease of a Northern Data Systems computer package at the town office.
Selectmen this spring entered into a contract with Lubec-based Max-Parry Inc. for financial consulting services through the remainder of the fiscal year ending Feb. 28, 1994. The contract included provisions for leasing the computer system used by the firm.
By contract, the town is committed to paying the firm $500 a month, or $5,000 during the 10-month life of the contract, for a variety of financial services.
In return, Max-Parry agreed to provide computer software and hardware needed to establish a "completely integrated municipal management package" marketed by Northern Data Systems. The software package includes counter cash receipting, budgetary accounting, tax billing, payroll and record keeping of accounts payable, or warrant items.
Decoteau told selectmen Thursday that the computer hardware had arrived at the town office, and that tax and other data were already being entered into the system. He predicted that selectmen will begin receiving updated, line-by-line budget printouts "within the next few meetings."
The warrant's final article asks that an additional $8,800 be raised to pay for mapping and assessing services being provided by Gary L. Geaghan of Ellsworth.
In May, Geaghan was awarded a contract for three years to conduct an assessment and revaluation of private and commercial property in Lubec.
Geaghan's bid of $47,500 appeared to be the lowest of two proposals opened by selectmen, who turned down a $70,020 bid from Brenda G. Honeywell of Alexander.
But as Decoteau explained Thursday, the bid had been readvertised to include a complete revaluation of private and commercial properties in Lubec in addition to assessing services, as had been originally advertised.
Selectmen "forgot" that the May bid was the second part of a two-part bid submitted by Geaghan, and represented costs only for the additionally advertised revaluation services, Decoteau said. Geaghan's original bid for assessing stood unchanged.
The realization, caught only after Decoteau arrived as new town office manager in June, meant the bid had been "effectively doubled," Decoteau said. "Instead of a $15,000-a-year job, it now is a $30,000-a-year job." It also meant that Honeywell's bid was about $20,000 lower, not $22,500 higher, than Geaghan's total bid.
Selectmen in May favored Geaghan's proposal, not only for its apparent lower cost, but also because of his use of a Northern Data Systems program and hardware, making his system compatible with the Northern Data Systems computer installed last week at the Lubec Town Office.
Geaghan promised in writing to spend at least one day each week in Lubec. The town's assessing records will be entered into the computer, creating a permanent data base to build on.
A request for $100 in Article 6 resulted from an oversight in preparing the annual town meeting warrant and amounts to "routine housekeeping," Decoteau said. If approved, the money will be used "in support of the Lubec Charter Commission."
Residents at the April town meeting voted to establish the commission. However, a separate article to fund its operation was not included in the annual meeting warrant. As a result, no money was raised.
Residents on Tuesday also will be asked to authorize selectmen to acquire the Frederic C. Lawrence property "for the cost of back taxes due on that property," and to enact a municipal shellfish conservation ordinance.

Abstract: Tolman said he chose to make the gift to honor his grandfather, Earl Tolman, and his longtime efforts to protect the Oyster River Bog and its environs.

Full text: ROCKLAND -- Maynard E. Tolman II has given the Oyster River Bog Association a conservation easement on 15 acres that he had purchased for the specific purpose of keeping it "forever wild."
Tolman said he chose to make the gift to honor his grandfather, Earl Tolman, and his longtime efforts to protect the Oyster River Bog and its environs. He also decided to do himself what he so often asks or other landowners -- to contribute either land or money to the land trust of which he now is president.
"The bog has great meaning to me," said Tolman, "having been raised on its edge and visited the interior many times over the years. Others should also know of its importance. My grandfather, Earl Tolman, was one of a few people that started the organization. ... I am the first board member to make a land donation. Perhaps this will spark others to do the same thing."
About 13 percent of the bog's 6,000 acres has been protected through contributions such as Tolman's.

Full text: JONESPORT -- The Department of Enviromental Protection has given Jonesport authority to keep the town's landfill open until Aug. 30, 1993. Thereafter, the town is expected to operate a licensed solid waste transfer station at Snare Creek for Jonesport and Beals.
Karen Knuuti, representing the DEP, said in her recent letter to the town that Jonesport would be allowed to continue disposal of white goods, metals, construction and demolition debris, tires, municipal solid waste, and shellfish waste at the Snare Creek facility.
Last week, selectmen said they were waiting for a reply from consulting engineer Dean Bradshaw regarding the cost, effectiveness and durability of using ready-made cement retaining walls as compared with the cement and rip-rap proposed in his engineering plan for the Jonesport Transfer Station.
Bids for the construction will be requested as soon as an updated engineering report is received from Bradshaw.
Judson Carver, a local resident, discussed with the selectmen the town's policy on construction bids. Selectmen approved Howard Mills Jr.'s recommendation that bids be accepted from all interested contractors.

Abstract: "I invited them to try some of my mussels, but it was a tussle to even get them to taste them. They said `No, thank you, I don't eat mussels.' But pretty soon those who had tasted them began to take second and third helpings and said my smoked mussels were really good. Even some of the older men ended up eating mussels just like they'd eat dried fish," Thompson said. "There's almost no end to the way you can eat mussels," said Shelba Thompson of Cape Split Seafood Co. "Smoked and dipped in mustard or salsa, with cream cheese or sour cream on a cracker. Smoked mussels are wonderful because you can eat them plain, or dress them up into a great hors d'oeuvre. Fresh mussels can be steamed, and eaten plain or with a sauce, and they are absolutely delicious deep-fried." On Friday, Gay's Supermarket in Machias was offering 8 ounces of Cape Split Seafood's smoked mussels for $4.29. Also, a 3-ounce package of dried pollock was selling for $3.29. A variety of pickled mussels by Hamblen's Seafood from Deer Isle included vinegar, broth, onions, peppers, herbs and spices in an 8-ounce container for $3.99.

Full text: ADDISON -- Although natives of the Down East area tend to seriously resist change, they have begun to enjoy eating smoked mussels. Actually, David W. Thompson of South Addison has some of the area's "hard-boiled" fishermen literally eating out of his hand.
Thompson knows his fellow Down Easters almost as well as he knows his mussels.
When he was a young boy, he lived for a time on Great Wass Island, which is the larger island within the town of Beals. Later, he camped with his relatives at the Moose Peak Lighthouse Station, located on an island just south of Steele Harbor Island.
"My roots go way back among people in the Jonesport-Beals area," he said.
"After I started smoking mussels about eight years ago, I took some of them down to Osmond Beal's boat shop at Beals. It was in the wintertime, and several of the older men were sitting around and watching Osmond and his crew finish building a boat," he said.
"I invited them to try some of my mussels, but it was a tussle to even get them to taste them. They said `No, thank you, I don't eat mussels.' But pretty soon those who had tasted them began to take second and third helpings and said my smoked mussels were really good. Even some of the older men ended up eating mussels just like they'd eat dried fish," Thompson said.
Most people who try smoked mussels for the first time like them, especially if they like clams. Mussels are available from CSS all year, but the peak sales period is during the Christmas and New Year holidays.
"There's almost no end to the way you can eat mussels," said Shelba Thompson of Cape Split Seafood Co. "Smoked and dipped in mustard or salsa, with cream cheese or sour cream on a cracker. Smoked mussels are wonderful because you can eat them plain, or dress them up into a great hors d'oeuvre. Fresh mussels can be steamed, and eaten plain or with a sauce, and they are absolutely delicious deep-fried."
Long enjoyed in other areas of the country, mussels have become the "nouveau shellfish" in Washington County, according to Dianne Tilton of the Sunrise County Economic Council. The novelty seafood has become available in many grocery stores in the Down East area.
Cape Split Seafood, located on Moose Neck Road in Addison, harvests mussels and sells them to a growing number of regular customers. The company also cures and distributes dried fish and marinated periwinkles.
On Friday, Gay's Supermarket in Machias was offering 8 ounces of Cape Split Seafood's smoked mussels for $4.29. Also, a 3-ounce package of dried pollock was selling for $3.29. A variety of pickled mussels by Hamblen's Seafood from Deer Isle included vinegar, broth, onions, peppers, herbs and spices in an 8-ounce container for $3.99.
"The secret to mussels," according to Shelba Thompson, "is to dive for them. The mussels you pick up along the shore are gritty, but in deep water they're very clean."
David Thompson said he dives into 25 to 30 feet of water to gather mussels for his seafood company. Mussels grow from seed to commercial size in three years.
"They grow much faster than clams," said David. "A mussel siphons 12 gallons of water every 24 hours, so they eat a lot."
The company has grown since 1985 from a room in the Thompson house to a small building where the shucking took place. Later, the business moved to facilities at Jimmy Bucknam's clam factory. The Thompsons imported a pair of stainless steel "smokers" from England, and have used applewood sawdust and shavings to create the smoke for curing.
Within the next few weeks, the Thompsons will open a new 56-by-36-foot processing plant that will house the shucking room, coolers and a cooking room. The smoking operation will be retained at the present location until a second phase of construction expands the new plant.
The business employs about 10 people, including the Thompson family.

Lawsuit seeks to halt transfer station construction

Abstract: According to the lawsuit, filed on behalf of the plaintiffs by attorney George Singal of Bangor, the property owners are seeking a revocation of the setback waivers four of them signed last year. The setback waivers, for property owners within 250 feet of the transfer station site, were required as part of the town's permitting process from the DEP. As stated in the lawsuit, four of the property owners signed the waivers because they were told by one or more selectmen that no other site was available and/or affordable for the transfer station. They claim they also signed the waivers because the same selectmen said the station could not be located at the site of the present landfill and that the landfill site could not be approved by the DEP as a transfer station site. When contacted about the lack of waivers by all abutting property owners, the DEP decided a signature by the occupying landowner, [Joseph Reynolds], would suffice, [Stu Marckoon] said Thursday. The DEP has not revoked the permit based on that information, Marckoon added.

Full text: LAMOINE -- A lawsuit against the town of Lamoine seeks to halt construction of the transfer station on Route 184.
Filed July 1 in Hancock County Superior Court, the lawsuit by six Lamoine property owners seeks a revocation of the Department of Environmental Protection permit for the transfer station and a cessation of all construction at the site.
The transfer station is about 85 percent complete and the town has received permission to keep its landfill open until July 31, when the building is expected to be finished.
Additionally, the lawsuit calls for compensation for the "noneconomic injuries" sustained by the property owners, costs associated with the lawsuit and any other relief deemed appropriate by the court.
The lawsuit names the DEP as the second defendant. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit are listed as John Smith, Joseph Reynolds, Charles Reynolds Sr., Charles Reynolds Jr., Nancy Sargent and Leon Sargent.
Two local shellfish dealers are footing the bill for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Dean Smith and Mike Briggs, owners of two fish processing businesses in Lamoine, have said in previous weeks that they wanted the town to halt construction of the station, since they have been informed their commercial waste will not be accepted at the transfer station.
Smith said Thursday two attorneys had advised them that any lawsuit questioning the town's right to deny space to a commercial entity could prove extremely costly and protracted. "So we were advised we couldn't stop it ourselves and that the better tact would be to draw the abutters into the picture."
Smith said the shellfish dealers had no plans to file suit themselves against the town.
According to the lawsuit, filed on behalf of the plaintiffs by attorney George Singal of Bangor, the property owners are seeking a revocation of the setback waivers four of them signed last year. The setback waivers, for property owners within 250 feet of the transfer station site, were required as part of the town's permitting process from the DEP.
As stated in the lawsuit, four of the property owners signed the waivers because they were told by one or more selectmen that no other site was available and/or affordable for the transfer station. They claim they also signed the waivers because the same selectmen said the station could not be located at the site of the present landfill and that the landfill site could not be approved by the DEP as a transfer station site.
The property owners contend that that information was not true. "Plaintiffs have since learned not only that there were other available and affordable sites on which the transfer station could be built, but also that the site of (the) existing landfill had not been ruled out by DEP and might have been approved," the lawsuit states.
The four state they have suffered "substantial and potentially irreparable harm in that the proposed transfer station will cause them to suffer noxious odors, increased traffic, noise and diminishment of their enjoyment of their property."
In June, Joseph Reynolds, Nancy Sargent and Smith signed affidavits indicating they would not have signed the waivers if they had known the town had other options for the station.
In addition, the lawsuit contends that two property owners -- Charles Reynolds Sr. and Charles Reynolds Jr. -- never waived their rights to a 250-foot setback and that such waivers are required for a DEP permit.
"Defendant DEP granted a permit to Lamoine for the establishment of the transfer station on the site abutting and within 250 (feet) of their property without their approval, in violation of state law," the lawsuit contends.
The lawsuit states the two Reynoldses "have suffered and will continue to suffer substantial economic harm due to devaluation of their property and noneconomic harm due to the presence of a solid waste transfer station ... and the associated traffic and diminution of the aesthetic quality of their land."
The two Reynoldses, heirs with four other family members to the property now occupied by Joseph Reynolds, also signed affidavits last month indicating they had never given their approval for any waiver to the setback requirements and signified they had no intention of giving the waivers.
According to town administrator Stu Marckoon, the two Reynoldses and the other heirs indeed were overlooked when the town sent out requests for setback waivers last year. The DEP and the engineer thought all necessary signatures had been obtained when the permit was granted.
When the mistake was brought to light on April 14, 1993, the town sent out letters asking for waivers from the heirs. One heir returned a signed waiver.
When contacted about the lack of waivers by all abutting property owners, the DEP decided a signature by the occupying landowner, Joseph Reynolds, would suffice, Marckoon said Thursday. The DEP has not revoked the permit based on that information, Marckoon added.
Marckoon contends the town could not have placed the transfer station on top of the present landfill. It is possible, he said, the town could have received a DEP permit to place the station elsewhere on the 29 acre site, but that option was ruled out due to the potential expense involved. The expense would have involved locating the outer limits of the buried garbage site, with associated engineering costs.
Since the other Route 184 site was available and since the site already had had hydrological information and engineering studies completed, it was chosen as the less expensive alternative, Marckoon said.

Abstract: Today, the catch is less plentiful, but [Louis Bernardini] hopes to do something about it. His campaign includes a petition that will be sent to William Brennan, commissioner of the Department of Marine Resources. Bernardini said he believes the decline in fish and shellfish populations has been caused by the constant scallop dragging in the St. Croix River area. He said he would like to see the area closed to dragging on both sides of the border. Bernardini also sent a letter to Wendy W. Wright, director of the St. Andrews Biological Station in New Brunswick, to enlist her support. In his letter Bernardini said, "In the 1950s, '60s and '70s, one could catch flounder anyplace in the St. Croix all the way up to the narrows. Today, it is next to impossible to catch one in the river unless one goes to the mouth of the river on the Canadian or U.S. side. For the past 20 years, I have been fishing 15 to 25 lobster traps May through October, and have been seeing decreasing catches, especially in the last eight years," he wrote.

Full text: CALAIS -- When Calais businessman Louis Bernardini was a young man, lobster, crab and flounder were plentiful in the St. Croix River, and a flounder could be speared in shallow water.
"The other day we pulled 35 traps. We never got a lobster, and we got three crabs," he said.
As a kid, he said, he used to catch many flounder. "You could stand in the mud flats, wait for the tide to come in and spear them," he said.
Today, the catch is less plentiful, but Bernardini hopes to do something about it. His campaign includes a petition that will be sent to William Brennan, commissioner of the Department of Marine Resources. Bernardini said he believes the decline in fish and shellfish populations has been caused by the constant scallop dragging in the St. Croix River area. He said he would like to see the area closed to dragging on both sides of the border.
Bernardini also sent a letter to Wendy W. Wright, director of the St. Andrews Biological Station in New Brunswick, to enlist her support. In his letter Bernardini said, "In the 1950s, '60s and '70s, one could catch flounder anyplace in the St. Croix all the way up to the narrows. Today, it is next to impossible to catch one in the river unless one goes to the mouth of the river on the Canadian or U.S. side. For the past 20 years, I have been fishing 15 to 25 lobster traps May through October, and have been seeing decreasing catches, especially in the last eight years," he wrote.
Bernardini said the crab population, once a major staple along the St. Croix, has nearly disappeared. "Eight years ago, I could catch three 5-gallon pails in a haul, and that was only keeping the largest ones. Today, 10 crabs out of 15 traps would be a lot," he wrote. He said he had discussed the problem with other area fisherman, who had noticed the same decline.
"The St. Croix River is being destroyed by the constant dragging. I have contacted Commissioner Brennan at the Department of Marine Resources in Augusta ... asking that the St. Croix be closed to draggers. ... I would like to see both sides of the river closed to dragging," he wrote. He has asked that the river be closed to all dragging from Liberty Point in Robbinston to Calais, and from St. Andrews to St. Stephen, New Brunswick.
Bernardini also plans to take his case to the St. Croix Waterway Commission, a nonprofit oversight agency that is focused on the future of the river.
Lee Sochasky, director of the St. Croix Waterway Commission, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that she had heard about Bernardini's concerns, but had not yet spoken with him. She said she would support a study to see what impact scallop dragging might have on flounder and lobster stock. She said she could not speculate on what may have caused a decline in the groundfish population.
"Many of the groundfish that were historically here and in the estuary have also disappeared; the causative factors may be further at sea or other things that we can't control. But if some of those factors are things we can control, we should be looking at those and making choices," she said.
She referred calls about scallop dragging to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. They did not return a call to their office.

Clam spawning commences along coast

Abstract: A seemingly harmless summer rain shower, similar to the series of thunderstorms that swept across the county on Wednesday, can be devastating to clam larvae left grounded on clam flats. The combination of a deluge of freshwater and a hot summer sun can be fatal to clam larvae, according to marine biologist David Clifford of East Machias. Many productive clam beds remain closed because of water pollution. "The clams themselves are perfectly healthy in those areas where too high levels of fecal coliform bacteria exist. The clams love it," said Barbara Arter of the Cooperative Extension office at Machias. "But it can make people ill." She is devoting her efforts to helping municipalities in the county improve water quality on clam flats. According to Clifford, Jonesporters had considered trying to establish a clam depuration plant to help local clammers harvest clams from flats closed because of pollution. With the new cleanup program in gear, however, members of the local clam committee and selectmen have decided against using a depuration plant. "They intend to do their own harvesting after they clean up the flats," he said.

Full text: MACHIAS -- The annual spawning of softshell clams is under way on Washington County's jagged coastline. During the next three weeks, many of the eggs released into area coves, bays and rivers will be fertilized by adult clams.
The life of the Maine clam -- from egg to adult marketable mollusk -- is marked by a host of natural predators and man-made threats.
A seemingly harmless summer rain shower, similar to the series of thunderstorms that swept across the county on Wednesday, can be devastating to clam larvae left grounded on clam flats. The combination of a deluge of freshwater and a hot summer sun can be fatal to clam larvae, according to marine biologist David Clifford of East Machias.
"Every phase of a clam's life has problems. Some are natural and some are caused by people," he said. Among the natural disasters that can wipe out clams are big coastal storms like the one that hit the clam beds at Cutler last winter and killed thousands of clams by washing them out of their bed.
The most serious plague on clams is pollution. "This area CLOSED TO ALL DIGGING of clams, mussels, quahogs, oysters, carnivorous whelks or snails BECAUSE OF POLLUTION" is too often the message posted along the perimeter of a cove where the environment may, to the nonscientific eye, appear to be in perfect order.
"You can't see it happening, but you can be sure that the clam's environment and food chain are being constantly influenced by water quality," Clifford said. "You can't pollute it and dig it too."
Towns that reject waste-water treatment plants or cluster systems set back the clock on the reopening of clam beds to commercial clam diggers.
"The good news," Clifford said, "is that all of the flats at the head of Cutler Harbor were reopened last year to diggers, because eight or 10 new cluster (septic) systems replaced the sources of pollution. The water cleared up very quickly." Also, two years ago, Moose River in Trescott was reopened to digging because the quality of water above the flats was improved as the result of a cleanup program.
Many productive clam beds remain closed because of water pollution. "The clams themselves are perfectly healthy in those areas where too high levels of fecal coliform bacteria exist. The clams love it," said Barbara Arter of the Cooperative Extension office at Machias. "But it can make people ill." She is devoting her efforts to helping municipalities in the county improve water quality on clam flats.
One of her prized projects involves a cleanup of clam flats at Jonesport, where the town, Jonesport-Beals High School and Cooperative Extension are teaming up in a long-term program to improve water quality. A new laboratory at J-BHS will be used to test water samples taken from test plots in coves and bays.
According to Clifford, Jonesporters had considered trying to establish a clam depuration plant to help local clammers harvest clams from flats closed because of pollution. With the new cleanup program in gear, however, members of the local clam committee and selectmen have decided against using a depuration plant. "They intend to do their own harvesting after they clean up the flats," he said.
Pollution has been "slowly and quietly" building up, during the past several decades in many of the coastal areas, said Clifford, because there are more homes located at the ocean's edge. Those homes have the modern convenience of running water and flushable toilets, while older homes and cottages had traditional outhouses away from the beaches. The relatively low concentration of fecal coliform bacteria from such facilities was not a problem 50 or 60 years ago.
People in the Down East area who frequently cooked and ate clams as part of their regular diet, according to Clifford, perhaps built up an immunity to some of the health problems that now worry public health officials. "Clams were not sold out of state in large quantities until the advent of the steamer market. Now, we have more regulations to protect the public health," he said.
