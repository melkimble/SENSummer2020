Ronald E. Johnson, 49, a lifelong lobsterman who served 13 years on the Board of Selectmen, died Thursday at Parkview Memorial Hospital, Brunswick.
Mr. Johnson was only 8 when he began lobstering with his father, Albert Johnson, out of Mackerel Cove on Bailey Island.
His profound love for lobstering and the ocean was obvious from the start, said his wife, Kathleen R. Bernier Johnson. Every year, when it was time to return to school in September, he'd beg his dad for just a few more days to go lobstering, she said.
Mr. Johnson's own son, Matthew, 11, has already lobstered for a few years with his dad, and they were recently fixing up the "Kathleen R." for the upcoming season. It was supposed to be launched this afternoon, said his wife.
The 34-foot vessel, which he bought from his father, was the first fiberglass fishing boat in Mackerel Cove on Bailey Island.
As a young man, Mr. Johnson fished out of a small outboard, which sank when he was trying to save a friend's lobster boat from sinking in heavy seas.
On another cold winter's day, he and his father were out after dark, and the family was getting worried. It turned out Mackerel Cove had frozen over, said his wife, and Mr. Johnson had to sit out on the bow and break the ice while his father guided the boat to the mooring.
Mr. Johnson was well known around Harpswell and its islands as a longtime selectman, and as the founder of the Harpswell Youth Baseball League, which he ran for many years.
"He loved the town," said his wife. "Everybody knew him from the youth league, working with the kids. He was overwhelmingly voted in every year."
"Ron was an anchor in the town," said Gary LeClair, a friend and fellow lobsterman. "He was a gentleman lobsterman, a pleasure to fish around. As a selectman, his concerns were for the native Harpswell community and for the fishing industry, and making sure we could all live here for the rest of our lives."
Mr. Johnson was a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan, a season ticket holder of the Portland Pirates hockey team and a Portland Sea Dogs fan.
He served on the town's Shellfish Committee, the Harbor and Waterfront Committee, and was harbormaster for a short while. He was a member of the Harpswell Boat Races Committee, which organizes the annual lobster boat races off South Harpswell, and was the race announcer and helped pass out the trophies with his brother, Andy Johnson, the race founder.
He was a deacon and moderator of West Harpswell Baptist Church, a former Sunday school teacher at the First Free Will Baptist Church, Brunswick, a steward of Merriconeag Grange, a member of Harpswell Neck Fire and Rescue, and past president and vice president of Sage Swingers, Brunswick.
Born in Brunswick, a son of Albert E. and Catherine Stevens Johnson, he graduated in 1967 from Brunswick High School. He lived on Bailey Island, and later Orr's Island before building a home on Ash Point Road in South Harpswell.
Surviving are his wife of 20 years, of Harpswell; his parents of Bailey Island; a son, Matthew Christian Johnson of Harpswell; a brother, AndrewJohnson of Harpswell; and a sister, Kathie May Rollins of Bowdoinham.
A memorial service will be held at 2:30 p.m. Sunday at West Harpswell Baptist Church. Dr. Peter Emmett will officiate. A reception in his memory will follow at the West Harpswell School. Burial will be in West Harpswell Cemetery. Arrangements are by Brackett Funeral Home, Brunswick.

Abstract: The Town Council has scheduled two special meetings for this week to address pressing issues. On Thursday, the council will meet with trustees of the Portland Water District for the first time since talks broke off in February over whether to move the town's boat launch in Sebago Lake village. The town and the district disagree over whether the launch should be moved. The water district has proposed moving it to land outside the two-mile zone where body contact with the lake is prohibited. It is offering $800,000 to help with the move.

Town Council schedules special meetings
The Town Council has scheduled two special meetings for this week to address pressing issues.
On Thursday, the council will meet with trustees of the Portland Water District for the first time since talks broke off in February over whether to move the town's boat launch in Sebago Lake village.
The town and the district disagree over whether the launch should be moved. The water district has proposed moving it to land outside the two-mile zone where body contact with the lake is prohibited. It is offering $800,000 to help with the move.
The two parties were told by state legislators this month to go back into negotiations or else the Legislature will come up with a solution.
Thursday's meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Edna Libby School music room.
On Friday, the council will take up two issues that must be settled that day to get onto the ballot for the June 8 town elections.
One ballot question would ask voters whether they want Standish to spend $1.8 million to design and build a municipal office-public safety building on Route 35. The other would ask voters whether the town should buy an ambulance for $132,000.
That meeting is also scheduled for 7 p.m. in the music room of the Edna Libby School.
SCARBOROUGH

INVADERS ON OUR SHORES IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE: NON-NATIVE SPECIES WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER WHOLE ECOSYSTEMS FIND THEIR WAY TO MAINE'S WATERS. WILL THE JAPANESE SHORE CRAB BE NEXT?

Author: JOHN RICHARDSON Staff Writer

Abstract: The little European crab, which probably came to America as a stowaway on a trans-Atlantic ship more than a century ago, had spread steadily up the Atlantic coast, devouring soft-shell clams and, by the late 1950s, decimating Maine's clamming industry. "It wiped us out, practically," said [Dana] Wallace, a former state marine scientist. The Japanese shore crab arrived on the mid-Atlantic coast about 11 years ago, probably in the hull of a cargo ship, and has been found as far north as New Hampshire.

Full text: Dana Wallace remembers fighting the green crab like it was a virus that infected the Maine coast.
The little European crab, which probably came to America as a stowaway on a trans-Atlantic ship more than a century ago, had spread steadily up the Atlantic coast, devouring soft-shell clams and, by the late 1950s, decimating Maine's clamming industry. "It wiped us out, practically," said Wallace, a former state marine scientist.
Now there is another invader on the horizon, a tougher, more prolific crab so voracious that it could be a threat to the green crab itself.
The Japanese shore crab arrived on the mid-Atlantic coast about 11 years ago, probably in the hull of a cargo ship, and has been found as far north as New Hampshire. It may already be here, hiding in the rocks along the low-tide line, eating seaweed, mussels and clams.
Invader species are nothing new to the Maine coast, and not all are harmful. But scientists warn that exotic species are crossing oceans so fast on modern ships that coastal states face new waves of invasions that can wreak ecological and economic havoc.
"Species that we've had for a long time and now just take for granted were invasive species (at one time). It's just that it's really speeded up now," said Robin Hadlock Seeley, a Cornell University marine researcher from Freeport. "At the rate we're introducing new species, the marine community is in a constant state of rapid change. Probably there has been no other time in history when organisms have been passed around the world at the rate they are now."
So-called bioinvasions have drawn the attention of the U.S. Coast Guard, President Clinton, and the U.N. agency that oversees global shipping. Researchers say marine invasions in the United States cost $7 billion a year in damage and control efforts.
An estimated 3,000 species are carried from their homes to foreign ports every day in the water pumped in and out of commercial ship hulls. Most of them die in their new environments. About one in 100 survive to find rich food sources and no natural predators.
Some invaders actually have commercial value. The common periwinkle, for example, came from Europe about 150 years ago, and now supports a small Maine industry that collects and processes the snails for an ethnic food market.
Other invaders can create monumental, and expensive, headaches.
The zebra mussel is still the most famous example of the damage an aquatic invader can cause.
It was carried by ships into the Great Lakes from Europe, and has since spread through inland waters in 19 Eastern states. The mussels steal food and oxygen from native species and clog intake pipes of electric generating plants, costing an estimated $5 billion a year in damage and control efforts.
Maine's most notorious marine invader remains the green crab -- for now.
"It's been a terrible problem for the state of Maine for a long time," said Seeley, who has studied the green crab's impact on wildlife along the Maine coast.
The green crab arrived on the mid-Atlantic coast from Europe around the time of the Civil War. It reached Casco Bay around 1905, Bar Harbor around 1926 and Lubec around 1951.
Except for use as bait, it has shown no redeeming commercial value.
In the 1950s, warmer water temperatures helped the population explode along the Maine coast.
At about the same time, clam diggers began finding fewer clams in Maine's mudflats.
"The assumption was it was just overdigging; then we found these crabs were so abundant they were killing all the clams," said Walter Welch, a retired federal and state biologist who monitored the invasion for several decades.
Smaller crabs eat baby clams at the surface of the mud, or eat the exposed necks of mature clams. Once it grows to about 3 inches across, a green crab can dig down to the clams and eat at will.
Welch, Wallace and others tried trapping the crabs to save the clams. They put herring in a dozen modified lobster traps and set them out in Southport.
Every day for a month, the traps would be filled with hundreds of crabs. The crab-fighters eventually gave up because new crabs kept moving in.
"We were still getting more crabs on the last day than we did when we started," said Welch.
Fences worked to protect individual clam beds, but were too expensive for widespread use. Netting placed across clam beds also helped, and is still used in some parts of Maine.
In the face of the crab onslaught, Maine's commercial catch of soft-shell clams plummeted in the 1950s, from nearly 7 million pounds to about 1.5 million pounds.
Cold winters in the 1960s cut down the green crab population. But the crustaceans have remained a major predator, exploding during milder cycles like the one Maine is now experiencing.
The soft-shell clam industry now digs about 2 million pounds a year, worth about $7 million. And the green crab is still taking a healthy chunk of the resource, said Brian Beal, associate professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias.
In a recent experiment, Beal covered half of a clam bed in Jonesport with protective netting and left the other half exposed. Under the netting, 92 percent of the clams survived eight months. Only 60 percent survived in the area left open to crabs.
Nationwide, the green crab causes $44 million a year in damage and control costs, according to a new Cornell study.
Other invaders almost certainly are on their way, thanks to patterns of international commerce.
Modern ships carry a myriad of stowaways around the globe, and are considered the primary vehicles for invading species.
Ships have tanks in their hulls that they fill with tons of seawater as ballast. When the ships are not loaded with cargo, the ballast keeps them stable and easier to steer. In one port, cargo is unloaded and water is pumped into the hulls. At another port, the water is pumped out as new cargo is loaded.
Bigger, faster ships are expanding into new and more exotic trade routes, so that ports around the world continually trade fluids.
There are other ways for the species to travel.
Aquaculture industries routinely import foreign species. Despite strict controls, they can and do escape.
Species imported by the aquarium industry also have become invaders.
New efforts to fight invasions mostly focus on ballast water.
Both the U.N. International Maritime Organization and the U.S. Coast Guard now recommend that ships exchange, or flush, their ballast water in the open ocean between ports. The theory is that coastal species will die in the open sea, and any species picked up there would not survive in a coastal harbor.
New rules are expected as soon as this week from the Coast Guard. The flushing will likely remain voluntary, but the Coast Guard may start inspecting ballast water records when ships arrive in the United States.
In January, Clinton and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced expanded federal efforts to study and combat invasive species, both on land and water.
Babbitt warned that the impacts of marine invasions can be more extensive and more permanent than the largest oil spills.
Some coastal states also are increasing efforts to monitor invasions and try to prevent damage. Maine no longer has scientists dedicated to monitoring the species, but a federally funded program called the Maine Invasive Species Council was recently created to plan for land and water invasions.
At least two new ocean species could draw more attention to the problem here.
Codium is a green seaweed from Asia that came to Boothbay Harbor in a shipment of oysters in 1964, according to Larry Harris, a professor of marine biology at the University of New Hampshire.
Small colonies have since spread around the coast with little known impact. But within the last several years, a codium population exploded around the Isles of Shoals off New Hampshire.
"Now it is the dominant plant," Harris said. "It just crowds out and takes over."
Snails and other forage species that feed on kelp do not eat codium. Urchins, one of Maine's most valuable commercial marine resources, also eat kelp but have little taste for the codium.
Harris doesn't know what triggered the growth. Now he wonders if established colonies in places such as Casco Bay and Pemaquid Point will be next to explode.
"Are they sort of waiting for some condition to change or for the next genetic adaptation, until they suddenly explode and take over the whole coastal zone?" Harris said. "If you look at the Isles of Shoals it is certainly very scary."
Many are eyeing the Japanese shore crab as well.
John McDermott, a marine biology professor at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., first recorded its arrival at Cape May, N.J., in 1988.
Studies showed the crab is from the western Pacific, and that its native habitat stretches north into Russia. It should feel right at home in the cold water of the Gulf of Maine.
McDermott has monitored the spread of the crab. He found one while combing the rocky shore of North Hampton, N.H., last October. He also looked across the border in Wells, but did not find any pioneers there yet.
The crab has no known commercial value. It could carry a huge cost, however.
Japanese shore crabs only grow to 2 or 3 inches across, but can reproduce into dense colonies. They have taken over habitats in Long Island Sound, with nearly 100 found in a square meter.
They eat everything, from seaweeds to periwnkles to blue mussels and soft-shell clams. They may even eat green crabs.
McDermott said it's a matter of time before the crab establishes itself in Maine.
Some observers fear the worst -- another voracious predator that will threaten native species and compete with Maine's clamdiggers. But no one knows for sure, and McDermott, for one, hopes his discovery has a happier ending.
"Some people are saying that it is displacing the green crab and may upset the whole rocky intertidal community," he said. "I don't think that's necessarily true."

If not in Maine already, its arrival is just a matter of time, they say. KEY Distribution of the Japanese shore crab along the United States' East Coast. (map of Eastern seaboard) 1988 - 1998 European green crab (Carcinus maenas) Habitat: Native to Europe, arrived in United Satates in middle of 19th century. Currently an established intertidal predator from New Jersey to Nova Scotia. The most common shore crab in Maine, easily found in tide pools and under seaweed. Now also spreading on West Coast. Size: Grows to 3 inches across. Appearance: Fan-shaped shell, greenish black on top. Food: Major predator of soft-shell clams. Impacts: The crab's prey, such as smooth periwinkles, now rare in some areas. Decimated Maine soft- shell clam industry in 1950s and still limits the state's annual harvest. Japanese shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus) Habitat: Native to Japan, and north into Russia. Found on New Jesrsey coast in 1988, after possibly stowing away inside a merchant ship. Has since been found from North Carolina to New Hampshire, and may have expanded into Maine. Size: 2-3 inches across. Appearance: Colors vary, from brown to purple and pink. Has a square-shaped shell with three spines on each side. Claws have red spots and legs have light and dark bands. Food: Eats seaweeds as well as clams, mussels, scallops and fish larvae. Ecological impacts: Unknown, but could displace green crab and affect commercial shellfish resources. p.14A

Abstract: The town's three clam wardens have resigned, which has diggers inthis town of peninsulas and islands worried that thieves are stealing more of their harvest. "Since the general opinion seems to be Harpswell is wide open, the poaching has been more bold," said Skip Purinton, a fisherman and digger who is secretary of the clam committee. Out-of-town diggers have long been known to poach along the town's 216 miles of shoreline, but news of the resignations has made the town more vulnerable than before, say town officials. If there are no wardens to patrol the mud flats, renegade diggers may feel safer in Harpswell territory.

Full text: The town's three clam wardens have resigned, which has diggers inthis town of peninsulas and islands worried that thieves are stealing more of their harvest.
"Since the general opinion seems to be Harpswell is wide open, the poaching has been more bold," said Skip Purinton, a fisherman and digger who is secretary of the clam committee.
Out-of-town diggers have long been known to poach along the town's 216 miles of shoreline, but news of the resignations has made the town more vulnerable than before, say town officials. If there are no wardens to patrol the mud flats, renegade diggers may feel safer in Harpswell territory.
"It's getting to be kind of a panicky situation. Word has gotten out," said Selectman David Chipman.
The clam committee described its concerns this week and selectmen have begun considering whether to hire new wardens -- a former sheriff's deputy and a retired executive have applied -- or contract for two wardens from the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department. The subject was scheduled for the selectmen's meeting Thursday night.
Harpswell diggers say Brunswick diggers have been crossing the border to dig ever since a clam-flat sharing agreement between the towns dissolved about four years ago.
The wardens' resignation has made the situation worse because people know they have little chance of getting arrested, said Scott Moody, a digger and clam committee member, who added that he has seen some poaching.
"It has fueled it some," he said. "It has been a problem since we split up."
Purinton said he hasn't seen poaching since he started digging this spring, but he has heard talk of it from other diggers.
Stolen clams could be worth a lot to locals in the summer when prices climb as high as $100 a bushel. Now they're closer to $40, said Purinton.
"It's costing the clam diggers a lot of money," he said. Harpswell licenses 85 diggers.
Selectman Gordon Weil said the town has long had a problem keeping people on the job as shellfish wardens. The wardens, who receive police training, often quit to take better-paying law enforcement jobs elsewhere.
"We can't just keep doing that over and over again," he said.
The town may want to consider hiring people who would be more willing to stay on longer, said Weil.
Warden Chris Allen left his job last week for a position at the Portland Police Department. The remaining wardens, Josh Potvin, who plans to leave next week, and Janelle Garrupy, who has about two more weeks, had expressed frustration with a lack of town guidance, said Chipman.
The town's administrative assistant, charged with staff management, quit last year. Paul Bird, the replacement, will start work next month.
Potvin has offered to continue working part time until the town settles on a warden plan, Chipman said.

Abstract: AUGUSTA - Despite warnings that the state cannot absorb the $60 million-per-year cost, the Maine House on Thursday approved a bill to allow pension and retirement benefits to be exempted from state income taxes. The bill, which received preliminary approval and was sent to the Senate, would exempt the first $25,000 per person, or $44,000 for couples filing jointly, in pension and retirement benefits starting in January 2000.

"It's a terrific idea. But it does not pass the threshold test of what is possible," Rep. Patrick Colwell, D-Gardiner, said during a debate.
The bill, which received preliminary approval and was sent to the Senate, would exempt the first $25,000 per person, or $44,000 for couples filing jointly, in pension and retirement benefits starting in January 2000.
House rejects shellfish sales bill
AUGUSTA --- Maine clam diggers will get to keep selling their harvests directly to restaurants and steamer stands along the coastal highways unless lawmakers change course on a bill they rejected Thursday.
The House of Representatives soundly defeated a bill that would require clam, quahog and other shellfish harvesters to sell only to certified wholesale dealers or directly to consumers, but not to restaurants.
Senate sets aside referendum change
AUGUSTA --- The timing of a "people's veto" referendum on a gay- rights law passed by the Legislature inspired a bill that was temporarily shelved by the Maine Senate on Thursday.
Senators set aside a proposed constitutional amendment requiring that referendums on newly passed laws be held at the next regularly scheduled election, not at a special election.
Voters repealed Maine's newly enacted gay rights law in February 1998. Critics said the special election cost Maine municipalities hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Abstract: A South Portland fisherman who wants to raise mussels in Casco Bay is seeking permission to set up part of the operation in Portland Harbor. Tollef Olson hopes to lease an area just off Martin's Point in Portland so he can anchor rafts for collecting mussel seed, or larvae. The baby mussels collected there would be grown to market size at another proposed lease site near Cheabeague and Bangs islands. The Board of Harbor Commissioners is holding a public hearing tonight on the Martin's Point proposal. In addition to his state aquaculture lease, Olson needs a commission permit to place raft moorings in the harbor. The meeting starts at 5 p.m. in the Council Chamber at South Portland City Hall.

Full text: A South Portland fisherman who wants to raise mussels in Casco Bay is seeking permission to set up part of the operation in Portland Harbor.
Tollef Olson hopes to lease an area just off Martin's Point in Portland so he can anchor rafts for collecting mussel seed, or larvae. The baby mussels collected there would be grown to market size at another proposed lease site near Cheabeague and Bangs islands.
The Board of Harbor Commissioners is holding a public hearing tonight on the Martin's Point proposal. In addition to his state aquaculture lease, Olson needs a commission permit to place raft moorings in the harbor. The meeting starts at 5 p.m. in the Council Chamber at South Portland City Hall.
Olson, 43, has fished for urchins, lobsters and tuna and worked as a salvage diver around the world. He said he sees aquaculture as the future because wild resources get fished out. "There's a lot of competition for the natural resources now. I would just as soon grow my own," he said.
There has not yet been any opposition to the Portland Harbor plan, though some lobstermen have objected to Olson's application to lease about two acres west of Bangs Island, saying that area is heavily used for trapping lobsters. Both leases are still pending.
"There's some resistance," Olson said. "A lot of people are for it. The writing's on the wall."
A few more remote spots in Casco Bay already are leased by the state for aquaculture, but fish and shellfish farming is far more common along the Down East coast. Lease applications often lead to territorial fights with lobstermen and other fishermen.
The proposed Portland Harbor site is about 650 feet long and 50 to 100 feet wide, or a little more than one acre. The Bangs Island site is about two acres.
"I can't say it won't interfere with fishing," Olson said. "You try to put it in a place where they will interfere the least. There aren't any traps at that particular spot."
Olson, who calls his company Aqua Farms, is one of a group of entrepreneurs trying out new mussel farming techniques.
Olson plans to anchor three marked rafts at the Portland site and hang long ropes down through the water. The seed mussels will drift into the ropes and attach, as they do to piers and rocks. The mussels will be taken off and placed inside long mesh sleeves and suspended beneath the rafts moored near Bangs Island. It will take them about 18 months to grow to market size, he said.
Olson is seeking experimental two-year leases to see if the sites will work. The experimental mussel farms could become part of an aquaculture network to supply Great Eastern Mussel Farm at Tenants Harbor in St. George.
"If it's successful," Olson said, "then it's a sustainable fishery."

SUSAN'S DOES SEAFOOD -- AND SIDE DISHES -- TO PERFECTION

Abstract: Susan's Fish & Chips proves that succulent fried seafood isn't just a summertime treat. Both of Susan's restaurants -- on Forest Avenue in Portland and Ocean Street in South Portland -- offer dining on-premises or take-out. Susan Eklund has been serving treats from the sea since 1990, the year she opened her Forest Avenue restaurant. The South Portland location has been open for three years. Eating at Susan's is an informal experience. The South Portland restaurant is one small room lined with six booths. The tables and booths are made of pine. Tabletop lights, featuring a small ship's wheel, light each booth. Art work and collectibles -- all sea-related -- decorate the walls and surfaces. Seashells and lobsters are favored objects. A corner of the room near the front window holds a collection of toys to keep children occupied. Soon, heaping plates of golden, fried food arrived at our table. I ordered the day's special, oysters ($7.95). About 15 large, tender oysters were presented on a plate that also held french-fried potatoes and homemade coleslaw. The oysters were hot, juicy and delightfully enrobed in Susan's batter, which is a cross between traditional puffy batter and the crunchier crumb batter. Delivered to the table was a Ball canning jar filled with a tangy homemade tarter sauce. Cocktail sauce and lemon wedges were also served.

Susan's Fish & Chips proves that succulent fried seafood isn't just a summertime treat. Both of Susan's restaurants -- on Forest Avenue in Portland and Ocean Street in South Portland -- offer dining on-premises or take-out. Susan Eklund has been serving treats from the sea since 1990, the year she opened her Forest Avenue restaurant. The South Portland location has been open for three years.
Eating at Susan's is an informal experience. The South Portland restaurant is one small room lined with six booths. The tables and booths are made of pine. Tabletop lights, featuring a small ship's wheel, light each booth. Art work and collectibles -- all sea-related -- decorate the walls and surfaces. Seashells and lobsters are favored objects. A corner of the room near the front window holds a collection of toys to keep children occupied.
There is no table service for ordering, though food is delivered to your table when it's ready. We stepped up to the counter and placed our order after reading the selections posted on the wall. A printed takeout menu is available.
The menu is divided into dinners ($4.95 to $14.95), sandwiches ($1.95 to $7.95), fried seafood by the pint or quart ($6.95 to $15.95) and chowder, sides and soft drinks, (65 cents to $3.95). A special or two is offered daily.
To begin, I ordered fish chowder ($1.95 small, $3.95 large). The soup selection changes daily and includes clam, lobster and oyster stew. Susan's makes each batch daily, and it was delicious, with the perfect balance of milk and butter. It was not greasy or heavy, and it was jammed with haddock and nice-sized chunks of potatoes and onions. It was seasoned lightly with pepper, and it was heavy on the salt in the way a chowder can be without suffering for it. It was one of the best renditions I've had.
We also ordered the crab meat roll special ($6.50) as an appetizer. A fresh, untoasted bun arrived loaded with crab meat and just enough mayonnaise to hold the meat together, sitting on top of a bed of fresh lettuce. It was a winning combination.
Soon, heaping plates of golden, fried food arrived at our table. I ordered the day's special, oysters ($7.95). About 15 large, tender oysters were presented on a plate that also held french-fried potatoes and homemade coleslaw. The oysters were hot, juicy and delightfully enrobed in Susan's batter, which is a cross between traditional puffy batter and the crunchier crumb batter. Delivered to the table was a Ball canning jar filled with a tangy homemade tarter sauce. Cocktail sauce and lemon wedges were also served.
The french fries were hand-cut. They had a nice color and were crisp on the outside, hot with a good texture on the inside. Ketchup, malt vinegar and hot sauce were all available as accompaniments to the fries.
The coleslaw -- one of my favorite foods -- was terrific. It consisted of fine diced cabbage, grated carrot, lots of black pepper, celery salt and onion salt. It was a zingy dressing. The pepper and salts are what set this version apart from milder kinds.
Susan's gets its seafood delivered four times a week from local fishermen, which undoubtedly helped make the seafood platter ($14.95) so good. This gigantic mound of food included scallops, hunks of haddock, clams and shrimp. All of it was very good, but the scallops were outstanding. They were soft and incredibly sweet. The clams were tender. The shrimp had the mildest of flavors. The haddock was a showy, snowy white. All the seafood was enhanced by the crumb batter. The combination plate, like all the dinners, came with fries and coleslaw.
We also sampled the homemade onion rings. These were beautiful and quite crunchy but were lacking in onion flavor. I asked about the variety of onion used and was told that they had been having problems with the onions they were receiving.
Other dinners include fish and chips ($4.95), calamari ($5.95), chicken ($5.95), trout ($5.95), scallops ($9.95), shrimp ($7.95) and clam ($9.95). Sandwiches include lobster roll ($7.95), clam and shrimp rolls ($4.95 each), reubens ($4.50), and hamburgers, cheeseburgers and hot dogs ($1.95/$2.05/95 cents).
Dessert is limited to ice-cream cones (94 cents), frappes ($1.90) and our choice, deep-fried ice cream ($2.75). A generous scoop of vanilla ice cream was rolled in a special batter, deep frozen, and lowered into the fryer for 15 seconds. It emerged with a crunchy exterior and was covered in hot fudge sauce. The finishing touch was a topping of whipped cream. The chewy texture -- like corn flakes -- was unusual. It was a combination that grew on me as I ate it. The sauce and whipped cream were both good.
Our bill, before tax, tip or drinks, was $38.

Full text: ABOUT THE AUTHOR Ned Sullivan is the commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
As I prepare to leave my post as Maine's commissioner of environmental protection on April 1, I want to issue a final report to Maine's people on how far we have come.
Compliance with Maine's environmental laws has clearly improved in recent years. Right now, Maine's wastewater treatment plants are operating 97 percent of the time within license limits. Licensed air emission sources operate in compliance 89 percent of the time. Compliance with natural resources permits-by-rule exceeds 80 percent.
IT'S IMPORTANT to recognize that we have achieved all of this through a multifaceted initiative involving education, technical assistance and traditional enforcement action. We have made effective use of each tool, despite a recently published article saying that enforcement is "down."
In fact, both cases resolved and fines imposed have gone up in the last three years. Penalties paid by violators in fiscal year '98 -- totaling $1.7 million -- were 39 per cent higher than in fiscal year 1995, the last year of Gov. John McKernan's tenure.
During this period, the Department of Environmental Protection imposed a penalty of almost $800,000 on one company and required an additional $1.2 million in remedial expenditures. In another case, a fine of $220,000 was imposed, the largest ever under the Natural Resources Protection Act.
During the last two years, the department went to court and won two criminal cases with two individuals serving jail time. The last time this happened was 1993.
Whether one wishes to characterize these figures as good news or bad, they tell us little about the thing we most care about at the DEP -- whether our policies are resulting in a measurable improvement in the quality of Maine's environment.
During the past few years, regulators in Maine and other parts of the country have moved beyond measuring their success in terms of fines imposed. Instead they have begun gathering and analyzing field data that indicate whether pollution released to the environment is declining and ecosytem health is improving.
These are the true measures of our success, the raison d'etre of our regulatory and nonregulatory initiatives.
DURING HIS first term, Gov. King set forth more than a dozen aggressive, measurable environmental goals in a major environmental speech at The Maine Audubon Society's Gilsland Farm in Falmouth. He challenged the regulated community, citizens and state government to work together to achieve those goals. Two months ago, the governor returned to Gilsland Farm and gave a report card on progress toward the goals. Here are some of the results:
In his first-term speech, Gov. King said he wanted to see ground- level ozone pollution reduced below the federal standard by 1999. This year the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced that the goal had been achieved.
King said he wanted the number of unlined town dumps properly closed to reach 332 by January 2000. The figure he reported in February 1999 was 345.
KING HAD CALLED for removal of 30,000 obsolete underground petroleum storage tanks by 1999. Notably, 33,000, or more than 99 percent of known underground tanks, have been removed and replaced with state-of- the-art facilities.
He set a goal of opening 25,000 acres of shellfish beds to harvesting by the year 2000. In fact, 50,000 acres have been opened.
King had called for a 30 percent reduction in the use of extremely toxic substances in Maine business. While only a 20 percent reduction has been achieved, this represents a whopping 97 million pounds of these dangerous chemicals eliminated from Maine workplaces.
Each of these represents real measurable progress in our effort to improve Maine's environment. Collectively, they embody the commitment and collaboration of Maine state government, the business community, federal and municipal agencies, and Maine citizens and advocacy groups, utilizing a full range of traditional and innovative tools to achieve a common goal.
I believe that Maine people care most about measurable environmental progress. For more information on the health of Maine's environment, visit the DEP's web site at (www.state.me.us/dep) or call the Maine Environmental Priorities Council for a copy of the 1998 State of the Environment Report (822-6425).

STONEWALL KITCHEN COOKS UP TEMPTING BOXED CAKE MIXES

Abstract: Boxed cake mixes are so passe they don't even rate as retro comfort food. I hadn't picked one up since I cut my culinary teeth on a boxed version of Boston Cream Pie when I was 10. That cake was a success even though I dropped it putting it into the oven and it landed upside down on the oven door. By high school, though, I'd figured out that cake mixes really didn't save all that much time for what you were trading in flavor. Still, I was intrigued by Stonewall Kitchen's gourmet boxed cake mixes that came out last fall. Stonewall Kitchen in York makes some of the best jams and condiments I've ever had. They are also master packagers. Try walking through their store in Portland's Old Port without picking up one of those beautiful jars of jam or a lovely bottle of vinegar. So after years of self-righteously marching past the Duncan Hines cake mixes at the grocery store, I found myself opening a box to make a cake. I tried both the Blueberry Sour Cream Coffee Cake and the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cake mixes. Stonewall also sells mixes for Spiced Buttermilk Scones and Coconut Almond Lemon Bars.

So after years of self-righteously marching past the Duncan Hines cake mixes at the grocery store, I found myself opening a box to make a cake. I tried both the Blueberry Sour Cream Coffee Cake and the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Cake mixes. Stonewall also sells mixes for Spiced Buttermilk Scones and Coconut Almond Lemon Bars.
Each mix includes a jar of jam or, in the case of the lemon bars, lemon curd. They sell for $10 each, which is a lot more than a grocery store mix, but consider that each mix includes a $6.50 jar of jam.
Each cake was yummy. The coffee cake was rich and buttery with a gooey blueberry middle. The truffle cake was dense and fudgy with just a hint of raspberry. Unfortunately, the seeds distracted from the smooth texture. Clearly, these cakes are much more gourmet than your average mix, and each recipe leaves you some jam for your morning toast.
For the sour cream coffee cake, I had to add and cream my own butter as well as mix in my own eggs. All the mix saved me was measuring and sifting the dry ingredients.
As for time, well, you're saving maybe five to 15 minutes, but you aren't sacrificing any flavor or texture. As tasty as these cakes were, I came to the same conclusion I did way back when: Boxed cakes aren't big time-savers.
Stonewall's mixes, however, would be handy for the non-baker who needs to come up with a delicious sweet or for any cook to keep on hand for an emergency dessert situation. But then, for not too much more money, you could pick up dessert at a local bakery, say Port Bake House on Commercial Street.
The bakers among you can get the recipe for Stonewall's coffee cake in this month's issue of Food and Wine and make it from scratch.
Treats from Spain
Norine Kotts and Cheryl Lewis, owners of Aurora Provisions on Pine Street, are just back from a 10-day tour of sunny Spain, and it shows. The twosome has added an array of tapas and Spanish cheese to their takeout counter and have some new Spanish wines on the shelves.
The tapas -- essentially the Spanish word for hors d'oeuvres -- include Moorish mussels, a fabulous combination of the bivalves with a smoky sauce of cilantro, chili peppers, parsley, olive oil, cayenne and red pepper.
There are also pork and chicken empanadas; slices of tortilla espagnol, basically a frittata made with sliced potatoes folded into an egg batter; and Catabrian Coast tuna balls, made with tuna, hard- boiled eggs and onion and simmered in chicken stock and wine.
The cheeses include manchaego, a hard sheep's milk cheese that is traditionally served in a small triangle with a dab of quince paste, as well as a buttery blue and, my favorite, Montebro, which has a zippy aftertaste.
Spanish wines have really improved in the past 10 years, and the prices are reasonable. The Martin Codax 1997 Albarino ($10.99) is a dry, crisp white that would pair well with seafood. The Finac Retuerta 1997 Rivola ($10.99) has a great spicy flavor that will appeal to fans of red Zinfandels.
Across the Casco Bay Bridge at the Snow Squall, Jane Tabor StGermain has concocted her own slice of sunshine, an orange citrus tart made from layers of mousse made with blood orange curd and sponge cake nestled into a sweet dough crust.
"I don't usually toot my own horn, but it's really yummy," StGermain says.
StGermain was formerly pastry chef at the Port Bake House, where she specialized in fresh fruit tarts and tiramisu. Last summer she joined her husband, John, at the Snow Squall. He is the chef there.
Since then, Jane has updated the restaurant's dessert menu. Instead of the standard carrot cake, look for cranberry Linzertorte or white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.
She also recently started baking sourdough bread for the restaurant. Her almond croissants, muffins and Danish pastries are on the Sunday brunch menu. She and her husband teamed up on a three- onion tart. They are thinking of maybe doing bread bowls for gazpacho this summer.
Life with no restaurant
For those of you wondering what happened to Martha and James Williamson, who sold the Madd Apple Cafe this winter, well, they are lying low these days.
The twosome is doing some private catering and free-lancing for local restaurants. They hope to eventually buy a building the Portland area and open another restaurant. For now, though, they are enjoying eating out on Friday and Saturday nights after 12 years of working on the weekends.

Abstract: Robins have already heralded the return of warmth and light to our northern territories. This weekend, the sun confirms that spring is on its way by equally balancing night and day. It's the vernal equinox, the start of spring. There's a lot more to see and do on the peninsula, reached by a drive down Route 130. On the same road, due west of New Harbor, is the Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site, where archaeologists have dug up the remains of an early settlement. From the early inhabitants who built there, to the archaeologists who figured it out, to the celebrities who so recently took over the region to film "Message in a Bottle," it's a fascinating visit. Look for stories of the early inhabitants written on signs around the mounds. Though the museum and fort are not open at this time, the fun, walking areas are.

Full text: Donna Gold of Stockton Springs is the author of several guides to Maine, including "Country Towns of Maine."
Robins have already heralded the return of warmth and light to our northern territories. This weekend, the sun confirms that spring is on its way by equally balancing night and day. It's the vernal equinox, the start of spring.
We can't welcome spring with crocuses plucked from our lawns or even pussy willows pulled from the woods, but Maine offers plenty of other ways to celebrate.
How about a leisurely drive down one of the state's prettiest peninsulas, followed by a rip-roaring visit to the ocean?
Pemaquid Point's bare rocks, spouting surf and classic lighthouse, is a perfect place to welcome spring. Wear green, toss a clump of snow into the ocean and send winter packing with warm thoughts as you clamber over Pemaquid's dramatic rock shelf that plunges from land to sea. Finish with a meal of eggs at a local restaurant (pink roe, scraped from inside a lobster will do).
There's a lot more to see and do on the peninsula, reached by a drive down Route 130. On the same road, due west of New Harbor, is the Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site, where archaeologists have dug up the remains of an early settlement. From the early inhabitants who built there, to the archaeologists who figured it out, to the celebrities who so recently took over the region to film "Message in a Bottle," it's a fascinating visit. Look for stories of the early inhabitants written on signs around the mounds. Though the museum and fort are not open at this time, the fun, walking areas are.
On the other side of St. John's Bay (from Route 130 take the Old Harrington Road from Route 130 and turn south on Route 129), lies South Bristol. It's a charming fishing village made enchanting by the swing bridge that spans a cut known as The Gut. Though the bridge doesn't move quite so much in winter or spring, you might just be lucky enough to watch it swing.
Perhaps, though, you'd rather watch boats from the safety of a park bench. Upriver in Damariscotta, you can buy a sandwich in one of several stores, take it to the park at the head of the Damariscotta River, and watch the traffic.
Another way of celebrating spring is to waltz into a soda fountain and order an ice cream soda. In Damariscotta, you can do that twice, at S. Fernald's Country Store or at Waltz's Pharmacy. Kick your legs and swing on the stools and remember how special spring is to children, too.
So take them to the playground on Route 1B, or up to Round Top Center for the Arts, where a show of children's artwork is hanging. Even kids who tremble at the word museum enjoy seeing work that they and their friends could have done.
Need one more reason to visit the area? Try the Damariscotta River Association's visitor center, Salt Bay Farm Heritage Center on Belvedere Road (from Route 1, turn left at the yellow blinking light, 563-1393). Beyond the building, hiking trails lead to oyster middens left by Native Americans in ancient times. While there, bid adieu to the Barrow's goldeneyes headed for the northland as the robins, finches and light return.
For more information about the region call the Damariscotta Region Chamber of Commerce at 563-8340.
DIRECTIONS: Take 295 to I-95 to Brunswick and Route 1 to Damariscotta.

The bottom line: Chances are you're familiar with Chowderhead's in Scarborough. Now there's a Chowderhead's for folks north of Portland.
The restaurant is in the Yarmouth Marketplace, where there's plenty of room to park. We could almost feel the sea breeze as we walked in. Colorful fish adorn the blue walls of the bright, spacious dining room with its 17 blue, chrome-trimmed tables with chairs to match. We placed our orders, were given a number and soon were toting trays with hot seafood to our table.
I delved into fish and chips ($5.25), as my companion dipped into a bowl of seafood chowder ($3.45) along with a side order of homemade onion rings ($2.50).
The fish and chips consisted of moist, fresh haddock, fried to perfection, in a light, crispy batter. It came with a wedge of lemon and a choice of French fries, cole slaw, onion rings, pasta salad or rice pilaf. I had gone with the cole slaw, which was fresh and crunchy but a tad runny.
The chowder was tasty, but it could have used a little more scallops, shrimp and fish, and a bit less salt. The onion rings were great.
Other offerings include an array of fried seafood dinners ($4.95 to $10.95 for the small portions), swordfish steak sandwich and salmon steak sandwich (both $5.25), grilled teriyaki chicken breast ($5.50) and fried chicken ($6.95), plus a good selection of sandwiches and subs ($2.20 to $7.50).

Abstract: The Town Council voted unanimously Tuesday to sue the state and a private shellfish company if negotiations fail to give the public the right to rake clams at a saltwater lake. Town attorney Geoffrey Hole told the council that he has already filed a complaint in Cumberland County Superior Court to preserve the town's right to go to court. But Hole said he hopes instead to reach a settlement with Spinney Creek Shellfish in Eliot and Andrew Johnson, a man who works with the company. Each won 10-year leases from the state last month to raise clams on 60 acres of a dammed ocean inlet known locally as the New Meadows Lake. The inlet is on the border of West Bath and Brunswick.

Full text: The Town Council voted unanimously Tuesday to sue the state and a private shellfish company if negotiations fail to give the public the right to rake clams at a saltwater lake.
"I want to vigorously pursue our rights with piranha-like diligence," Faith Moll, the council's vice chairwoman, said before the vote.
Town attorney Geoffrey Hole told the council that he has already filed a complaint in Cumberland County Superior Court to preserve the town's right to go to court. But Hole said he hopes instead to reach a settlement with Spinney Creek Shellfish in Eliot and Andrew Johnson, a man who works with the company.
Each won 10-year leases from the state last month to raise clams on 60 acres of a dammed ocean inlet known locally as the New Meadows Lake. The inlet is on the border of West Bath and Brunswick.
"It seems that with 60 acres and 10 years at stake we would be willing to pursue this case," said Hole, adding that West Bath has also filed a complaint.
Representatives from both towns have called the leasing unjust. Despite those objections, the state's Marine Resource Department believes it has the authority to grant private leases to clam- producing ocean water that does not drop to mud when the tide pulls out.
Brunswick and West Bath, which manage public digging on tidal shores, had protested because they had made efforts to clean the lake for locally licensed diggers. Septic-system discharges that had fouled the water have been stopped and water tests have shown improvement.
The 10-year leases to most of the lake above Route 1 infuriated and disappointed clam committees in both towns.
The state commissioner of marine resources explained that state law required that he allow private clam farming at the lake because the proposals were well presented and there was no good reason to say no.
One of the winners of a lease -- Tom Howell of Spinney Creek -- has already begun talking about reducing the size of his area, said Jack Lemont, chairman of the Brunswick clam committee.
Local unhappiness with state leasing also sparked a move to change state law. A public hearing has been scheduled at the State House next week on a bill sponsored by Sen. Phil Harriman, R-Yarmouth. The hearing will begin at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday
The proposal would give towns veto power of lease proposals within their borders.
Also at Tuesday's meeting, the council unanimously agreed to allow the town manager to negotiate with the Bath-Brunswick Child Care Center.
The non-profit agency has been renting a 200-year-old farmhouse from the town and would like to renovate it and build an addition. The town must decide whether to rent or sell the property at 44 Water St. and whether to include a quarter of an acre next to it.

Council to vote on suing state over clams
Heavy snowfall prompted the town manager to postpone Monday's meeting of the Town Council until tonight.
The council will be asked at the 7:30 p.m. meeting to consider whether to sue the state for its recent decision to allow a private shellfish company to farm clams on a leased portion of the New Meadows Lake, which is a dammed ocean inlet on the Brunswick-West Bath border.
The town objects to the lease, even though the owner of Spinney Creek Shellfish Co. has offered to shrink his proposed farming operation from 30 acres to five.
Faith Moll, the council vice chairman, said she opposes the leasing because she disagrees with the state's claim that it controls the rights to the lake. "I have always felt very aggressive about this," said Moll. "I just felt we should be the ones to control this."
The council has also been scheduled to discuss the Bath-Brunswick Child Care Center in an old farmhouse on Water Street. The non-profit agency has been leasing the building from the town. It now has plans to renovate and build an addition, and the council must decide whether to offer a long-term lease or to sell the property.
BATH
Megabucks winner keeps identity secret
The Maine State Lottery Commission announced Monday that the winner of a $2.9 million Megabucks jackpot will not be coming forward to claim the prize.
Deputy Director Pamela Coutts said the commission instead mailed a check for $79,730 to The Sierra Trust of Bath. Carl Stinson, a Bath attorney, will serve as the fund's trustee.
"That's all we know about the winner," Coutts said.
Coutts said the Lottery Commission likes to advertise its winners because it makes the game more enticing to Megabucks players. However, commission rules allow winners to form trusts to manage their prize money.
Stinson said his client, a woman, chose to form the trust to protect her privacy. She purchased the winning ticket from Ernie Back's variety store in Bath on Dec. 13, entitling her to the Dec. 16 game's entire jackpot. The prize money will be paid out annually in 25 installments.
Stinson said his client waited three months to claim the Megabucks prize because she "just wanted the dust to settle a bit and put some distance between the event."
"The beneficiary seeks total anonymity," Stinson said. "It can get to be a hassle. She is very protective of her privacy."
BOWDOINHAM
Hearing to discuss Town Hall addition
Selectmen will hold a public hearing Wednesday on a proposal to renovate the 173-year-old Town Hall. The hearing will begin at 7 p.m in the Coomb's Municipal Building, 13 School St.
Town Manager Earla Haggerty said the town will use a $55,000 federal Community Development block grant to build an addition to the former church. The addition would include a vestibule, an outdoor porch and a handicapped-accessible rest room. Inside, a handicapped lift would be installed next to the stage area.
Haggerty said the town hopes that the renovations will restore the building to its former splendor, making it a more inviting place for summer theater performances and winter concerts. The Town Hall, which has primarily been used for contra dances, has a seating capacity of 250.
Some town funds and private contributions would have to be used to fund the $85,000 project. But Haggerty said nearly all the local funds have been raised. Bowdoinham's municipal building -- known as the Coomb's Municipal Building -- is separate from the Town Hall. The two buildings are about 150 feet apart.
"It's exciting to see the interest that this project has generated," Haggerty said. The project was designed by John Hansen, a Thomaston architect.

GREAT SCALLOPS, WINTER: CAN'T HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER

Abstract: I know everyone likes to shish-kabob them on the grill come summer, but it's the deep of winter when you should be eating these yummy bivalves. The in-shore season closes April 15. Until then, boats are bringing Maine sea scallops in the same day they caught them. In the summer, fisherman have to go out much farther into the ocean, a minimum of three miles, to fish them, so the scallops are packed in the preservative polytriphosphate, says Rod Mitchell at Browne Trading Company, a Portland fish wholesaler. The preservative bloats them with water. It also makes them an unnatural, virginal white. Sam Hayward, chef and co-owner of Fore Street, takes scallops off the menu in the summer. The scallops are so plumbed with water that when you throw them on the barbecue you are actually steaming them rather than grilling them, he says. And if you try to saute them, you'll end up with a watery mess. On occasion, a diver shows up at Fore Street in the summertime with a bag full of fresh scallops, and that's the only time you'll find them on the menu in the hot months.

Full text:   Most people are thinking just a few weeks to the end of winter. I'm thinking just a few weeks left in the scallop season.
I know everyone likes to shish-kabob them on the grill come summer, but it's the deep of winter when you should be eating these yummy bivalves. The in-shore season closes April 15. Until then, boats are bringing Maine sea scallops in the same day they caught them.
In the summer, fisherman have to go out much farther into the ocean, a minimum of three miles, to fish them, so the scallops are packed in the preservative polytriphosphate, says Rod Mitchell at Browne Trading Company, a Portland fish wholesaler. The preservative bloats them with water. It also makes them an unnatural, virginal white.
Sam Hayward, chef and co-owner of Fore Street, takes scallops off the menu in the summer. The scallops are so plumbed with water that when you throw them on the barbecue you are actually steaming them rather than grilling them, he says. And if you try to saute them, you'll end up with a watery mess. On occasion, a diver shows up at Fore Street in the summertime with a bag full of fresh scallops, and that's the only time you'll find them on the menu in the hot months.
"I hate scallops in the summer," Hayward says. "They have off- odors and off-colors."
But right now, they are still at their best. Fresh scallops are ivory, beige, even pinkish, and they are not bathed in juice. Even during the winter, some fisherman use the preservative, because it makes their scallops heavier, thus more expensive. If you have any doubts, ask your fishmonger for "dry" scallops.
Scallops are low in fat and easy to cook. The danger is overcooking them into rubbery plugs. Master chef Madeleine Kamman suggests in "The New Making of a Cook" searing large scallops quickly over high heat in a non-stick skillet rubbed with a paper towel lightly saturated with the oil of your choice. Sear the first side to golden, about two minutes depending on size, turn it over and season, and sear it on the second side. This way, the center will be warm but not cooked through. If you want it cooked a little more, press down on the scallops with a spatula for about 30 seconds per side. Just squeeze on some lemon juice.
PAINLESS WAYS TO GET A TABLE: Speaking of Fore Street, three years after opening, it's still one of the hottest restaurants in town. A common complaint among my friends is that they tried to get a reservation for Saturday night at the restaurant but couldn't. So here's the skinny on how far in advance to call, and what to do if you can't get a reservation.
Hayward suggests calling a week in advance to get a reservation for prime dining hours (7 and 7:30 p.m.) on Saturdays. If you can eat early or late, call between the Tuesday and Thursday before the Saturday. Now, say you spaced it or decided at the last minute that you have to have a pan of Hayward's unbelievable mussels with hazelnuts. Don't give up. Fore Street holds about a third of its tables open for walk-ins. So even if they are booked solid with reservations, there are still tables to be had. Again, your best bet is to go really early (they start seating at 5:30 p.m.) or really late (after 8:30 p.m.).
If you make a reservation at any restaurant, for God's sake call and cancel it if you change your mind. You should also call back if the number in your party has changed. Hayward says no-shows in Maine are chronic. That really hurts restaurants, which all teeter on thin profit lines. While a restaurant holds a table for a deadbeat, they have to turn other patrons away.
Big-city restaurants avoid this by requiring that people make reservations with their credit card or they purposely overbook reservations. Some restaurants in Maine -- Aubergine, for example, -- deal with the problem by taking reservations only for six or more people at the start of the evening. If you want a lively restaurant scene, don't abuse this service.
STANDARD BAKING'S ON THE MOVE: After four years in their cozy but cramped quarters on Wharf Street, Matt James and Alison Pray are moving Standard Baking to much larger digs, where Nappi's Pizza and Pool is on Commercial Street, under Fore Street. The bread bakery plans to move April 1.
In the new location, the bakery is installing a $50,000, 10-ton gas-fired oven with a brick base. They've been using the electric ovens on Wharf Street to the max for the past four years, turning out as many as 500 baguettes on some days. Not only will they be able to make lots more bread, but James expects the new oven will make their bread's quality more consistent. "The steam injection is better, and we'll have more control over the process," James says.
So prepare for the best baguette in town to get even better.
James and Pray, who co-own the bakery with restaurateur Dana Street, also plan to try out a few more breads in their new home. By late June or early July, they may have a pain rustica, another kind of rye and maybe something with corn on the shelves. They'll also have more room to do brioche, tarts, croissants and my favorite, the morning buns with walnuts.
The bakery plans to remain open through the move. They may hold on to the Wharf Street location too, and they might put a seating area in their new shop.

PRESSURE TO OPEN SCALLOPING WILL HURT GROUNDFISH SEN. KENNEDY'S PUSH VIOLATES A WELL-THOUGHT-OUT MANAGEMENT PLAN.

Abstract: That, anyway, seems to be the philosophy guiding U.S. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley in trying to strong-arm New England's fisheries managers into reopening parts of Georges Bank to scallopers by mid-June. The "emergency" to which the secretary has responded is a political one. Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy told him he needed to act --and fast. The closed area now overflows with scallops, and fishermen (his constituents) would like to dredge for dollars. But Washington politics is a poor substitute for hands-on science. And it is an especially bad proxy for the regional New England Fishery Management Council process that -- ironically -- plans to open the Georges Bank scalloping beds in early July, just two weeks later.

But Washington politics is a poor substitute for hands-on science. And it is an especially bad proxy for the regional New England Fishery Management Council process that -- ironically -- plans to open the Georges Bank scalloping beds in early July, just two weeks later.
The flap, unfortunately, involves more than a case of bureaucratic bad manners. It seriously undermines a regional, hands-on system that is addressing, albeit slowly, the tragedy of overfishing that has beset our common fishery resources.
At a fully sustainable level, recovered New England fisheries would pump hundreds of millions of additional dollars into the region's economy.
But it will be hard to make that happen with Washington tipping the scales.
Sen. Kennedy's ill-placed pressure to re-open these new scallop beds -- nurtured back from decimation after being closed to groundfishing four years ago -- is a textbook example of why we need a regional process to find a solution that works locally for all the fisheries.
A mid-June date is excellent for weddings, but not for fish. That's because this is the end of the spawning season for another important and grossly overexploited resource on Georges Bank -- cod and other species of groundfish.
Dredging for scallops involves towing metal sleds along the ocean bottom, with bags attached that are fashioned out of heavy chain link mesh. Apart from the damage this gear may do to plants and animals on the sea floor, the procedure interferes with spawning.
Because cod and other groundfish congregate when they spawn, it makes it far easier for scallopers to accidentally catch and destroy fish while they drag for scallops. One recent study of yellowtail flounder estimated that the amount of this unwanted "bycatch" may actually equal the amount of scallop meat harvested.
Scallops, of course, are a resource, and no one is arguing that scalloping be halted. The issue is good and well-coordinated management. With the senator's sudden interest and the secretary's interference, that key ingredient is about to be jettisoned.
Already, the National Marine Fisheries Service -- the Commerce Department's fishing regulator -- has been directed to assess scallop recovery in two other large sections of the sea now off limits to boats that catch groundfish.
Presumably, if recovery has been substantial (and scallops can recover fast), those areas will be opened to scallopers as well.
Unfortunately, none of this feeding frenzy will get us where we need to go. That's because it won't tell us what we need to know.
The already-accelerated NMFS process needs to make provision to collect information essential to ensuring that recovering habitats and species aren't run over by the gold rush mentality that can drive the harvest of a newly revitalized resource like scallops. Otherwise, we will be right back where we started from.
At the very least, programs to collect information that improve fishery management -- for example, habitat and bycatch studies -- need to be part of any plan to reopen closed areas like the ones on Georges Bank.
The secretary's mid-June date is consistent with none of this. It is a creature of politics, not science. And it will not promote local cooperation.
Scallops are the first of a series of recovering fisheries that we expect to see in the years ahead. As a result, this re-opening sets an important precedent.
Four years ago, a different secretary used his emergency authority to close large portions of Georges Bank to all vessels capable of catching the declining stocks of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder. But that action came at New England's request.
This time, it is an unwanted -- and unneeded -- gift from afar.

SOME FEAR ZONING WILL FORCE THEM TO SELL COASTAL LAND A BRUNSWICK TASK FORCE GRAPPLES WITH CHANGES TO PROTECT CLAMMING AREAS FROM POLLUTION.

Abstract: Dowling, who has signed a petition to protest zoning rules now being drafted, says he is a man of modest means. He doesn't want more rules to price him out of the 57 acres that have been in his wife's family since her father was a town blacksmith in the 1930s. His wife, Marthe [Dowling], likes to have picnics in a clearing beyond a small forest by Maquoit Bay. At least 40 different kinds of wildflowers grow by the clam flats in the meadow that Dowling keeps mowed with an old tractor. In the winter, his grandchildren love slipping and sliding in the snow. And so he is among the 53 people who have signed copies of a petition -- one is kept by the counter at Brooks Farm and Feed on Union Street -- asking the Zoning Ordinance Task Force to abolish the current coastal protection zone that begins at Pleasant Hill Road and goes south. It ends at the Mere Point peninsula that pokes into the ocean with Middle Bay on one side and Maquoit on the other.

Full text: Charles Dowling, a retired post office worker, thinks there is something almost un-American and anti-middle class about the town demand that houses by the ocean be built on five-acre lots.
When lots are made that big -- to limit the number of houses and, in turn, protect the seashore from pollution -- prices go up, rich people buy, and they build mansions that drive up property taxes for everyone else.
Dowling, who has signed a petition to protest zoning rules now being drafted, says he is a man of modest means. He doesn't want more rules to price him out of the 57 acres that have been in his wife's family since her father was a town blacksmith in the 1930s.
His wife, Marthe, likes to have picnics in a clearing beyond a small forest by Maquoit Bay. At least 40 different kinds of wildflowers grow by the clam flats in the meadow that Dowling keeps mowed with an old tractor. In the winter, his grandchildren love slipping and sliding in the snow.
Why should the wealthy, he asked, be the only ones who can afford to enjoy this? Not everyone wants to live away from such beauty and in the center of a town.
And so he is among the 53 people who have signed copies of a petition -- one is kept by the counter at Brooks Farm and Feed on Union Street -- asking the Zoning Ordinance Task Force to abolish the current coastal protection zone that begins at Pleasant Hill Road and goes south. It ends at the Mere Point peninsula that pokes into the ocean with Middle Bay on one side and Maquoit on the other.
This zone, designed to protect these clamming bays from pollution from septic systems, lawn fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides, has been under review by the task force in recent months. Town Planner Theo Holtwijk has suggested that the task force choose a lot size close to the current five-acre standard -- between three and five acres.
Committee members haven't yet decided what they will ask the council to approve, but they have spoken in favor of expanding the 6,000-acre zone beyond Pleasant Hill. Another 2,000 acres or so would include the entire watershed.
They also say they plan to tell residents who live there that they must pump sludge out of their septic tanks every three years to prevent neglected systems from sending waste into the bays. They have even thought about requiring an extra filter that could add $10,000 to the cost of new septic systems.
"I think they've got to slow down a little on the things they're coming up with," said Dowling, who has been attending the meetings with his wife. "It's going to make the land pricier, then ordinary people won't be able to afford to live here."
Town Councilor Eleanor Swanson lives on Mere Point and knows big lots push land prices up, but she says nothing can be done about that.
"I feel the five-acre zoning is probably too lenient," she said. "It's not even slowed them down. There's a mad rush to build," she said, citing new house construction throughout the coastal zone.
Swanson worked to develop the first set of coastal rules 10 years ago as the community was reacting to an algae bloom that probably was caused by too much nitrogen coming from too many untended septic systems. The nitrogen fed ocean algae, which overgrew and used up oxygen in the water. For weeks, suffocated sea worms, crabs, oysters and mussels rotted and stank.
Nitrogen from anywhere in the watershed, even miles from the shore, can travel through the groundwater to the ocean, feed algae and cause too much to grow, she said.
Critics, Dowling included, have been questioning nitrogen calculations presented by experts. These figures attempt to defend lot-size restrictions by counting houses now, estimating how many more could be built and how much nitrogen they all could produce. Those numbers are put together with how much of the nutrient the bays are estimated to hold and flush before a bloom is triggered.
Dowling said that even though he signed the petition to get rid of the zone, he doesn't mind having a town pollution-protection area, as long as lot sizes shrink to three acres and it is expanded to include the watershed.
The rules should more fairly apply to everyone who sends their dirty water to the ocean, he said. When the current coastal zone was developed in the early 1990s, it stopped at a road instead of a watershed line because including more land was unpopular.
It is a struggle for the Dowlings to pay their $3,200 in property taxes. Already, he gets a break of a few hundred dollars because of a new state exemption and because he is a veteran. He and his wife are 66 and they had both retired until Marthe went back to her job as a pharmacy bookkeeper to help pay the bills.
They don't want to give up their land with its sweeping view of the ocean.
"We like it the way it is. We like it open. Unfortunately the town isn't helping us," Marthe Dowling said.
Her family started out with 276 acres, and bit by bit land was sold as her parents needed money. She fears she may have to do the same to pay her taxes.
"We'd like to keep it for our children and grandchildren," she said. "The way it is now we won't be able to."

Abstract: It is now coming to Freeport. The proposed Everett Hill subdivision of Joe Wishcamper and partners is a sprawl in the heart of Freeport and it threatens to fundamentally change the character and quality of life of South Freeport village. THREE MAJOR issues are at work here: a sprawling development; the inadequacy of the current subdivision ordinance and the proposed development's inconsistency with the Town's Comprehensive Plan; and the need for Freeport to approve an up-to-date open space plan, impact fee and growth control program. First, preserving the character of Freeport: Over the course of planning board meetings numerous citizens have testified to the proposed adverse impacts of Everett Hill: septic contamination of wells, potential pollution of aquifers and clam flats, loss of wildlife habitat, storm water pollution, significant increase in vehicular traffic, and contour issues relating to ordinance requirements for slopes, fills and cuts.

Full text: ABOUT THE AUTHOR Amos S. Eno of South Freeport is director of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which funds conservation projects.
Sprawl has become a nationwide issue, from Vice President Al Gore's 2000 budget proposals to the front page of The New York Times (on Feb. 6). It has ruined landscapes from Santa Clarita Valley, Calif., to Levittown, N.Y.
Gov. King has identified sprawl as a priority Maine problem and is adjusting state priorities to discourage sprawl.
It is now coming to Freeport. The proposed Everett Hill subdivision of Joe Wishcamper and partners is a sprawl in the heart of Freeport and it threatens to fundamentally change the character and quality of life of South Freeport village.
THREE MAJOR issues are at work here: a sprawling development; the inadequacy of the current subdivision ordinance and the proposed development's inconsistency with the Town's Comprehensive Plan; and the need for Freeport to approve an up-to-date open space plan, impact fee and growth control program.
First, preserving the character of Freeport: Over the course of planning board meetings numerous citizens have testified to the proposed adverse impacts of Everett Hill: septic contamination of wells, potential pollution of aquifers and clam flats, loss of wildlife habitat, storm water pollution, significant increase in vehicular traffic, and contour issues relating to ordinance requirements for slopes, fills and cuts.
Our village is characterized by open space and relatively abundant wildlife. People enjoy pedestrian exercise and children pedal bikes throughout the town. Everett Hill represents an almost 100 percent increase in house starts for Freeport, an additional 80 vehicles in my estimation, to roads already congested by the new YMCA. Sewage disposal may threaten a principal aquifer and will impact Harraseekets' recovering shellfish beds.
The impact of 37 new half-million-dollar houses will be felt by less well to do and moderate income residents as the subdivision growth translates into higher taxes for the community.
Mr. Wishcamper knows all this. He values open space. He lives surrounded by the legacies of Mrs. L.M.C. Smith who bequeathed Mast Landing Sanctuary, Pettingill Farm and Wolfe's Neck State Park and Farm to the town, defining its open space and character today.
AS A long-time investor in conservation projects, I am appalled by this proposed development and by the myopic view of Mr. Wishcamper, whose development condemns critical open space to residential sprawl.
Second, ordinance compliance: At the last planning board meeting, Wishcamper told the planning board and the audience that his subdivision meets the ordinance requirements. He said that wildlife was not relevant and that his septic plan complied with the ordinance.
This is only part of the issue. The greater issue is that the ordinance is inadequate; it is not consistent with the comprehensive plan on open space protection, on wildlife, on community character and on sewage disposal.
Everett Hill is one of the largest residential developments in Freeport's recent history. Three public hearings amply demonstrated that a subdivision of this size, reviewed strictly through the prism of the ordinance, is inadequate; the development's potential impacts swamp the ordinance.
THE development does not comply with the town's comprehensive plan. There should be a moratorium on subdivision proposals until such time as the ordinance is updated to be consistent with the town's comprehensive plan, and an impact fee program and growth control program are instituted. Further, the open space plan needs to be approved before developments of this size are considered.
Third, as a national donor investing heavily in Maine ($17 million in grants) and in Freeport (open space and shellfish restoration), my organization has learned that our grants can only help those communities that want to help themselves.
We shall underwrite no further investments in Freeport until such time as a valid open space plan is approved by the town council and an impact fee program incorporated into the development approval process.
I would welcome the opportunity to reposition a small grant to The Conservancy for Freeport open space preservation to inaugurate a fund to preserve Everett Hill.
Freeport should address these issues before approving a sprawling development of this size and impact.

Abstract: To begin, I ordered the crispy packets of herbed goat cheese ($5.95). Two squares of flaky phyllo dough burst open when cut into, spilling their luscious contents -- pungent, warmed goat cheese with fragrant herbs. The packets were served on grilled vegetables -- zucchini, and red, green and yellow peppers. The whole affair was topped with a pile of frizzled leeks and was sitting in a pool of balsamic reduction. The flavor of the packets was so good that the reduction was a distraction. My companion ordered the lobster, scallop and sweet potato cakes with red pepper, scallions and lobster sauce ($6). Egg white served as binder for the two cakes. They were lightly pan-fried, too lightly. They were undercooked and mushy inside, and very sweet because of the grated sweet potato. They were served with a robust red pepper and lobster sauce. A small salad of greens, onions and carrot was also on the plate. For an entree, I ordered one of the evening's specials, Maine shrimp and scallops in a curry cream sauce ($16.95). It was served with jasmine and black sticky rice. I obviously missed something when the description of this dish was read to me. I was surprised to find a plate filled with fruit --- kiwi, star fruit, red and green grapes, two kinds of melon --- mixed in with the seafood. My companion was as surprised as I was by the combination set before me. The scallops were plentiful but overcooked. There were just too many things happening on this plate.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
David's Restaurant at Middle and Market streets in Portland is an oasis of big-city sophistication.
A stylish glass and wood bar faces Middle Street, complete with a raw oyster bar and an extensive wine selection. The dining room is on two floors, one next to the bar and the other downstairs.
David's, which opened in 1993, recently underwent a menu transformation. David Turin, the owner and chef, describes his menu as creative and a bit risky. The restaurant's tag line now reads "metropolitan cuisine and wine bar."
With all the build-up, I have to report that the food was disappointing on both my recent visits. David's Restaurant's version of infusion cooking has too many flavors and rich ingredients.
On weeknights, dinner is served only in the upstairs room. On our first visit, we were seated there, surrounded by windows and bordered on one side by the bar. There are 10 tables covered in white linen and graced by small oil lights.
Our server was pleasant and accomplished. She attended to our needs without being intrusive.
To begin, I ordered the crispy packets of herbed goat cheese ($5.95). Two squares of flaky phyllo dough burst open when cut into, spilling their luscious contents -- pungent, warmed goat cheese with fragrant herbs. The packets were served on grilled vegetables -- zucchini, and red, green and yellow peppers. The whole affair was topped with a pile of frizzled leeks and was sitting in a pool of balsamic reduction. The flavor of the packets was so good that the reduction was a distraction.
My companion ordered the lobster, scallop and sweet potato cakes with red pepper, scallions and lobster sauce ($6). Egg white served as binder for the two cakes. They were lightly pan-fried, too lightly. They were undercooked and mushy inside, and very sweet because of the grated sweet potato. They were served with a robust red pepper and lobster sauce. A small salad of greens, onions and carrot was also on the plate.
Other appetizers include lobster stew ($7.95), grilled seafood sausage with white bean puree and anise cream sauce ($5.95), and bruschetta with basil tomato relish, mozzarella and parmesan cheeses ($3.75).
Breads are homemade. We sampled whole wheat sweet dinner rolls studded with raisins, and white bread. The latter was served with a good olive oil for dipping. Both breads were freshly baked and delicious.
Salads are a la carte. I chose the endive with ripened cluster tomatoes, avocado and blue cheese ($4.25). The presentation was beautiful; the endive spears and tomato wedges were arranged in the shape of a star. Avocado topped the center, and the blue cheese was in each endive spear and sprinkled all over. The dressing was laced heavily with black pepper. It overwhelmed the avocado. The ingredients were fresh, and the cheese was not overpowering.
My companion chose the baby arugula greens with marinated fresh mozzarella and roasted red peppers and onions ($4.75). This salad was lovely and had great flavor, though the mozzarella was a bit rubbery and didn't seem marinated. The dressing was balsamic.
For an entree, I ordered one of the evening's specials, Maine shrimp and scallops in a curry cream sauce ($16.95). It was served with jasmine and black sticky rice. I obviously missed something when the description of this dish was read to me. I was surprised to find a plate filled with fruit --- kiwi, star fruit, red and green grapes, two kinds of melon --- mixed in with the seafood. My companion was as surprised as I was by the combination set before me. The scallops were plentiful but overcooked. There were just too many things happening on this plate.
My companion ordered the sauteed breast of duck served with ginger and scallion sauce and cold sesame soba noodles. ($17.95). The duck - - nine slices -- was crispy on the outside, and the meat was fork- tender. It was served with a light gravy. The cold noodles were a perfect complement to the meat. They were tossed with sesame oil, peanut butter and had a spicy bite. They were garnished with scallions.
Other entrees include applewood grilled salmon with herbed garlic butter ($15.95), seared herb crusted tenderloin of beef with Madeira mushroom demi glaze ($18.95), and rack of lamb with herbs de Provence ($19.25).
Dessert choices are plentiful -- nine on the regular menu and two specials the evening of the first visit. From Maytag blue cheese with fruit and bread ($3.95), to raspberry or lemon sorbet ($3.25), the choices are sure to please everyone.
I selected the wild berry shortcake with whipped cream ($3.95). Two squares of shortbread type shortcake were covered with a mix of blueberries and raspberries. Dramatically presented in an oversized soup plate, the dessert was garnished with freshly whipped cream. I was disappointed in the shortcake, which tasted old.
My companion ordered the chocolate espresso torte with cappuccino creme anglais ($4.25). The torte was creamy and decadent, and iced with a dark chocolate layer. The creme anglais was light and subtly flavored. It was decorated with raspberry sauce in a beautiful marbleized pattern. This dessert was sumptuous.
On my second visit, I asked to be seated in the cozy downstairs. We sank into wing chairs and were alone for quite a while.
Our dinner was no better, though. While the baked oysters Rockefeller ($6.25) were good, the Caesar salad ($3.50) was soaked with rich dressing and covered with grated cheese.
Our entrees did not match the descriptions on the menu. The rack of lamb, medium ($19.25), was described as marinated in herbs de Provence with roasted garlic and rosemary sauce and saffron and roasted garlic aioli. Instead, I got extremely rare lamb slices on a mashed potato Tian -- a round of potatoes -- topped with balsamic vinegar-marinated tomatoes. This was surrounded by the garlic rosemary sauce. The potatoes contained roasted garlic, sour cream, and pecarrino romano and were heavy. The balsamic, garlic and rosemary were overwhelming. Mr. Turin told me that this dish was the one listed on the menu, but that it had not been fully described.
My companion ordered the shiitake mushroom ravioli with exotic mushrooms ($15). The menu said this was served in a Madeira mushroom sauce with wilted spinach. It failed to mention that it contained heavy cream and was covered with grated cheese. The raviolis were wonderful, but the sauce was so rich that it could not be enjoyed.
Our bill -- before tax, tip or drinks -- was $66 on the first visit and $59 the second.
David's infusion cooking -- a melding of international cuisine styles and influences -- is indeed different. Tighter descriptions of the dishes would eliminate surprises for diners and assure an enjoyable experience.

PRIVATE CLAM COMPANY GETS LEASE FOR LAKE BUT THE COMPANY OWNER SAYS HE'D LIKE TO WORK OUT A DEAL WITH LOCAL CLAMMERS.

Abstract: Now that Spinney Creek Shellfish has won the exclusive right to raise clams in a section of New Meadows Lake, the company says it is willing to share. Local diggers have been upset at Spinney Creek, worried that the state's approval of a lease would shut them out of the upper lake, which is the dammed end of the New Meadows River between West Bath and Brunswick. Marine Commissioner George Lapointe said he granted the lease because water has been moderately polluted and Spinney Creek, which has the equipment to flush out contaminants in clams, followed all the application rules.

Full text: Now that Spinney Creek Shellfish has won the exclusive right to raise clams in a section of New Meadows Lake, the company says it is willing to share.
"I'd like to work with the towns to come up with a better solution," said Tom Howell, the owner of the aquaculture company based in Eliot. "I'm a businessman in this state and having war doesn't help anybody."
Local diggers have been upset at Spinney Creek, worried that the state's approval of a lease would shut them out of the upper lake, which is the dammed end of the New Meadows River between West Bath and Brunswick.
People from those towns protested at a hearing in May, saying the saltwater lake with hard-shell quahog clams at the bottom was nearly clean and too valuable to be turned over to a private company.
Howell received word in the mail Tuesday that the state had approved a 10-year lease.
Marine Commissioner George Lapointe said he granted the lease because water has been moderately polluted and Spinney Creek, which has the equipment to flush out contaminants in clams, followed all the application rules.
"I had no good reason to say no," said Lapointe. "I didn't have the discretion of changing the laws in midstream."
Perhaps, he said, the state should consider altering the law, which demands that the commissioner base any decision on the past record, not the promise of change in the future, such as the clearing up of pollution.
"If a process raises this many questions, as this one has, I'd like to review the entire process to make sure we're doing it right," said Lapointe.
He said he expects the Legislature to take up the issue as a bill calling for change has been submitted by legislators representing Brunswick.
West Bath hopes to set up a meeting with Howell next week. Clam committee Secretary Jack Castner was both optimistic and skeptical about the offer to share.
"There's enough there to share. Sharing would be fine with me," said Castner.
But, he added, "OK, define 'share' for me," he said.
Spinney Creek also has asked for a three-year lease to a third of an acre in the lower lake to raise tiny baby clams. The lower lake has been open to licensed clammers since 1997, when the state declared it clean.
That lease request is pending. Representatives of Brunswick and West Bath have protested that, too, saying the lease would interfere with clammers who have been going there to rake. A hearing has been scheduled for April 6.
Clam digger Mark Nelson said he was disappointed with Lapointe's decision.
"I think the state did let us down," said Nelson, chairman of the West Bath Clam Committee, which works with 22 local diggers to manage the seashore. "I still think it should be open to the general public, not grant sole rights to private companies."
He said that Howell's interest in making peace was promising. "I'm still not happy at all," Nelson said. "But it might work out."
The Brunswick marine director said the town has 30 days to consider whether to appeal the decision in court.
"The commissioner has seen fit to lease over 60 acres for private gains for the next 10 years," said Alan Houston. "I think this is a real setback for public harvesting."

Full text: When Bill Mook lost all of his shellfish to a mysterious killer last year, he launched an investigation that led to a neighbor, a garden hose and now, a $1.2 million lawsuit.
Mook first noticed something was wrong when millions of clam larvae, translucent and tiny as a pinprick, failed to develop last winter. Some died immediately. Others grew distorted shells and perished. Still others failed to settle.
Mook Sea Farm Inc. has grown shellfish on the Damariscotta River since 1985. It is a business that annually produces 120 million oysters, clams and juvenile scallops, which Mook sells up and down the East Coast.
The heart of the million-dollar business is the hatchery, a series of tanks inside a Quonset hut at the end of a long, icy road. Just offshore, under 6 feet of water, is the pump that supplies the hatchery's life blood: pristine sea water from the Damariscotta River Estuary.
As the die-offs continued, Mook tried everything: He cleaned the tanks, pumped at different tides, moved the pump, shut down the hatchery and started over. Nothing worked. Batch after batch crashed, all summer long.
"I was at my wits' end," he said.
Finally, last fall, he got a tip that led him to conduct surveillance on the property of septic hauler Fred T. Bates, 300 feet upriver.
What Mook saw resulted in a $1,162,171 million lawsuit, based on lost operations, staff and sales. The suit against Bates, partner Alan J. MacPhee and their businesses was filed in Lincoln County Superior Court on Nov. 19.
Mook says his neighbors drained a 2,000-gallon tanker truck holding raw sewage and toxic chemicals onto the ground -- ruining his larval shellfish output for 1998.
"The evidence will show that Mook Sea Farm's entire 1998 hatch was destroyed. The evidence will also show the defendants' clear liability for the damages," attorney James Clifford said.
In affadavits, Bates and MacPhee deny any liability.
In an interview, Bates' lawyer, Kaign Smith, said the waste was discharged on Bates property, but that Bates didn't know it was wrong.
"He admits that, and he regrets it," Smith said. "But he never thought it was harmful to people or the environment; it is spread on fields every day."
The case, pushed along by Mook's persistence, prompted the state Department of Environmental Protection to investigate, and if wrongdoing is shown, the result could be fines of up to $10,000 a day per incident.
Right now, though, DEP is trying to negotiate a settlement. "If not, we'll take him to court," said DEP Enforcement Director James Dusche.
In his lawsuit, it is clear that Mook undertook his mission much like a spy. Here, according to the suit, is how he went about it:
Around midnight on Sept. 20, the day Mook got the tip, he put on dark clothing, taped his flashlight to a narrow beam, and picked his way over slippery rocks along the shore to a gully that led to Bates' house. Creeping to the top of the embankment, he says, he observed a large septic waste pumper trunk owned by Bates parked less than 100 feet from the river.
Two garden hoses were coiled behind the truck. Mook approached and found them caked with sewage.
Keeping the discovery to himself, he went back the next night, and the next.
On Sept. 24 and 25, he saw a smaller "Bates & MacPhee" tank truck, which services portable toilets, parked beside the larger truck. On the back were several gallon jugs containing a blue liquid that Mook believes was a solution for the toilets.
A former science teacher, Mook decided to perform some tests. He took a sample from one of the jugs to send to a lab in Westbrook for analysis. He decided to keep a log and document everything he witnessed.
"I knew it wasn't enough to prove (the) dumping. I had to connect the dumping with my problems at the hatchery," he said.
Mook continued to visit Bates' property every night, but nothing was happening. He was beginning to feel discouraged. Days later, he found what he was looking for.
One of the hoses was hooked up to the back of the large truck, according to the lawsuit. It stretched through the woods parallel to the gully, ending less than 100 feet from the water.
The content of the truck's tank was slowly flowing from the hose onto the ground. Mook filled three containers with the effluent, and took a photograph.
This time, he sent samples to two labs to be analyzed.
His nightly sojourns resumed. On Oct. 21, Mook took Lewiston private investigator Steve Gauvin with him. Gauvin, according to the lawsuit, also observed the hose hooked up to the larger truck. They collected more samples. Gauvin videotaped what they saw.
According to the lawsuit, lab tests on the blue solution showed acetone, toluene and other chemicals. The truck effluent also contained chemicals that included acetone, as well as human waste.
But soil tests conducted by the DEP showed only trace levels of 15 different chemicals.
"We didn't find any Porta-Potty chemicals in the soil," Dusche said.
Still, Mook says that when he exposed healthy larvae to the truck effluent, they stopped eating and swimming, developed abnormalities, and died in the same manner he'd been seeing all year.
Mook presented that evidence to DEP officials, and they decided to take a closer look. DEP inspector James C. Pollock visited Bates' property.
Looking around, Pollock found a garden hose connected to the outlet valve of the pumper truck. The hose was laid through the woods behind the vehicle.
At first, Bates denied wrongdoing, according to Pollock, but then said he had pumped septic waste from the holding tanks once or twice.
"Subsequently, Bates told me he had dumped probably eight to 10 loads," Pollock said.
Pollock on Nov. 20 filed a notice of violation against Bates, charging him with three violations of state law: dumping septic waste on his property, discharging to the surface waters of the state, and failing to report pumping and disposal activities.
For their soil and drainage tests, DEP scientists used a fluorescent yellow-green dye. The tests showed trace levels of chemicals, but none that state chemists associate with portable toilets, according to Dusche.
"However, those are biodegradable and could have evaporated or washed away in rain," he said.
Dusche speculates that the chemicals found in the truck effluent could have come from substances flushed down toilets. Acetone is a common solvent, and is used to take off nail polish, for example.
Just as Mook made every move he could to keep his business afloat, Bates' company closed down.
"As you can probably guess, he has been shunned by a large portion of this community. People refuse to deal with him," said Smith, his attorney.
MacPhee, like Bates, had his assets attached by the court, at Mook's request.
Superior Court Justice Jeffrey Hjelm later detached MacPhee's plumbing business, ruling that "nothing in the present record suggests that this defendant participated in any of the acts that form the basis of this suit." MacPhee remains personally liable as a partner in Bates & MacPhee.
Mook insists that when the dumping stopped, the problem went away.
Thirty days after Bates ceased operations, Mook says he succeeded in raising 1 million clam larvae at the Darling Marine Center, just downriver from the hatchery, using water from the estuary.
During the worst of it, Mook laid off five of his seven employees, and was afraid he might lose his own assets, including his house, used to guarantee a loan.
But something more important was at stake, it turns out. "I was on the verge of losing what my whole professional identity is all about," he said.
These days Mook is getting the hatchery ready for a new, hopefully successful, season. "My optimism is back," he said. "I have a lot to be thankful for in 1999."

Full text: Kathryn Lefebvre of Gorham knew deep down what would happen. But watching the U.S. Senate acquit President Clinton on Friday afternoon still boiled her blood.
"I saw that on TV today when I came home from grocery shopping, and I was just irate," said Lefebvre.
"I just don't see how we can let him get away with this."
Lots of Mainers do, but even they were angry Friday.
The acquittal of Clinton ended a year-long scandal and sparked one more round of street-corner and kitchen-table conversations between co-workers and family members who sometimes seem to be viewing the scandal from different planets.
Friday's anticlimax left a lot of people on all sides upset -- at Clinton, at Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, at Congress, even at society.
The worst part, many said, was all the time and the millions of dollars wasted on the investigation and trial.
"And all they could do is badger him until he denies a sexual relationship," said Don Lawson-Stopps. "I think it's just ridiculous. It should never have happened."
Lawson-Stopps is a second-year law student at the University of Southern Maine. He and classmates discussed the verdict Friday afternoon in professor Donald Zillman's Constitutional Law class.
Jill Boyington, another student, was angry, too. But not at the prosecutors. Starr did his job by building and presenting the strongest case he could. "As lawyers we're supposed to be advocates," she said.
Her frustration was more aimed at the erosion of values and morals and America's acceptance of Clinton's behavior.
"It's like now we're a Jerry Springer nation," she said. "It all shouldn't have happened. . . . It's sad that we accept that he is in the Oval Office doing these things that he shouldn't be doing. It's sad for the country."
Zillman and his students talked about the legal and constitutional issues and the political fallout that may come out of the process. "It's over except for the recriminations," Zillman said, "and we'll be hearing those for a long time."
They were easy to hear Friday.
"I see people constantly complaining about how the world's kind of going to hell, and they wonder why.
Lefebvre, who is 18, said she worries for her 1-year-old son about the lack of outrage over Clinton's lying.
"My point of view is, well he lied plain and simple. Do we really want him to be our president anymore," she said.
"I think that it's all a bunch of hogwash, and they put a lot of taxpayer dollars into this and to just acquit him anyway is just ridiculous," said Jean Marden, as she waited at a bus stop in Portland for her grandson. "Didn't we all know this was going to happen anyway?" That money could have sheltered homeless people and fed hungry children, she said.
"They made a big issue of the fact that he lied and then they acquitted him anyway. They never would have acquitted me if I lied to the grand jury. That's what we're telling the kids: If we're president or someone important we can get away with it."
And that comes from someone who still supports the president.
"I think he's a good president. He's a great president, as a matter of fact. I don't care about his personal life," Marden said. But, "there should be some kind of punishment (for lying). My thing is, like, separating them. Here is Mr. President and here is Bill Clinton, and the president is doing his job and Bill Clinton is a screw-up."
The real mistake, according to Joe Boucher of Portland, was forcing Clinton to answer questions that should never have been asked. Boucher, a 29-year-old stagehand, said it was a colossal waste of time and money.
"I look at the whole thing as this snow job. They have this guy and he has this one weakness and they know they can corner him on it," he said. "The moral of the story is that some lawyers got richer."
The verdict didn't seem to bring a lot of relief to frustrated citizens. Said Boucher, "It just leaves this bad taste in your mouth for the next year-and-a-half."

Abstract: The state Department of Marine Resources has announced an April public hearing to discuss leasing part of the lower New Meadows lake to a private company. A shellfish farming firm in Eliot has asked the state for permission to rent a third of an acre below Route 1 to raise clams in the lake bed and on screened floating devices in the water. Clam committees from West Bath and Brunswick have protested the request from Spinney Creek Shellfish. Local clammers say they have been raking hard-shell quahogs from the lake bottom and they do not want this public area taken away.

Hearing on lake leasing scheduled
The state Department of Marine Resources has announced an April public hearing to discuss leasing part of the lower New Meadows lake to a private company.
A shellfish farming firm in Eliot has asked the state for permission to rent a third of an acre below Route 1 to raise clams in the lake bed and on screened floating devices in the water.
Clam committees from West Bath and Brunswick have protested the request from Spinney Creek Shellfish. Local clammers say they have been raking hard-shell quahogs from the lake bottom and they do not want this public area taken away.
People will have a chance to make their arguments known to the state on April 6 at 7 p.m. at the West Bath Elementary School on New Meadows Road.
Marine Commissioner George Lapointe will not make a decision on the matter until after that meeting.
In the past months Lapointe has been reviewing previous requests from Spinney Creek and Andrew Johnson to rent the part of the lake above Route 1 -- about 60 acres.
Representatives from Bath and Brunswick protested that first lease proposal at a hearing last May.
HARPSWELL
Selectmen try to avoid tax increase
Selectmen are working on a town budget that seeks to avoid a tax increase, hire consultants to help with grants and planning, and borrow money to fix up Town Hall.
Total spending has not been set, but hiring part-time help has been discussed and two selectmen have the support of the budget committee for town hall spending.
An architect's $300,000 plan proposes moving the busiest offices - - code enforcement and assessor -- to the entrance and moving the selectmen's area upstairs to the space that will be left empty when the television studio moves into a building now under construction.
The town clerk and tax collector would stay where they are on the other side of the hallway, but partitions would be incorporated into the work space to allow some privacy -- for paying tax bills, for example.
The plan calls for an addition to put in a boiler heating system and an elevator so the building will meet federal laws on accessibility for the disabled.
The town codes enforcement officer has suggested the budget include a new job for someone to help write land-use regulations and make sure they match the comprehensive plan.
A public meeting to explain these proposals has been planned to begin after the 6:30 p.m. selectmen's meeting March 4, before the town March 6 town meeting.

Council incumbents face competition
City Councilors Philip "Jack" Dawson and Charles W. Harlow appear to have challengers in their bids for re-election on May 4.
Harlow, of 36 Broadway, has taken out papers to run again in council District 5, and so has Richard A. Dodge of 1281 Forest Ave. District 5 includes Riverton and North Deering.
Dawson, of 49 Autumn Lane, is gathering signatures in preparation to run for his at-large council seat. So far, his only challenger is Ethan Strimling of 24 Mellen St., the executive director of the Portland West Neighborhood Planning Council.
Portland residents may file nomination papers for City Council or School Committee from March 16 to March 31. Nominating papers are available now in the City Clerk's office. At-large candidates need at least 300 signatures, while those running for district seats need a minimum of 75 signatures.
So far, the candidates for School Committee District 5 include incumbent David P. Ripley of Harris Avenue, and Jill C. Duson of Pennell Avenue.
Edward J. Luebbert Jr. of 25 Demerest St. is the only candidate so far for an at-large School Committee seat.
Michelle Hedrich of 142 Main Ave. is the only one in the race so far for School Committee District 4, which includes East Deering and Back Cove. That seat is now occupied by James Banks.
SOUTH PORTLAND
Ferry Village project up for review again
The South Portland Housing Authority will go before the Planning Board on Tuesday night to ask for reapproval of an elderly-housing complex in Ferry Village that is already under construction. The board's meeting begins at 7 p.m. at City Hall.
Although the city approved the $10.6 million project last summer, construction and funding were delayed last fall by a lawsuit filed by neighbors who say they weren't properly informed of public meetings concerning the high-rise complex. Neighbors say the 123-unit building, which would be seven stories in front and eight in back, would be too tall for their residential neighborhood.
The housing authority, in an effort to render the lawsuit moot and get financing for the project, had the city hold new public hearings this fall and got reapproval for a zoning change that permitted the housing complex to be built.
Neighbors have said the rehearings are a charade. Their lawsuit is still pending.
The housing authority's attorney, Gary Vogel, said lenders want the housing authority to get the Planning Board to reapprove the site plan. He said no changes have been made in the plans, so he expects the Planning Board to reapprove the project.
The project is being built on land owned by Southern Maine Technical College. The foundation is largely complete and construction is expected to resume March 1. The first 70-75 units are expected to be ready by the spring of next year.
SCARBOROUGH
Two shellfish licenses available
For the first time in three years, the town's shellfish commission has two commercial fishing licenses available for Scarborough residents.
The sale is by lottery, and the cost is $200. The licenses became available when two clammers did not complete the mandatory 12 hours of conservation efforts needed for renewal.
The commission also changed the provision of licenses for senior citizens. Previous regulations limited harvesting to two pecks per tide. That amount has been increased to one bushel per tide.
CUMBERLAND
Town may make loan to fix Greely pool
The Town Council tonight will consider loaning as much as $325,000 to School Administrative District 51 to fund repairs to Greely High School's swimming pool.
Seventy-five of the roof's 208 support beams are rusted, and several have collapsed, causing the roof to sink by as much as five inches in some areas, according to an analysis by a local engineering firm.
The pool has been closed and drained since the start of the Christmas break, when the problem was discovered. It is expected to remain closed at least through late May.
The problem was probably caused by improperly installed insulation, which trapped moisture on top of the support beams. The pool was built in 1968.
The council meeting begins at 7 p.m. at Town Hall.

IMPASTABLE DREAM: COZYING UP TO A FINE ITALIAN MEAL

Abstract: The Impastable Dream decided to stay open Friday through Monday. The Sunday night I ate there, the place was bustling with locals. My companion ordered the baked artichoke hearts ($5.50). A large oval baker was piled high with canned, quartered artichoke hearts. They were cooked in a light cheese/cream sauce and were topped with sauteed mushrooms and bread crumbs. This appetizer could have fed several people. The flavor was mild; it was quite rich; and there was so much of it. I ordered the evening special, sauteed shrimp, plum tomatoes, capers, mushrooms and artichoke hearts in a white wine and balsamic vinegar sauce served over angel hair pasta ($14.95). The dish contained 10 large, fresh shrimp, nicely cooked, and an equal number of artichoke hearts. The sauce had a subtle flavor, and the capers added a great zing. I sprinkled on some Parmesan cheese and was happy with the result.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
Ogunquit is deserted this time of year. Long gone are the legions of tourists and pleasure seekers. Closed are the shops and bistros. But I recently discovered a restaurant that's braving the weather.
The Impastable Dream decided to stay open Friday through Monday. The Sunday night I ate there, the place was bustling with locals.
The restaurant, open since May 1998, occupies a charming old building on Shore Road. Set back from the street, it was originally a home. The building has been added on to and now houses a small bar area and three dining rooms, including an enclosed front porch.
The main room has the original fireplace, which was crackling the night I visited. A smaller room has a family-sized table and can be used for private dinner. Original beams, woodwork and hardwood floors give the place a cozy feel.
The decoration is country; stenciling and dried flower arrangements cover the walls. Tables are draped with flowered cloths and topped with glass. Small candles and wall sconces cast a warm glow. Classical music softly plays in the background.
The wait staff was informal. Two servers took care of the crowd in an offbeat way, making jokes and trading quips with customers. It added to the sense of winter survival camaraderie.
The menu is primarily pasta -- by itself or in combination with seafood and chicken.
There are five appetizer choices ($2.75 - $5.50), 12 entrees done up in 23 combinations ($7.95 - $14.95 and market), four house favorites in eight combinations ($10.95 - $14.95), and six items identified as traditional favorites ($7.95 - $9.95).
To begin, I ordered a cup of the soup of the day ($2.75). The combination of salmon, tomato, mushrooms, leeks and vegetable stock was a takeoff on classic seafood stew. The flavors had been allowed to mellow, and the cup was full of chunks of salmon.
My companion ordered the baked artichoke hearts ($5.50). A large oval baker was piled high with canned, quartered artichoke hearts. They were cooked in a light cheese/cream sauce and were topped with sauteed mushrooms and bread crumbs. This appetizer could have fed several people. The flavor was mild; it was quite rich; and there was so much of it.
Other appetizers include bruschetta, fried eggplant with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella on french bread with marinara sauce ($4.95); steamed mussels ($4.95); and mussels fra diavolo ($5.50).
A small loaf of freshly baked garlic bread was brought to our table. The bread, which was a pre-made loaf, was infused with garlic. The loaf had been sliced and buttered.
Salads are included with every entree. I was delighted by the bowl of fresh leaf lettuce that was set in front of me. Included in the mix was red onion, cherry tomatoes and grated carrot. Everything was fresh, colorful and crunchy.
The dressings were homemade, with the exception of the Italian. I selected the blue cheese vinaigrette. It had nice chunks of blue cheese in a flavorful oil-and-vinegar mix. My companion tried the pepper Parmesan, also a good balance of flavors.
As we watched plates of entrees being delivered from the kitchen, we remarked on the large portions. When ours were set in front of us, we were astounded by the size. The plates were oversized and heaped with food. These plates could have been served family-style -- each adequately feeding three to four people.
I ordered the evening special, sauteed shrimp, plum tomatoes, capers, mushrooms and artichoke hearts in a white wine and balsamic vinegar sauce served over angel hair pasta ($14.95). The dish contained 10 large, fresh shrimp, nicely cooked, and an equal number of artichoke hearts. The sauce had a subtle flavor, and the capers added a great zing. I sprinkled on some Parmesan cheese and was happy with the result.
My companion ordered the Italian pasta ($11.95), billed as the signature dish of the Impastable Dream. Sweet Italian sausage, pepperoni, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes and garlic were tossed with thin spaghetti. I found this dish to be a bit oily from the sausage and pepperoni, neither of which was homemade.
Other choices include fruitti di mare ($14.95), shrimp, scallops, mussels and fish in a tomato and shellfish broth; Greek pasta with onion, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, calamata olives, garlic and feta ($12.95/$13.95 with chicken/$14.95 with shrimp); cheese ravioli ($11.95 with marinara, $12.95 with mushroom marinara); baked eggplant, veal or chicken parmigiana ($9.95/14.95/$13.95); and spaghetti alla aglio ($7.95), pasta with garlic, olive oil and crushed red pepper.
There were five dessert selections, though our waiter -- the bartender pressed into service on a busy night -- forgot to tell us about the fifth choice -- the only homemade one, chocolate mousse.
I choose the Italian classic, tiramisu ($3.50). This version had been made in a rectangular pan and was cut in a square. The marscapone cheese filling and the mocha swirled throughout were very good. The sponge cake base was soaked with liquid -- obviously because it had been sitting for too long.
We experienced the same problem with the berry pie ($3.50). The crust was old and had taken on the flavor of other foods. The owner was aware of the problem.
The other choices were spumoni and snickers cheese cake ($3.50 each).
Our bill, before tax, tip or drinks, was $42.
Note: Impastable Dream is closed today.

Abstract: The work at BIW requires blasting the bottom of the Kennebec River, an area where the endangered shortnose sturgeon seem quite content to stay. They are floating -- during winter months, they rarely move -- off the shore of the Washington Street shipyard, and have put the BIW project behind by about two months. Scientists had expected the fish to swim upriver last November, but unseasonably warm weather and an unexplained attachment to the Bath section of river apparently convinced several hundred to remain behind. Studies had shown that shortnose sturgeon spend their winters in upper Merrymeeting Bay off Swan Island, between Richmond and Dresden. BIW, which hoped to begin blasting the river's bottom late last year, finally got permission to do the work this month from the National Marine Fisheries Service. The company started blasting and dredging the river Jan. 11 under an agreement with the federal agency, which is charged with protecting endangered species.

Full text: Several hundred stubborn sturgeon are staying in the waters off Bath Iron Works, delaying the shipyard's $218 million modernization.
The work at BIW requires blasting the bottom of the Kennebec River, an area where the endangered shortnose sturgeon seem quite content to stay. They are floating -- during winter months, they rarely move -- off the shore of the Washington Street shipyard, and have put the BIW project behind by about two months.
The result is a situation that has aggravated BIW officials and puzzled scientists.
Scientists had expected the fish to swim upriver last November, but unseasonably warm weather and an unexplained attachment to the Bath section of river apparently convinced several hundred to remain behind. Studies had shown that shortnose sturgeon spend their winters in upper Merrymeeting Bay off Swan Island, between Richmond and Dresden.
"Who knows why. These fish are just like individuals," said Lewis Flagg, a marine scientist with the Department of Marine Resources. "Some like to live near the North Pole, others near the equator."
BIW, which hoped to begin blasting the river's bottom late last year, finally got permission to do the work this month from the National Marine Fisheries Service. The company started blasting and dredging the river Jan. 11 under an agreement with the federal agency, which is charged with protecting endangered species.
BIW must blast the river's bottom to make space for construction of a dry dock landing grid system. The work, which includes extensive dredging, must be completed by the end of March, when thousands of shortnose sturgeon return to the lower Kennebec to spawn and feed.
"We've told BIW to do everything possible to get the work finished by the end of March. They are optimistic they can meet that deadline," said Jon Kurland, assistant habitat coordinator at the fisheries service.
BIW is required to report any shortnose sturgeon that might be killed by the blasting -- so far, none has been reported -- and to monitor daily the movements of two particular shortnose sturgeon with sonic transmitters sewn into their flesh.
The tagged sturgeon are two of the 17 shortnose sturgeon and three Atlantic sturgeon caught last April to allow scientists to track their movements. Each transmitter runs off a battery and emits a unique sonic pulse that lets scientists know which fish they are monitoring. The sturgeon can be tracked from boats, or from a system of stationary receivers attached to buoys in the river. Scientists know that sturgeon Nos. 12 and 16 are near BIW because of the distinctive pulses coming from their transmitters.
The federal government is so concerned that the blasting might harm the fish that BIW and its consultant, Normandeau Associates of Yarmouth, must file weekly "detection reports." Those reports record, in stern detail, the arrival and departure times of sturgeons 12 and 16 through BIW.
"Both tagged fish were greater than 500 feet from the blast site. The tagged fish did not change position after the blast. The area between the outfitting pier and the south yard was intensively surveyed for any mortalities and none were found," Scott Farrell of Normandeau Associates wrote in his Jan. 11 report.
An estimated 7,000 to 10,000 shortnose sturgeon inhabit the Kennebec and Androscoggin river systems. Flagg estimates that about 10 percent of the Kennebec's total sturgeon population are hanging out with Nos. 12 and 16.
Sturgeon 12 has acquired a troublemaker's reputation. That fish is currently floating in an area of the river adjacent to the construction site. Sturgeon 16 has been staying downstream, near the Maine Maritime Museum. BIW must delay blasting whenever either of the study fish swims within 250 feet of the blast site.
"There is still one fish (No. 12) that we are keeping an eye on," BIW spokeswoman Sue Pierter said.
Illustration PHOTO: b&w GRAPHIC: Shortnose sturgeon; Caption: Staff art Shortnose sturgeon The shortnose sturgeon is a member of a group of fish that retains many characterships of the geologic past. One variety, the white sturgeon, is the largest fish alive today. The shortnose sturgeon rarely exceeds 3 feet and generally weighs 5 to 6 pounds. It matures at about 14. Females can live up to 70 years. It ranges is mostly in river mouths, tidal waters, estuaries and bays in New Brunswick to Florida. There are 7,000 to 10,000 adults in the Kennebec-Androscoggin river system. That's the largest population in the New England and one of largest on the Eastern Seaboard. Shortnose sturgeon are bottom feeders, using whisker-like barbels to find worms and mollusks.

Abstract: Mark Nelson gazed at the frozen expanse of New Meadows Lake and thought of losing "everything" -- the right to dig clams where they are most bountiful. Here, the lake is almost clean enough for public clamming because of town efforts to replace the last of the old lakeside septic systems. With hard-shell clam prices as high as $55 a bushel, a person could make $200 a day at the lake by standing in a boat and scooping from the bottom with a long-handled rake. West Bath, Brunswick and Phippsburg have begun reviewing pages of lease instructions from the state. Nelson has begun to collaborate with these neighbors to reserve a cove and what remains of the lake - - areas where residents have been working with the state to clean up pollution.

Full text: Mark Nelson gazed at the frozen expanse of New Meadows Lake and thought of losing "everything" -- the right to dig clams where they are most bountiful.
This has been Nelson's lament ever since he learned that an aquaculture company, already seeking rights to one part of the lake, was going back to the state for more.
"I feel we've lost the battle here," he said of the upper lake, a dammed ocean inlet along the border of Brunswick and West Bath.
Here, the lake is almost clean enough for public clamming because of town efforts to replace the last of the old lakeside septic systems. With hard-shell clam prices as high as $55 a bushel, a person could make $200 a day at the lake by standing in a boat and scooping from the bottom with a long-handled rake.
To defend clamming grounds for locals, Nelson -- chairman of the town clam committee -- is trying to stop the state from renting more prime, deep-water shellfish grounds to private companies by organizing the first-ever local government bids for those areas.
West Bath, Brunswick and Phippsburg have begun reviewing pages of lease instructions from the state. Nelson has begun to collaborate with these neighbors to reserve a cove and what remains of the lake - - areas where residents have been working with the state to clean up pollution.
"I thought the state's job was to work for us and it appears to me that they're not," Nelson said.
Together, towns involved in the effort have more than 100 professional diggers who raise families with the money they make from digging the shores.
"The state has been terribly irresponsible leasing them to private companies," said Bob Cummings, a clam committee member in Phippsburg, where several thousand acres of once-polluted mud are now clean enough to dig. "We've spent thousands of dollars cleaning up. There's no logical reason to go into the complicated lease arrangement."
Though the private New Meadows leases remain undecided, Cummings, like Nelson, fears the worst. The newest request, announced last month, is for an already-open part of the lake below Route 1. The company chose a rich spot, Nelson said -- a third of an acre that is one of his favorites.
He has been aggravated by Spinney Creek Shellfish, a private fish- farming company that is more than an hour away in Eliot, near the New Hampshire border.
He had always thought diggers, who spend hours tending the mud by planting tiny "seed" clams, had a right to the shore. While state law does allow leasing, towns with public aquaculture programs hadn't felt threatened until Spinney Creek began applying.
"It kind of breaks the backbone of Maine history," Nelson said. "And the state wants to give it away for a small fee to just anybody."
The state Department of Marine Resources has no choice. A decades- old law allows leases where the waters are subtidal and don't drop to mud when the tide pulls out, said Penn Estabrook, the deputy commissioner.
But, before deciding, the state must consider whether the area to be leased is already being used for fishing. That, he said, would be a factor at the lower lake, where people have been raking since it was declared pollution-free in 1997.
Control of tidal zones where towns have shellfish programs is shared by local governments and the state. Towns have the power to deny those requests.
While Marine Commissioner George Lapointe has yet to make a final decision on the upper lake, staff has recommended renting most of it for 10 years -- about 60 acres at $3,000 a year -- to the owners of Spinney Creek and Andrew Johnson, who works with the company.
Representatives of Brunswick and Bath, who objected to that project at a hearing last May, say they will protest the new lease as well.
Lori Howell, vice president of Spinney Creek, said the company plans to harvest clams and apply young clams and oysters in the upper lake. In the lower lake, the company would raise seed by the millions on screened floating devices.
It could sell the seed and use the lake bottom to test which clam size grows best when planted.
"This should be looked at as part of the overall building of the clam infrastructure," said Howell, who is president of the Maine Aquaculture Association and a member of a state aquaculture regulation review board. "It will help the entire industry, top to bottom."
Brunswick's marine director, Alan Houston, says he doesn't object to Howell's new proposal to raise seed, but his town will oppose it because she also asked for exclusive rights to use the lake bottom, a move that would keep local clammers out.
The Brunswick clam committee also has submitted a bill in Augusta, through local legislators, to give towns power to say no to subtidal leases.
As for towns filling out applications to lease the lower lake, Houston called that a waste of time and money. "It's a shame that municipalities have to do this," he said.
"I thought the state's job was to work for us and it appears to me that they'e not." Mark Nelson, West Bath clammer

Abstract: As she has done nearly every year since immigrating to Maine in 1989, Elizabeth's grandmother returned to our hometown of Malabon; this year, she celebrated Christmas and New Year's there. Malabon used to be a small fishing village on the outskirts of Manila, a home port for fishing vessels big and small to drop their catch for the wholesale market. In my lifetime, Malabon has lost much of its distinct character as it merged into the nondescript urban sprawl of the capital. I remember that, as a child, returning to Malabon from rare shopping trips in Manila was always a uniquely sensual experience. Even with my eyes closed, I knew I was getting close to Malabon when I could smell the pungent aroma of fish in the air.

Full text:   Grace Valenzuela is secretary-treasurer of the Portland Bias Crime Task Force. She is also a board member of ALANA (African, Latino/a, Asian and Native American) and the National Coalition Building Institute.
Almost every day, Elizabeth would ask, "How many more days before grandma gets home?" after my mother left for a six-week vacation in the Philippines.
As she has done nearly every year since immigrating to Maine in 1989, Elizabeth's grandmother returned to our hometown of Malabon; this year, she celebrated Christmas and New Year's there.
Malabon used to be a small fishing village on the outskirts of Manila, a home port for fishing vessels big and small to drop their catch for the wholesale market. In my lifetime, Malabon has lost much of its distinct character as it merged into the nondescript urban sprawl of the capital.
Yet it remains a fishing town, famous as the source of the best fish sauce in the country, and noted especially for its pancit Malabon, a specialty noodle dish flavored with oysters, shrimp, and smoked fish.
I remember that, as a child, returning to Malabon from rare shopping trips in Manila was always a uniquely sensual experience. Even with my eyes closed, I knew I was getting close to Malabon when I could smell the pungent aroma of fish in the air.
My hair would be stirred by gusty sea breezes, much stronger than those in Manila, because in Malabon there were many fewer buildings to block the wind blowing off the bay. And when I opened my eyes, there before me would be acres upon acres of freshwater fish ponds, entrancing in their rectangular regularity.
Sadly for me, these images and sensations are now only memories. The fish ponds have been filled in to make housing developments.
The town teems with new people "from away," so relationships tend to be less familiar and close-knit than they used to be. And alongside the fresh food market are franchises like Dunkin' Donuts. Despite all these glaring changes, however, Malabon is still "home" for my mother, just as it has always been.
Portland, Maine, my mother's adopted home, has some similarities to Malabon: its size, its stature as a busy fishing port, its mix of rich and poor people and its many families whose local ties go back for generations. There are significant differences, too: the architecture, the pace of life, the economy, and, perhaps most strikingly of all, the weather.
But while it may be raining icicles outside, everything inside my mother's house is as tropical as can be, and the rooms in her house are adorned with the warmth and comfort of things familiar.
The smells from my mother's kitchen -- garlic, ginger, fish sauce -- are the same as those in any kitchen in Malabon. There is always fresh cooked food on the kitchen table, and the rice cooker by the window is always on, offering warm rice to the hungry. Her pantry is lined with dry noodles, teas, and spices of all kinds.
The living room is graced with antique, caned mahogany chairs which have been in the family forever. Stacked on the bookshelves are videotapes of Filipino movies and television shows and cassettes and CDs of Filipino artists. For Elizabeth's afternoon naps, my mother would play a cassette of kundiman, a form of Filipino love songs, some of which Elizabeth learned to sing when she was 3.
On the makeshift altar in her bedroom are imahen and santos, religious icons revered for their miraculous powers. She has several images of the Virgin Mary, patron saint of barangay Concepcion in Malabon. There is also a replica of the Black Nazarene, and of the Santo Nino.
In many ways, my mother's home mirrors the homes of other newcomers to Portland, whether from Central Africa, Eastern Europe or South America. Each of these homes has a distinct character created by artifacts such as tapestries, handicrafts, sculptures, pottery, china, prayer rugs, textiles, and cooking gadgets.
Character is also expressed in the aromas of a home -- cooking spices, bathing herbs, burning incense -- and in the sounds that a home makes, languages spoken, music played, prayer chants recited.
No matter how distant one's native country may be, there is some comfort in creating a surrounding with fragments of one's identity and remembrances of a life left behind. While the environment outside my mother's home could be so overwhelmingly different, her home offers her only comfort and familiarity.
But still, no matter how much my mother recreates the home she left behind, there will always be something missing for her.
For Elizabeth, however, what makes my mother's home special is her grandmother and all the culture and history she brings with her.

Abstract: Inside, it's cozy. There are four booths built of pine, each with a stained-glass insert of a pine tree with a star overhead. Matching stained-glass lamps hang above each table. One larger table occupies a front window. Colorful pillows decorate and soften the benches. Several smaller tables dot the room. Artwork, ceramic plates and collections of old tins and odd pieces of art provide lots to look at. Upstairs is a deck for warm-weather dining and a private room for small gatherings. To begin, I ordered the soup du jour ($2.75 cup/$4.50 bowl) -- cream of mushroom. This thick, rich rendition was filled with meaty slices of porcini, shiitake, and Portobelo mushrooms, butter, cream, paprika, sherry and a sprinkling of nutmeg. This was a meal in a bowl -- satisfying, hearty, filled with flavor and texture. It is one of the best soups I've ever eaten. Salads are a la carte. We shared the mache and butter lettuce with porcini oil and walnuts ($7.95). From the first forkful, it was hard to believe it was winter in Maine. The produce was outstanding; the color was beautiful, and the flavor fresh and vibrant. The dressing was the correct amount. The porcini oil offered a woodsy flavor, the walnuts a nutty crunch. It was sprinkled with Asiago cheese and was fabulous.

After 15 years in a storefront in the heart of downtown Waldoboro, the Pine Cone Cafe is part of the fabric of the town.
The restaurant is certifiably quaint -- complete with ancient hardwood floors, a wood burning stove and several resident pets. Two large windows face Friendship Street. Black boards outside announce specials and beckon patrons.
Inside, it's cozy. There are four booths built of pine, each with a stained-glass insert of a pine tree with a star overhead. Matching stained-glass lamps hang above each table. One larger table occupies a front window. Colorful pillows decorate and soften the benches. Several smaller tables dot the room. Artwork, ceramic plates and collections of old tins and odd pieces of art provide lots to look at. Upstairs is a deck for warm-weather dining and a private room for small gatherings.
The night I visited, parties of two kept coming in. It was apparent they had been there before. All had delighted looks on their faces, and after our appetizer we understood why.
The food was fresh, interesting, and beautifully prepared and presented. The menu changes seasonally with additions made weekly.
Appetizers were simple -- jumbo Pemaquid oysters on the half shell ($9.95 for six) and a choice of three soups ($2.75 - $5.50). There were four salads ($2.95 - $7.95) and 11 entrees ($6.95 - $17.95). A good wine and beer selection is offered, including wines by the glass. I tried the Jack cider, a biting, slightly sweet, hard cider.
Even before we ordered, our waitress brought a basket of fragrant bread. It was studded with red pepper and had a chewy crust.
To begin, I ordered the soup du jour ($2.75 cup/$4.50 bowl) -- cream of mushroom. This thick, rich rendition was filled with meaty slices of porcini, shiitake, and Portobelo mushrooms, butter, cream, paprika, sherry and a sprinkling of nutmeg. This was a meal in a bowl -- satisfying, hearty, filled with flavor and texture. It is one of the best soups I've ever eaten.
My companion ordered the chowder of the day -- haddock ($2.95 cup/$5.50 bowl). The cup was heaped with fish and potatoes. They were swimming in a heavenly mix of butter, half and half, shallots, black pepper and fresh chives. It was superb. The other soup choice was a crock of French onion ($4.95).
Salads are a la carte. We shared the mache and butter lettuce with porcini oil and walnuts ($7.95). From the first forkful, it was hard to believe it was winter in Maine. The produce was outstanding; the color was beautiful, and the flavor fresh and vibrant. The dressing was the correct amount. The porcini oil offered a woodsy flavor, the walnuts a nutty crunch. It was sprinkled with Asiago cheese and was fabulous.
Other salads include wild greens ($2.95/$5.95), Caesar ($6.95, $7.95 to share), and large dinner salad with white truffle oil ($7.95).
For an entree, I chose the local crab cakes ($14.95). Three cakes were formed from fresh crab, bread crumbs, scallions, parsley, and seasonings, and were bound together with whole egg. It was topped with a rich remoulade of mayonnaise, capers and cornichons. All of this was presented on a bed of greens.
Also on the plate was a medley of winter vegetables -- carrots, kale, Savoy cabbage and yellow squash sauteed in olive oil and seasonings. Rounding out the plate was a simple combination of brown, white, red, and wild rice cooked in a vegetable stock with saffron and tumeric.
My companion ordered the Cornish game hen ($15.95). The presentation was beautiful. The hen was a rich brown and was resting in a pool of sweet, pungent, Grand Marnier glaze. Two rosettes of mashed potatoes were piped out on the plate. These were no ordinary spuds. They were laced with heavy cream, truffle oil, garlic and Parmesan cheese. There was also a pan-turned turnip and the winter vegetable medley.
Both of these entrees were outstanding meals. Other selections are: pan-sauteed breast of ducking with blackberries, pan sauce, and turned root vegetables ($17.95), New England oyster pie ($14.95), local sea scallop gratinee ($15.95), and flank steak with seared exotic mushrooms ($16.95).
There were six desserts. I ordered the lemon tart ($4.50). It was my only disappointment of the evening. Instead of a pastry shell filled with a tart filling, this dessert was served in a square. It was dense, like shortbread, and dried out. It broke into pieces when I stuck my fork into it. It was served with whipped cream.
My companion ordered the pear frangipani tart ($4.50). Wonderfully light pasty held the frangipani -- almond flavored pastry creme -- and pears. It was simply delicious.
Other desserts include chocolate mousse layer cake, fresh berry pie and maple pumpkin cake ($4.50 each).
Our bill, before tax, tip or drinks was $56.
One note: The restaurant will be closed from Feb. 8 until mid- April. The owner, Laura Cabot, will be attending Greyston, the Culinary Institute of America's West Coast branch. Imagine the new taste sensations when she re-opens.

FREEPORT RECONSIDERS CATERPILLAR SPRAYING SOME SAY THE CATERPILLARS MUST BE STOPPED, BUT OTHERS OPPOSE AERIAL SPRAYING OF PESTICIDE.

Abstract: People here are trying to figure out which toxin is worse: the hairs of the browntail moth caterpillar or the pesticide the state uses to kill the insect. The town was gearing up to launch its first aerial spraying of the caterpillars this spring until several people showed up at a hearing Tuesday and said they don't want an airplane dumping pesticide on their homes. "I've seen the victims of these moths -- children with horrible rashes who can't go outside in the summer," said David Soley, chairman of the Town Council. "The sentiment of the Town Council is, that's not acceptable. These moths are not native to Freeport. They don't belong in Freeport."

Full text: People here are trying to figure out which toxin is worse: the hairs of the browntail moth caterpillar or the pesticide the state uses to kill the insect.
The town was gearing up to launch its first aerial spraying of the caterpillars this spring until several people showed up at a hearing Tuesday and said they don't want an airplane dumping pesticide on their homes.
Now town officials will ask everyone in the proposed spraying area whether they support the project, then decide in March what to do.
The town's problem is the result of the northerly migration of the browntail moth, which infested Portland's islands in the early 1990s and has slowly moved up the coast.
The state, which has sprayed in other towns for several years, recommends that Freeport spray 800 to 1,000 acres, mostly along the coast and on islands.
About a dozen people have sent letters to the town requesting the spraying. The council has approved spending as much as $30,000 on the project.
"I've seen the victims of these moths -- children with horrible rashes who can't go outside in the summer," said David Soley, chairman of the Town Council. "The sentiment of the Town Council is, that's not acceptable. These moths are not native to Freeport. They don't belong in Freeport."
But if the town finds that many people in the areas to be sprayed oppose spraying, it will either avoid those areas or cancel the project.
"I'm concerned about it," said Joan Benoit Samuelson, who lives in the proposed spraying area on Lower Flying Point Road. "I feel we all need to know more about this pesticide. It affects everybody if you drop it from a plane."
"I don't think you should expose everybody to the pesticide to solve a problem that affects a minority of the population," said Dr. Alan Weiner, a Freeport resident who specializes in environmental medicine.
To kill the caterpillars, the state this year will likely use a pesticide called Confirm. The pesticide kills the insects by blocking the growth of their hard shells.
In past years, the state has used a pesticide called Dimilin, which has generated controversy because it can damage the shells of lobsters and other shellfish.
Richard Bradbury, the state entomologist, said Confirm is better because it will not have the same impact as Dimilin. He said the risk of either pesticide causing health problems in humans is low. But he said no pesticide is totally safe.
"I think the pesticides pose a very low risk compared to the toxin of the browntail moths," Bradbury said. "But people must decide what they would rather put up with."
Bradbury has recommended spraying parts of Harpswell, Brunswick, Freeport, Yarmouth and Cumberland to eliminate the pests.
The insects are a nuisance because when they shed their skin -- which they do five times before becoming moths -- their hairs become airborne. If the hairs come into contact with skin they can cause a severe rash. If inhaled, the hairs can cause respiratory problems.
Yarmouth conducted its first aerial spraying last year and plans to spray again this year.
Nat Tupper, the town manager, said three people, all lobstermen, opted out of the program last year. He said the properties were marked with helium balloons and the plane sprayed around them.
Tupper said people were relieved to get rid of the insects.
"Last summer (after the spraying), almost nobody complained to me, whereas the summer before I hardly ran into anybody who didn't complain about the moths," Tupper said. "Based on that reaction, I would say most people felt very strongly in favor of the program."

Full text: What's killing Maine lobsters is no longer a mystery, but still very puzzling, scientist say.
Researchers say a bacteria distantly related to the one that causes cholera caused lobsters to die in traps and at lobster pounds last year.
Working with University of Maine researchers, a microbiologist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Washington says he has identified the culprit that caused thousands of lobsters to perish as Vibrio fluvialis, a far less dangerous cousin to Vibrio cholera.
Ben Tall performed tests on lobster samples sent by Bob Bayer of the Lobster Institute at UM, which has tracked the problem since it began afflicting lobsters in Maine and New Brunswick more than a year ago.
Cholera, a disease spread by eating raw seafood, causes severe intestinal problems and can lead to death. Fluvialis, on the other hand, is less of a public health concern, said Tall.
People have become ill with diarrhea from the bacteria after eating raw or undercooked fish, but this is the first time the bacteria has been found in lobster, he said.
A third variety, Vibrio vulnificus, is found in mollusks such as oysters and mussels, and has been known to kill people who eat them raw. All three bacteria prey on those with already weakened immune systems.
Because lobsters are eaten only after they've been cooked, the bacteria should not spread to humans, Tall said. Scientists have found that the bacteria cannot survive temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius, about 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
There have been no reports of people being sickened after eating lobsters, Tall said. Nor have there been reports of lobstermen becoming sick after handling diseased lobsters.
Because fishermen reported finding dead lobsters in their traps, Tall said it appears the bacteria grows in the wild and may be spread by lobsters eating one another.
Researchers are still puzzled by why the crustaceans are not able to battle the bug, which naturally occurs in sea water.
Lobsters should be able to handle this type of bacterial invasion, said Maya Crosby, a member of the UM Lobster Health Monitoring and Research Team. "We still don't know what's weakening them in the first place," she said. Scientists have yet to rule out that a virus is attacking the lobsters' immune system. Lobster bait, fish scraps which come from as far away as Iceland, could also be a culprit.

'72 HURRICANE, NOT POLLUTION, MAY EXPLAIN RED-TIDE PROBLEM New England researchers are learning what causes outbreaks of the poisonous plankton.

Abstract: Pollution may not be the culprit that causes red tide, the sudden appearance of poisonous plankton that can make clams, mussels and other shellfish in New England too dangerous to eat, scientists report. New studies of where the red-tide organisms are found, and how they get transported into shellfish beds by winds and currents, indicate the organisms, called dinoflagellates, are always present far from shore in the Gulf of Maine. Occasionally they are driven toward shore when conditions are right. Red-tide events have been more common in New England since 1972 and have spread from waters in northeast Maine and Canada down the coast as far as Cape Cod. Experts suspected the cause might be increasing pollution. But now it's likely that a 1972 hurricane hit the Gulf of Maine so hard that it spread the poisonous organisms into new areas.

Full text: Pollution may not be the culprit that causes red tide, the sudden appearance of poisonous plankton that can make clams, mussels and other shellfish in New England too dangerous to eat, scientists report.
New studies of where the red-tide organisms are found, and how they get transported into shellfish beds by winds and currents, indicate the organisms, called dinoflagellates, are always present far from shore in the Gulf of Maine. Occasionally they are driven toward shore when conditions are right.
Red-tide events have been more common in New England since 1972 and have spread from waters in northeast Maine and Canada down the coast as far as Cape Cod. Experts suspected the cause might be increasing pollution. But now it's likely that a 1972 hurricane hit the Gulf of Maine so hard that it spread the poisonous organisms into new areas.
Although runoff from coastal cities, farms and factories was a prime suspect, the new findings by researchers from nine institutions, announced last month, tend to exonerate humans. These results come from the first large-scale, in-depth effort to study the distribution of Alexandrium tamarensis, the organism that causes the phenomenon, said Donald Anderson, a marine biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.
A. tamarensis is dangerous because it makes a neurotoxin that can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, muscle weakness, paralysis and even respiratory failure, sometimes leading to death in people who eat contaminated shellfish. The neurotoxin acts by interfering with the nervous system, hampering muscular movements.
The organisms occur in the sea as dormant, seedlike cysts that become active, swimming dinoflagellates when conditions are correct, Anderson said. When they wash into shellfish beds, the clams, scallops, oysters and mussels concentrate the organisms in their filter systems and become poisonous.
A. tamarensis is sometimes so abundant in New England that the water turns red, thus the name red tide. The organisms are sometimes found along Connecticut and Long Island shores, but the numbers are so small that, to this point anyway, they are not considered to be dangerous.
Now scientists are for the first time "making some excellent progress toward understanding the details" of what leads to such episodes, Anderson said. To reach that goal, research teams have been studying red tides that occur at different times in two major areas of the Gulf of Maine, Anderson said.
One group of researchers "is focusing on the region from Penobscot Bay all the way up into Canada," Anderson said. "That's where we know virtually nothing about the way red tides occur.
"The second part of this big project," he said, "starts at Penobscot Bay and works south. That's where we know a great deal more about the patterns of toxicity, and the way the organisms grow. Here, we can focus on more detailed scientific questions, looking especially at how these blooms begin."
Previous research suggested that the toxicity that occurs from Penobscot Bay southward "begins right there, at that spot," Anderson said. The organisms then traveled on the coastal currents that originate in rivers, such as the Kennebec and Androscoggin.
The exact source was thought to be a shallow water area, such as Casco Bay, where the dormant cysts would get more sunlight, warm up more quickly and become active in the shallow water.
But the new research suggests "that doesn't appear to be what's happening," Anderson said.
By monitoring toxic organisms found in mussels hung from moorings tens of miles out to sea, Anderson said, "we found that the earliest toxicity occurs in our most offshore sites, and then progressed inshore. It appears that these deep-water cysts are important."
And this surprise, he said, came from the findings to the north by researchers led by oceanographer David Townsend at the University of Maine.
Teams studying the northern end of the range found that a new pattern emerged as they plotted where the plankton occurred geographically, combined with temperature and nutrient measurements, and then superimposed this data on satellite maps.
The hypothesis that arose from this emerging pattern was "that the red tide is naturally occurring, and it's very abundant offshore," Townsend said.
Although researchers said they aren't fully sure why the red tide comes ashore in distinct episodes, they now strongly suspect "it's the currents, driven by winds," Townsend said.
Because pollution was a suspect cause of red tides, research had been focusing on water chemistry, pollution sources and the growth of Maine's coastal cities. Such factors seemed to speak to the known history of red-tide episodes, which were once isolated in Canadian waters but have expanded down the coast since 1972.
What's become clear, Anderson said, is that something big and important happened in 1972, and it seems to explain the spread of red tide. "There was a big hurricane, late in the season," just when the normal red tide was occurring in the Bay of Fundy.
"Strong winds circulating in this counterclockwise direction drove this population (of red-tide cysts) toward the south, and it took root down there," he said. Ever since, the red-tide organisms have stayed in the area, and now it seems they hide in the deep sea before being driven ashore into shellfish beds.
The big new research effort is important because previous research into red tide was done "by individuals, on tiny projects on tiny ships," Anderson said. Now, major resources are being supplied by four major federal agencies: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Ad- ministration.
Until now, Townsend explained, the general belief was that the frequency of red-tide episodes was "getting worse because of pollution. . . . But we were quite surprised to see so many cells out there in unpolluted water, 75 miles offshore."
The next step, Townsend added, is to "confirm our findings and hypotheses. We need to get together with our colleagues and see whether these cells are toxic when they're far out at sea; do they really represent the toxic populations?"
Illustration PHOTO: b&w; Caption: File photo A sign posted in the Little Neck area of Ipswich, Mass., this summer announces the closing of shellfish beds in offshore waters. Researchers in New England trying to determine the cause of red-tide outbreaks have recently learned that pollution - once thought to be the culprit - is not to blame. Instead, currents, driven by wind, are suspected to be causing the organisms to come ashore.

Abstract: The menu is small but diverse. There are five salads ($5 to $8), several soups and chowders ($3 and $5 cup/$5 and $7 a bowl), nine Bistro plates ($6 to $10) - each big enough for a small dinner or to share as an appetizer - and nine dinner entrees ($9 to $14, market for the seafood selection). There are also several specials each day. A choice wine list and good selection of beer are available. To begin, I ordered a cup of the potato Gorgonzola soup ($3). This rich soup had chunks of potatoes still in their skins, a light cream base, leeks, black pepper and garlic. It was wonderful; the Gorgonzola did not overpower the cream or potatoes. My companion ordered the Maine crab cakes sautAed in pumpkin butter with roasted garlic sauce ($10). Two extra-large cakes arrived on a bed of mesclun greens. They were filled with crab, scallion, lemon zest, cilantro, red pepper and parsley, and were held together with egg white. The texture was light and fluffy and the flavor outstanding. Alongside was an endive spear filled with a roasted garlic sauce. The greens were dressed with an outstanding raspberry vinaigrette. These were one of the best crab cakes I've tasted in Maine. Salads are a la carte. We ordered a spinach with Gorgonzola and a warm bacon dressing ($6). A huge plate arrived loaded with spinach, pancetta, pecans, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, garlic and lots of mild Gorgonzola. The combination was excellent, but there was too much dressing. The spinach leaves were sitting in a pool of it. It detracted from the fresh ingredients, but the flavor was very good. Other salads were fresh greens with balsamic vinaigrette ($5), grilled vegetables with fresh greens, feta, olives and vinaigrette ($7), and Caesar with croutons and white anchovies ($5) or chicken ($7).

Port Bakehouse has been turning out great bread and other baked goods for 22 years. Now, it's added a cafe at the shop on Commercial Street, and it is a delightful addition to the dining scene in Portland.
The building's attractive addition, with large windows that bow out, offers a view of the street and the wharf beyond. A bright color scheme, visible kitchen and bakery cases loaded with goodies make the interior warm and welcoming. There are five tables for two, four tables for four and a cozy booth under the staircase. A small counter area has chairs for four more. In summer, an upstairs deck seats many more.
The atmosphere is casual, and it's not terribly intimate. But don't let that deter you. The food is first-rate. And the wait staff are all friendly, helpful and just plain nice.
The menu is small but diverse. There are five salads ($5 to $8), several soups and chowders ($3 and $5 cup/$5 and $7 a bowl), nine Bistro plates ($6 to $10) - each big enough for a small dinner or to share as an appetizer - and nine dinner entrees ($9 to $14, market for the seafood selection).

Other appetizers included spicy pumpkin-and-rice soup, wild mushroom and chevre tart ($6), spinach quiche with feta and red pepper ($6) and smoked ham quiche with caramelized onions and cheddar ($7).
Along with the appetizers we were served a selection of excellent Port Bakehouse breads including whole grain, whole wheat and white.
Salads are a la carte. We ordered a spinach with Gorgonzola and a warm bacon dressing ($6). A huge plate arrived loaded with spinach, pancetta, pecans, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, garlic and lots of mild Gorgonzola. The combination was excellent, but there was too much dressing. The spinach leaves were sitting in a pool of it. It detracted from the fresh ingredients, but the flavor was very good. Other salads were fresh greens with balsamic vinaigrette ($5), grilled vegetables with fresh greens, feta, olives and vinaigrette ($7), and Caesar with croutons and white anchovies ($5) or chicken ($7).
For an entree, I ordered the grilled lamb couscous with curried fruit ($12). This is also available as a vegetarian selection. The three generous pieces of lamb were grilled medium-rare with a black pepper coating. They were served on a generous bed of curried vegetable couscous. Also on the plate was an enticingly aromatic collection of dried fruits - apricots, pears, raisins, currants - also cooked in curry. They were pungent, sweet, sticky and divine. Eaten with the rice and couscous, this was a most delicious dish.
My companion ordered the seafood special, scallops and crab meat with Tucson sheep cheese ($15). Eight large scallops and heaps of fresh crab meat filled a plate lined with spinach. It was covered with a sauce of fresh tomatoes, roasted red peppers, shallots, garlic, parsley, lemon juice, wine and balsamic vinegar. The cheese was melted into the dish. It was very rich and equally as delicious.
Other entrees include roasted duck breast with a maple cider glaze ($14), saffron oyster mushrooms with Tucson sheep cheese ($10) and grilled organic tenderloin of beef with a spice rub ($14).
Desserts sit in the case across from diners as a tease throughout the meal. They are spectacular. Each is $5.
I ordered a fruit tart. Fragrant freshly ground almonds filled the rich pastry crust. Kiwi, raspberries and an orange slice decorated the top and were coated with a shiny glaze. The texture of the crust and filling was crumbly and interesting. The tart fruit was the perfect foil for the sweetness. This dessert could be shared by two people.
My companion ordered the lemon butter cream layer cake. Served in a pool of cream anglaise decorated with raspberry sauce, the cake was layered with raspberry filling. Butter creme icing covered the top and sides. Though the butter cream was delightful, the dessert was too sweet for my taste.
Other treats include chocolate hazelnut truffle cake, cheesecake and Linzer torte. Our bill, before tax, tip or drinks, was $62.

Abstract: An entomologist with the Maine Forest Service is predicting that Harpswell will be the hardest hit town next year when browntail moth caterpillars start spreading their toxic hairs. Richard Bradbury recommends spraying more than 5,000 acres in Harpswell, Brunswick, Freeport, Yarmouth and Cumberland next May to eliminate the pesky critters, which he discovered have started to migrate northeast from the islands of Casco Bay. Harpswell is in their path. Bradbury has spent nearly all of December surveying browntail moth caterpillar webs in the five towns. His field work is critical to the towns, which must start planning a line of defense against the browntail onslaught.

Full text: An entomologist with the Maine Forest Service is predicting that Harpswell will be the hardest hit town next year when browntail moth caterpillars start spreading their toxic hairs.
Richard Bradbury recommends spraying more than 5,000 acres in Harpswell, Brunswick, Freeport, Yarmouth and Cumberland next May to eliminate the pesky critters, which he discovered have started to migrate northeast from the islands of Casco Bay. Harpswell is in their path.
"Harpswell is going to have a more intense and widespread problem than in previous years," Bradbury warned.
Bradbury has spent nearly all of December surveying browntail moth caterpillar webs in the five towns. His field work is critical to the towns, which must start planning a line of defense against the browntail onslaught.
The towns met this month in Freeport to discuss strategy. Most probably will follow the lead of Harpswell, which will ask voters at the March town meeting to spend up to $40,000 to pay for an aerial spraying program.
Bradbury braves storms and cold in his search for the white, silken webs where browntail moth larvae spend their winters. Most often he finds the webs -- which can provide shelter for up to 400 larvae -- in the tops of oak or poplar trees at the tips of branches. He uses binoculars and a notepad to count the webs, which indicate the strength of the coming season's population.
When the caterpillars shed their skin -- which they do five times before becoming a moth -- their hairs become airborne. If the hairs come into contact with skin they can cause a severe skin rash similar to poison ivy. If inhaled, the hairs can cause respiratory problems.
In addition to creating health problems, the caterpillars defoliate trees and shrubs. Spraying has been successful on Casco Bay islands off Portland, Bradbury said.
John A. Walsh of Framingham, Mass., who owns a summer home on Birch Island in Harpswell, can attest to the seriousness of the problem that started to show up in the town last year.
"Six trips to the emergency room were necessary for me and guests (last summer). Upon our departure in October we noted an incredible number of their larvae nests, which suggests a very unpleasant 1999 not only on Birch Island, but in all of Harpswell. . . . I trust you will take precautionary measures by spraying," Walsh wrote in a letter to the town recently.
Robert Waddle, chairman of the Harpswell Board of Selectmen, will urge voters to approve spending for an aerial spraying program.
"Last year, we had people who could not stay on the island. Some people had to leave their homes," Waddle said. "It is a serious health issue that I think the town will take in stride."
Bradbury said about 2,000 acres in Harpswell should be sprayed. Densely populated neighborhoods such as Bailey Island, Orrs Island and Cundys Harbor are a few of the areas that will be targeted. Also on the spray list will be Birch Island, Upper Goose Island and Lower Goose Island.
Bradbury is nearly finished with his survey, still needing to do more field work in Brunswick. So far, he has identified browntail moth hot spots in the following areas:
In Cumberland, about 1,000 acres between Middle Road and the coastline, as well as Chebeague Island.
In Yarmouth, about 1,000 acres on Cousins Island, Princes Point and Sunset Point.
In Freeport, about 500 acres east of Route 1, including the Winslow Park neighborhood, South Freeport village, Wolfe's Neck and Flying Point.
Bradbury said a new product could be used this year. Confirm, which is awaiting approval from the Maine Board of Pesticides Control, may replace Dimilin as the pesticide of choice. Dimilin is a petroleum product that has generated controversy because it can damage the shells of lobsters, clams and other shellfish.
Spraying is prohibited within 100 feet of the shoreline. People who do not want their property sprayed have the right to be omitted from the program, Bradbury said.
Browntail moth caterpillars feed on the leaves of hardwood trees and shrubs. Moths are active in July and August, laying clusters of eggs on the underside of leaves. Caterpillars emerge from the eggs in August and form webs.
Caterpillars may reach 1 1/2 inches in length. They are brown with a white stripe on each side and red spots on their backs.

Full text: Jim Brunelle (e-mail: jbrune5049@aol.com) comments on politics and other issues for the Portland Press Herald.
Sometime today, along about when we start ladling out the oyster stew or carving up the traditional roast beef or passing around the Christmas pudding, I plan to raise a toast to the memory of Marjorie Standish.
Marge, who has graced our table -- in spirit if not in person -- for about as long as we've lived here, died last month at age 90. This column is a reprise of one I wrote about her in another publication a few years ago.
Maine cookbooks are a dime a dozen. Well, maybe a couple hundred dollars a dozen, if you shop carefully. The point is they are plentiful.
Some are written by people who don't even live here but know that the word "Maine" on the cover can mean increased sales for any collection of recipes. If it contains a lobster recipe, it's a Maine cookbook.
Some are assembled by committee, published in limited edition as fund-raisers for this or that club or organization.
Although the quality of these spiral-bound efforts can be spotty, they often contain little gastronomic gems as well as big laughs.
As to the latter, my favorite is Barbara Bush's famous baked bean recipe in the Portland Museum of Art cookbook.
You begin by opening a can of baked beans.
Marjorie Standish's cookbooks are of sturdier stock. For 25 years, she wrote a cooking column for the Maine Sunday Telegram and distilled some of the best of her work into two fabulously successful books.
"Cooking Down East," her first book, sold more than 100,000 copies. That may not be in Stephen King's league, but for a local publication it's decidedly in the best-seller range.
Standish was more of an arbiter than an innovator in Maine cooking. Her special talent was to spot the quality and worth of recipes originated by others, test them in her own kitchen and bring together the best of them into an identifiable body of food preparation that can legitimately be styled "Down East."
She kept things simple, wholesome and savory. And she used local ingredients whenever possible because, as she wrote, "in Maine, we like to build our recipes around foods for which we are noted."
The publication in 1973 of her second book, "Keep Cooking the Maine Way," inspired an early column of mine.
I praised the authenticity and art of Standish's cookery, but snootily suggested some of the between-recipes chatter could have been dispensed with.
Shortly after that I ran into the grand lady herself.
"You're not from Maine, are you?" she said.
I had to admit it was true. I am, to my everlasting embarrassment, a native of New Hampshire.
But how, I asked, did she know? "Because a Maine person would understand that people like that chatter. They enjoy the comments and the stories as much as the recipes in my books."
This was a geographical litmus test new to me, but I was in no position to question its legitimacy since it had just unmasked me as a foreigner.
It is true that Maine writers of every stripe love to chatter about food and cooking whenever they get the chance.
Kenneth Roberts, the historical novelist, not only wrote the introduction to a cookbook by his niece, Marjorie Mosser, he also wrote connecting pieces between chapters and contributed favorite recipes of his own.
The result, he said with typical Roberts reserve, "turned out to be the best cookbook ever assembled."
It would serve, he said, as a lively and toothsome reminder "that old recipes, like old friends, are usually most dependable."
And so they are, as a browse through Marjorie Standish's two books makes readily evident.
And if the dependable old standbys call for some ingredients that carry more cholesterol or sodium or what-have-you than today's cooks prefer, substitutes are available.
Most of these recipes are easily adapted without doing violence to the tastiness of the original, although I would caution against arbitrary adaptation.
Changing the tried-and-true, however sensitively done, involves a certain amount of historical revisionism.
Standish's books hold up because they are grounded in a tradition of "good, plain and nourishing food" whose distinction comes from a marriage of geography and philosophy.
So I salute Marge's memory this Christmas morning with feelings of both gratitude and anticipation.
She may be gone, but I expect she'll be filling my dinner table with dependable old Maine dishes for a long time to come.

A small bar is across from the waiting area. Fifteen appetizers are priced from $1.20 to $12.95. The nine soups are $1.50 to $5.25. Entrees including seafood, poultry, pork, beef, vegetables, lo mein, rice, chow mein/chop suey and egg foo young range from $5.50 to $10.95. Eighteen house specialties include Peking duck ($21.95 whole, $11.95 half), Gang of Four ($11.95) a combination of shrimp, scallops, chicken and beef with vegetables stir fried in a brown sauce, and beef with orange flavor ($11.75), deep-fried with tangerine peel in a spicy sauce.

About a mile past the Maine Mall on Payne Road is a small strip of stores. Nestled among them is Chia Sen, a Chinese restaurant that opened last April. While the surroundings are utilitarian, the simple exterior of Chia Sen leads diners into a warm interior.
Pale yellow walls complement the teal and gold carpets, teal window blinds, tabletops and upholstery. Blond wood table and chair frames are light and modern. Framed pieces of Chinese art decorate the walls. The dining area is L-shaped and has enough room for 70 diners. In the entry is a comfortable lounge area with chairs and magazines. A small bar is across from the waiting area.
The midweek night we visited, the restaurant was quiet. Our waiter was most helpful and polite -- though we know he was amused that we ordered so much food. We asked him to pace the courses, and he did a great job.
After we placed our order, a bowl of freshly fried broad noodles was presented, along with duck sauce and a pot of tea. The noodles were excellent, and we were tempted to eat too many before dinner.
The menu is extensive. All dishes are prepared without MSG.
Fifteen appetizers are priced from $1.20 to $12.95. The nine soups are $1.50 to $5.25. Entrees including seafood, poultry, pork, beef, vegetables, lo mein, rice, chow mein/chop suey and egg foo young range from $5.50 to $10.95. Eighteen house specialties include Peking duck ($21.95 whole, $11.95 half), Gang of Four ($11.95) a combination of shrimp, scallops, chicken and beef with vegetables stir fried in a brown sauce, and beef with orange flavor ($11.75), deep-fried with tangerine peel in a spicy sauce.
There is a listing of four lighter side offerings. Lower in calories and fat, they include boiled mixed vegetables ($7.95), with chicken ($8.50) or shrimp ($9.75). And there is a children's menu (all $6.95) with beef, chicken teriyaki, spring rolls, shrimp toast and rice in the shape of an animal.
I began with crab meat and corn soup ($4.50 for two). The base was thick, pale white and crammed with corn, frozen peas and carrots, egg white and imitation crab. The flavor was as pale as the color. The crab could have been crabbier, and the carrots overpowered the other flavors. This was an OK version.
My companion ordered the wonton soup ($1.50). It, too, had a weak flavor in spite of the two large wontons and the scallions floating in the bowl.
We tried the pan-fried meat dumplings ($4.50 for six). They were substantial, stuffed with a delicious meat filling and served with a tasty sauce of soy dipping sauce.
We also ordered the mini vegetable spring rolls ($2.95 for six). Crunchy and steaming hot, they contained cabbage and carrot but not a lot of flavor.
The steamed wontons with hot sesame sauce ($3.50) had a wonderful sticky texture and were served with a zippy peanut and onion sauce.
Two scallion pancakes ($3.25 for six) were deep-fried to crispy and were filled with scallions. I found them a bit greasy.
A generous plate of tender and tasty honey boneless spareribs ($5.50) was succulent.
We selected three entrees: shrimp wor bar ($13.50), chicken with snow pea pods ($7.75), and Buddha Delight with bean curd ($6.95).
The wor bar contained 15 large, fresh sweet shrimp, baby corn, pea pods, red pepper and mushrooms. It had a mild ginger flavor and was served on a sizzling hot plate over a bed of sweet rice cakes that had been deep-fried. It was delicious.
The chicken with snow pea pods had lots of snow white chicken meat, crunchy pea pods, water chestnuts, carrots and bok choy. This dish had great color.
The Buddha Delight with bean curd was a festive mix of vegetables - - fresh broccoli, carrot, baby corn, water chestnuts, mushrooms, and pea pods -- along with lots of tofu. The tofu was light, not heavy or compacted, and it was a nice addition to the crunchy, colorful vegetables. This dish was also in a mild white sauce.
Entrees came with plain white or fried rice. The latter was a really wonderful version, jazzed up with a lot of black pepper.
Other entrees include sesame pork ($7.75), beef in oyster sauce ($8.75), scallops in black bean sauce ($10.95), and eggplant in garlic sauce ($6.50).
Our bill, before tax, tip or drinks was $52.

Abstract: The town's effort to control the increasing use of its waterfront met with strong opposition from boat owners, marina owners, clam diggers and others at a hearing Tuesday. The hearing was on new waterfront regulations that would, among other things, increase the cost of moorings and make it harder for some people to get moorings. Some opponents criticized the cost increases as too extreme, particularly for marina owners who would see the annual fee for each of their moorings rise from $80 to $650.

Full text: The town's effort to control the increasing use of its waterfront met with strong opposition from boat owners, marina owners, clam diggers and others at a hearing Tuesday.
The hearing was on new waterfront regulations that would, among other things, increase the cost of moorings and make it harder for some people to get moorings.
Some opponents criticized the cost increases as too extreme, particularly for marina owners who would see the annual fee for each of their moorings rise from $80 to $650.
Others blasted a proposal to forbid moorings from being passed down generation to generation.
The Town Council responded to the opposition by postponing a vote on the regulations and scheduling another hearing.
"A harbor of the size and shape we have cannot possibly meet everybody's needs," said David Soley, the council chairman. "We're trying to balance all the competing needs in this town in a way that makes sense."
The town's Coastal Waters Commission has worked on the regulations for nearly four years.
The changes are needed because the town's growing population, combined with growing crowds of boaters visiting during the summer, threaten the town's scenic harbor with overcrowding.
For example, one marina owner said his number of nightly mooring rentals has increased from 90 in 1992 to 450 last summer.
But change does not come easily, particularly when it involves changing the way people use the waterfront they love both for its beauty and its economic opportunities.
"It's a hot issue," said Carol Chipman, the chairwoman of the Coastal Waters Commission. "People don't like change, and this is a lot of change all at once. But it becomes obvious to us daily that if we are going to protect our marvelous ocean resource, we must act boldly."
Garrett Simmons, a local shellfisherman, opposed a new regulation that would limit the size and the horsepower of the boats that clammers tie up at the town dock.
The goal of the regulation is to clear room for more boats at the dock. But Simmons said it's one more example of commercial fishermen getting shoved off of the waterfront they depend on for their livelihood.
Vincent Migliaccion, who owns waterfront property and has a mooring, criticized the plan to forbid families from passing on mooring rights.
The goal of the change is to give everybody a fair chance to get the moorings, which are in such demand that a new applicant today must wait about four years to get one.
But Migliaccion said, "People who own waterfront property pay top dollar in taxes. They ought to be able to put their boats in the water."
George Waterman, a recreational boater with a mooring, said the proposed increase in mooring fees is too steep, particularly for marinas. Recreational boaters would see their fee for a mooring increase from $20 a year to $60 a year, far less than the increase marina owners face.
"I don't like to see those who are trying to make a living carry an unfair burden," he said.
Several councilors agreed with the critics. Councilor Ed Campbell said he would not support such a steep fee increase. Councilor Ken Mann said the restrictions on the size and horsepower of clam digger's boats appears to be unfair.
The council will next discuss the rules Jan. 7 at 7 p.m. at the town library.

Abstract: A couple of daily specials were on the board. They included cream of carrot and turkey soups ($1.99 cup/$2.99 bowl), scallops au gratin ($11.25) and chicken breast marinara ($8.95 for one breast/$9.95 for two). The dinner menu is small -- eight entrees ($6.95 - $12.95). There are no appetizers other than soups and salads. The all-you can- eat salad bar may be purchased as a meal (adults $4.95/$6.29 with a cup of soup, $3.99 children 12 and under). Breakfast and lunch selections are available throughout the dinner hours. So are muffins, which are a specialty of the house. To begin, I ordered the lobster stew (market price; $6.50 cup/ $8.95 bowl the night I visited). This version was crammed with pieces of sweet lobster meat. The cream/butter combination was rich and subtly flavored. The bowl was garnished with parsley and decorated with paprika. I enjoyed this soup, which was served with oyster crackers. My companion ordered the onion soup. A large crock was filled with a strong and salty onion mixture. It was topped with bread croutons and mozzarella cheese. After being run under the broiler, it emerged brown and bubbly. The flavor wasn't bad, but there were too many croutons jamming the bowl for my taste.

The Freeport Cafe is quintessential New England -- quaint and compact. The ceiling is low, and the place is laid out in a way that provides nooks and crannies. It lends to a feeling of privacy.
The wainscoted walls are painted stark white, while the woodwork and high backed benches are painted pale green. There are windows all around, hanging plants and interesting punched-tin lamps suspended over the tables. The atmosphere is warm and casual.
The Sunday night we visited, the pace was slow. About half of the 14 tables were filled.
A couple of daily specials were on the board. They included cream of carrot and turkey soups ($1.99 cup/$2.99 bowl), scallops au gratin ($11.25) and chicken breast marinara ($8.95 for one breast/$9.95 for two). The dinner menu is small -- eight entrees ($6.95 - $12.95). There are no appetizers other than soups and salads.

To begin, I ordered the lobster stew (market price; $6.50 cup/ $8.95 bowl the night I visited). This version was crammed with pieces of sweet lobster meat. The cream/butter combination was rich and subtly flavored. The bowl was garnished with parsley and decorated with paprika. I enjoyed this soup, which was served with oyster crackers.
My companion ordered the onion soup. A large crock was filled with a strong and salty onion mixture. It was topped with bread croutons and mozzarella cheese. After being run under the broiler, it emerged brown and bubbly. The flavor wasn't bad, but there were too many croutons jamming the bowl for my taste.
My companion opted for the salad from the salad bar. It's offered with dinner entrees. The lettuce was iceberg, and it had seen better times. Pale, brown-edged and wilted, it was surrounded by fresher offerings of beets, celery, shredded carrots, raisins, cherry tomatoes, sunflower seeds, croutons and a variety of dressings, none of which was homemade.
I tried a side of the homemade cole slaw ($1), a colorful, fresh and crunchy dish which is also available on the salad bar. This version had red and green cabbage, carrot and parsley. The dressing was zippy.
We sampled two muffins, blueberry and bran, which we requested grilled. The blueberry had a good amount of berries but was a bit sweet. The bran was a hearty and moist variety.
I ordered the shrimp scampi ($12.99). Seven large shrimp topped a big bowl of pasta served in an oversized soup plate. While the shrimp were OK, the linguine was lacking in sauce. I could taste lemon, and there was a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, but the pasta was basically dry. The server told me the dish is usually saucier and that she wasn't sure why it was dry.
My companion ordered the traditional turkey dinner. The plate was huge with two large slices of white turkey meat, not from a carved bird. The processed meat had a soft consistency and was very salty. The mashed potatoes were homemade and quite good. The stuffing, not homemade, was highly spiced. Copious amounts of gravy washed over all the food. The plate was garnished with a lettuce leaf and a slice of cranberry sauce.
Other entrees include homemade turkey pie ($7.99), Yankee pot roast ($8.49), baked lasagna ($6.99), grilled breast of chicken ($7.47 small/$9.49 large), and vegetable stir fry ($6.99/$8.99 with chicken).
Dessert choices include pies ($2.69/$2.99 a la mode), ice cream or sherbet ($1.99), cookies (79 cents), Indian pudding, and apple crisp with vanilla ice cream ($2.79 each).
While the pies are not made at the restaurant, they are made locally. I ordered the raspberry, warmed up and topped with vanilla ice cream. It was really good; the crust was flaky, the raspberry filling generous and tasty, and the ice cream was a good quality.
My companion's apple crisp was also a good choice. The crunchy topping was made of flour, butter and spices. The apples slices were real. The dish was served warm and was enhanced by the addition of vanilla ice cream.
Our server never asked if we wanted coffee, and I had to remind her to bring the cole slaw. Overall, her casual demeanor would have benefited from some professional polish. But she removed the charge for desserts from our bill because of the sauce-less linguine. She told us she wanted us to be happy and to return.
Our bill, before tax, tip or drinks, was $36.

Abstract: Maine agencies want the Julie N's owner to make amends by improving the environment and increasing public access to the waterfront. They are designing several restoration projects based on a just-completed two-year study of how the spill affected the state's natural resources and residents. The report describes the damage to 25 acres of salt marsh, the killing of 27 cormorants, gulls and other birds, and the loss of 1,380 visits to a city walking trail and boat launch. Tests on clams, mussels and lobsters showed elevated levels of hydrocarbon pollution. State officials and environmental advocates now see the damage claim as a way to reduce hydrocarbon pollution that routinely washes into the harbor, increase the amount of salt marsh habitat in the region and create new public trails along the Fore River.

Full text: The state is preparing a final damage claim for the 180,000- gallon oil spill in Portland Harbor two years ago, but it won't simply ask for money.
Maine agencies want the Julie N's owner to make amends by improving the environment and increasing public access to the waterfront. They are designing several restoration projects based on a just-completed two-year study of how the spill affected the state's natural resources and residents.
The report describes the damage to 25 acres of salt marsh, the killing of 27 cormorants, gulls and other birds, and the loss of 1,380 visits to a city walking trail and boat launch. Tests on clams, mussels and lobsters showed elevated levels of hydrocarbon pollution.
"Any time you have a substantial spill, there's going to be some injury," said Paul Van Cott, regional director of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. "Even though we did a great job cleaning up here, we left almost 40,000 gallons of oil in the system."
State officials and environmental advocates now see the damage claim as a way to reduce hydrocarbon pollution that routinely washes into the harbor, increase the amount of salt marsh habitat in the region and create new public trails along the Fore River.
"The next step is really for us to propose something to the responsible party," Van Cott said.
Maine's damage claim proposal could be sent to the tanker owner, Amity Product Carriers Inc., by the end of the month, he said. After negotiating a final settlement, the remediation projects could start next year. Amity's attorney handling the negotiations did not return phone calls Tuesday.
Amity also is responsible for paying for the study, which involved state and federal agencies and a private contractor. Although the costs have not been settled, the combination of the restoration projects and the study itself is expected to cost the company several million dollars.
Nearly 180,000 gallons of oil spilled into the harbor Sept. 27, 1996, when the Julie N slammed into the old Portland Bridge and ripped a gash in its hull. It was the worst oil spill in the harbor's history.
Amity, which had been represented by Maritime Overseas Corp. during the cleanup, has settled nearly all of the outstanding private damage claims from businesses, fishermen and boat owners. It has paid more than $50 million to clean the spill and settle claims.
Federal law requires companies responsible for a spill to study the impacts and negotiate public remediation projects.
The state's damage claim will focus on three general impacts outlined in the study: pollution of the harbor's marine environment, damage to birds and their salt marsh habitat, and loss of access to the public.
It will propose the construction of a stormwater treatment system to capture and clean runoff from Portland's streets. The technology would reduce the same type of hydrocarbon pollution that the Julie N dumped into the marine environment.
Tests after the spill showed polyaromatic hydrocarbons in the flesh of mussels and clams and in some local lobsters. State health officials determined the levels of contaminants in lobsters did not pose a public health threat, but "it certainly raised some flags as a situation that needs to be monitored," said Seth Barker of the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
Although the Julie N was partly to blame, chemical tests showed much of the contamination was from other sources and had already been there. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons can come directly from oil spills in the harbor, from oil or gasoline washed off city streets, or even from particles in car exhaust that settle onto the ground or water surface. Treating runoff will reduce a major source, officials said.
"If we take that out we can protect the harbor and the bay on a daily basis," said Joseph Payne, director of Friends of Casco Bay.
Another proposed project is the restoration of salt marsh to the west of Route 1 in Scarborough.
The 100-acre section of the Scarborough Marsh once was a similar habitat to the Fore River marshes that were damaged by the spill. The construction of Route 1, however, cut off the flow of saltwater and the area has been taken over by freshwater vegetation, including cattails.
Maine's Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department wants to bring more saltwater under Route 1, perhaps with a second culvert, and gradually reclaim the habitat for birds that travel between the Scarborough Marsh and the Fore River.
The state also is expected to propose that Amity pay to construct a mile-long public walking trail along the north side of the Fore River between Congress Street and Thompson Point. It was a section of shoreline blackened by oil in 1996 and a critical link in a future trail around the peninsula.
"It will give people greater access to the waterfront just like the Eastern Prom trail did," said Alex Hopkins, director of Portland Trails.
OIL SPILL CLAIM
Damage to natural resources and other public impacts of the Sept. 27, 1996, oil spill in Portland Harbor are the subject of a new state report. The report will be the foundation for a damage claim calling for the oil tanker's owner to make environmental and public access improvements.
The entire report can be viewed at the Department of Environmental Protection's Portland office, the Portland and South Portland public libraries or on the DEP's website (www.state.me.us/dep).
Impacts identified in the report include:
25.61 acres of salt marsh were oiled in the Fore River, with 14.65 moderately or heavily damaged.
Lobsters, mussels and clams had elevated levels of potentially carcinogenic hydrocarbons, though not all of the pollution was from the Julie N. State health officials said the levels in lobster did not pose a public health threat. Shellfish are not harvested in the harbor.
1,679 birds were seen with oil showing on their feathers; 87 of them were heavily oiled; 27 birds were killed, mostly cormorants and gulls.
1,380 trips to Waynflete School's public walking trail and to the Portland boat launch were lost when both were closed.
About 124 fishing charter and party boat trips were lost due to fishing closures.
About 4,862 boating trips were lost when the harbor was closed.
Potential remediation projects that may be part of the state's damage claim include:
Construction of a stormwater treatment facility in Portland to keep hydrocarbons from washing into the harbor from city streets.
Restoration of a salt marsh in Scarborough that once offered a similar habitat for birds.
Creation of a mile-long trail along the Fore River to improve public access.

Abstract: People in West Bath and Brunswick are angry at the prospect that out-of-town companies will reap the benefits of the work they have done to clean up New Meadows lake. "That's the only natural resource that West Bath has and we're giving it away? And the diggers are proud of themselves and they've kept it going." said Ralph Merry, a selectman in West Bath, which shares the New Meadows lake with Brunswick. While the new state marine commissioner, George Lapointe, has not made a final decision on the leases, Brunswick has protested the preliminary recommendation and the town attorney has asked to discuss the matter with him. Sen. Mary Small, who represents West Bath, said she intended to file legislation to alter the way the state approves leases.

Full text: People in West Bath and Brunswick are angry at the prospect that out-of-town companies will reap the benefits of the work they have done to clean up New Meadows lake.
An administrator at the Department of Marine Resources last month recommended granting two 10-year leases to private companies to harvest clams from part of the lake, which is not a natural lake but a dammed ocean inlet.
If the leases are awarded, local clam diggers would be banned from working in the area.
"That's the only natural resource that West Bath has and we're giving it away? And the diggers are proud of themselves and they've kept it going." said Ralph Merry, a selectman in West Bath, which shares the New Meadows lake with Brunswick.
While the new state marine commissioner, George Lapointe, has not made a final decision on the leases, Brunswick has protested the preliminary recommendation and the town attorney has asked to discuss the matter with him. Sen. Mary Small, who represents West Bath, said she intended to file legislation to alter the way the state approves leases.
State rental agreements are permitted to allow the farming of marine species.
Aquaculture Administrator Laurice Churchill recommended the New Meadows leases for the upper portion of the lake because those waters were classified as "restricted." That means they were too polluted for conventional clam digging, but clean enough to allow digging for shellfish that would be purified in sterile water with a process called "depuration."
Spinney Creek Shellfish Inc. of Eliot, one of the lease applicants, has the only depuration plant in the state, said its vice president, Lori Howell.
Representatives from Brunswick and West Bath have argued that the lake waters are so clean that depuration is unnecessary.
Diggers, town officials and lawyers testified in May that the towns had worked to get rid of septic system leaks and upgrade the pollution classification.
"The top part pretty well is clean right now," said Ronald Beal, chairman of the selectmen in West Bath, which has about 22 resident diggers.
"If there is pollution, it's something that could be addressed and fixed in a short period of time," he said. "We need the income. Why should the state come in and grant these leases to somebody from out of the area?"
For years both sections of New Meadows lake, which is divided by Route 1 into upper and lower portions, were considered too polluted for harvesting, said Alan Houston, the natural resources planner in Brunswick, where there are 63 commercial diggers.
The state upgraded the status of both sections last year. The lower portion, about 30 acres, became "open," which meant licensed harvesters could take clams and sell them. The upper acres, about 75, were rated as "restricted."
The state employee in charge of the ratings said he would like another year of water samples before he considers whether a change is warranted.
"It's not doomed forever," said Paul Anderson, director of public health at the Department of Marine Resources.
If the leases are granted, however, the area would be off-limits to local harvesters for 10 years.
Andrew Johnson, who works with Spinney Creek, has applied for the second lake lease. If Johnson and Spinney Creek both win approval, they would split most of the upper portion of the lake, harvest quahogs and apply seed clams and oysters. Each lessee would have about 30 acres and pay $50 per year for each acre.
A 10-year agreement is necessary for the seeders to get a return on their investment, as it takes four to eight years for clams to get big enough to harvest, said Howell, of Spinney Creek.
If the leases are granted, the towns can fight the decision by filing a lawsuit. West Bath, which has spent $1,000 in attorneys' fees so far, could not afford to invest much more, said Beal. Brunswick has not decided, said Houston.
Small, R-Bath, and Rep. Judith Peavey, R-Woolwich, say the lease- altering legislation they plan would force officials to consider whether polluted water is on the verge of being clean.
"Here is a community that works very hard for a resource and they get very little for their trouble," Small said.
Merry said he didn't understand why the opinions of townspeople didn't seem to have more influence with the state. "There had to be a good 40 of us that stood and spoke against giving this lease out," he said.

Abstract: The good professor explained that his information was based on documents written by Governor Bradford in listing exactly what was served on that day when 90 Indians had been invited to join the Plymouth Colony's three-day feast. Bradford failed to specify that there had been turkey on the table. I find it hard to believe that he managed to write a menu at all. When the Indians began to plant grain the turkeys flocked to the gardens with great enthusiasm. It was necessary to post guards to chase the birds away; then the turkeys became expert at getting into the granaries. Unable to protect their grain, the Indians shut up the birds instead --- after that, they had to provide them with food and living quarters. It is possible to hear from a few malcontents that eating the same meal every November is boring. On the other hand, there are those who look forward to exactly the same dishes they have eaten every year as long as they can remember. Since the holiday was created in New England, it was a simple, home-style feast with roast turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed vegetables, cider, pies and plum pudding. However, during the Victorian era, elegance was the word. This was the 1887 menu in Woman's Home Companion:

There was a minor flap some time back when a university professor claimed that turkey was not, after all, eaten at the first Thanksgiving.
That statement gained a lot of coverage in the Thursday morning newspapers when there is so little that can be said that hasn't turned into turkey, rehashed over the past century.
The good professor explained that his information was based on documents written by Governor Bradford in listing exactly what was served on that day when 90 Indians had been invited to join the Plymouth Colony's three-day feast. Bradford failed to specify that there had been turkey on the table. I find it hard to believe that he managed to write a menu at all.
The professor failed to note that Edward Winslow, one of the original Mayflower passengers, clearly recorded that turkeys had been hunted successfully for the first Thanksgiving:
"Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might, after a special manner, rejoice together after we had gathered the fruit of our labors. They four in one day killed as much fowl as, with a little help beside, served the company almost a week."
Thomas Morton wrote, ". . . . turkies there are, which divers times in great flocks have sallied by our doores; and then a gunne, being commonly in a rediness, salutes them with such a courtesie, as makes them take a turne in the Cooke room."
It was also reported that the Indians brought turkeys with them for the first feast.
It may be quite possible that the Pilgrim fathers didn't have to hunt them. Jean M. Pinkley, in her book " Who Domesticated Whom?" writes, "To say that the Indians domesticated the turkey is to put the cart before the horse. He had no choice; it was the turkey which domesticated him."
When the Indians began to plant grain the turkeys flocked to the gardens with great enthusiasm. It was necessary to post guards to chase the birds away; then the turkeys became expert at getting into the granaries. Unable to protect their grain, the Indians shut up the birds instead --- after that, they had to provide them with food and living quarters.
Clever birds, turkeys.
It is possible to hear from a few malcontents that eating the same meal every November is boring. On the other hand, there are those who look forward to exactly the same dishes they have eaten every year as long as they can remember. Since the holiday was created in New England, it was a simple, home-style feast with roast turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed vegetables, cider, pies and plum pudding. However, during the Victorian era, elegance was the word. This was the 1887 menu in Woman's Home Companion:
Raw oysters
Turtle Soup
Boiled Fish with Anchovy Sauce
Roast Turkey, Giblet Sauce
Smothered Guinea Fowl
Chicken Pie
Roast Haunch of Venison
Mashed Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes
Mashed Turnips, Cauliflower
Boiled Onions
Baked Salsify
Cabbage Salad
Cranberry Sauce
Celery
Sweet Peach Pickle
Pumpkin Pie, Mince Pie
Thanksgiving Pudding
Ice Cream, Thanksgiving Cake
Crackers , Cheese, Pickles
Fruit, Oranges, Grapes
Over the years, the menu became even more elaborate. By the early 1900's, the menus were in the French style, starting with Buzzard Bay Huitres, (oysters) followed by a puree of game, and then hors d'oeuvres. After that, lobster, filet of venison with artichokes, jellied pate of goose livers (with truffles) and then turkey decorated with glazed chestnuts. Desserts was "a Thanksgiving monument of ice cream."
Finally Thanksgiving returned to its humble beginnings with cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie. Fannie Farmer wrote, " What hopes center on the golden-brown turkey; the flaky pastry, the spicy plum pudding. Surely no American will forego these traditional dishes on this traditional day . . . ."

Full text: Natalie Brenner has been observing and writing about the social scene for the Maine Sunday Telegram for 19 years.
The annual art auction is an all-win event.
As chairman Candace Karu said, the Maine College of Art students receive scholarship money, artists are able to show their works to many potential buyers, and the collectors themselves have many pieces to choose from.
The college's 24th auction earned gross profits of $80,000. The proceeds will provide financial assistance to about 85 percent of the student body.
Bidding began with a silent auction on the second floor of the former Porteous building. The large, unfinished space will eventually house the Joanne Waxman Library. The name commemorates the college's first professional librarian, who led the development of the art library.
Russell Lamar, a senior sculpture student, introduced the live auction with a few words to the crowd. He told the 300 assembled art enthusiasts, "Without the help of people like you, I wouldn't be here today . . . struggling." He went on to thank everyone on behalf of himself and his fellow students.
After President Roger Gilmore welcomed the bidding guests, Lamar and school official Tim Kane drew a winning raffle ticket. The luck of the draw meant $10,000 to Margaret Lawrence, a Maine College of Art graduate. Lawrence, in turn, bought the first offering in the live auction. Her purchase was "Beach Stones" by Allan Gardiner, the late head of the printmaking department.
With Tom Saturley in charge of all the bidding, board chairman David Robinson ultimately bought a bowl. The earthenware bowl by ceramics department head Mark Johnson was presented to Karu. She also received thanks for chairing the auction two years in a row.
Auction highlights were many.
"Bravo," a bronze sculpture by John Raimondi, brought the highest bid of the day: $12,000.
Alfred "Chip" Chadbourn's oil painting, "Flowers on Stove," sold for $7,000.
Claude Montgomery's portrayal of Spanish fishing boats earned $3,600. Nancy Montgomery Beebe donated that painting by her late father, an alumnus.
"Flotsam in Allagash" doesn't sound romantic, but it sort of is. A bidder bought the Neil Welliver woodcut as an engagement gift, spending $3,100.
A Charles Hewitt print went for $2,400, with half the amount turned over to the printmaking department to invest in a new press.
Christine Gardner managed to stage a bidding war. Her watercolor, valued at $250, sold for $825.
Among browsers and buyers circulating in the loft were Bob Crispin, Ken and Martha Lane, Josiah Adams, Nancy Davidson, and Mark and Aimee Bessire. Mark is the new director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, located downstairs in the same building.
IT WAS FIRST class, all the way, for tourists aboard the travel showcase.
The point of departure was The Pavilion, where Hurley Travel Services and Whip & Spoon cookware paired an evening of cuisine plus auction. Proceeds will benefit the Lee Perry Memorial Fund established by Youth Alternatives. Perry, a longtime board member, also served as board chairman. The fund will provide such extras as summer camp stays and educational programs for children served by Youth Alternatives.
Passports permitted guests to gather information at 12 travel booths while sampling wine. Everyone's immediate destinations were the food tables where "international" chefs offered their specialties. Richard's Restaurant of Brunswick served bratwurst over sauerkraut. Gritty McDuff's presented popular shepherd's pie. Brian Boru Public House let diners try braised beef stew and oyster stew. Maria's Ristorante tempted tasters with meatballs Florentine and Sicilian cannoli.
Tom Saturley, busy auctioneer, had 19 vacation trips to sell. A Paris whirl earned top dollars, $5,500. Lou McNally took time out from weather reporting to announce some special winners. Sandy Bennett won the grand prize, a deluxe Disney Cruise Line vacation for two. Blake and Gibson Wilkes were the "Choose Your Destination" winners. Their choice was a trip to Hawaii.
David Moser assisted his wife, Pam Hurley Moser, with travel showcase details. Noel Perry was there to support the fund-raiser honoring her late husband. Among others taking the tour were Laurie Banks, Gordon and Robin Chibroski, Rick and Karen Proctor, Susanne and Robin Liller and Barbara Cole.
THE FIRST STOP for Portland theater-goers was a home in Westbrook.
For the third consecutive year, Steve Barton was host at a reception to benefit both the Maine Chapter of the National Sclerosis Society and the Mad Horse Theatre. Barton's co-host, for the first time, was his recent bride, the former Ellen Corson. Ellen's theatrical performances are with "Instant Comedy," a team regularly seen at the Comedy Connection.
Delmar Dustin Small, pianist, entertained as guests selected hors d'oeuvres and beverages at the buffet. Floral decorations were created by Harmon's & Barton's, of course. After the party, the crowd headed eastward to Mad Horse for "Angels in America, Part Two."
The theater "delegation" at the Bartons' included Andrew Sokoloff, Joan Sand and J.D. Merritt. Kathy Wiklund and Jonathan Carr are members of the board. Susan Greenwood, executive director of the MS Society, was there with her husband, Brian. Among others attending were Denise Morin, Cary and Bette Smart, Lee Auchincloss, Todd Greenquist and Crandall Toothaker. Also stopping by were newlyweds Dr. Howard Kessler and Joan Herzog-Kessler. Joan, a dietitian, writes a weekly column in the Portland Press Herald.

Full text: Correction published November 6, 1998: Timothy Downs received more votes than any other candidate in the Scarborough Town Council election. A story Wednesday on Page 3B said he came in second. It was a reporter's error.
Voters elected Sally Temm and Timothy Downs to the Town Council Tuesday.
It is Temm's third consecutive term and Downs' first term.
Temm is 47 years old and the assistant director of Catholic Charities Maine Support and Recovery Services. She is particularly concerned about continued residential growth and how to balance that growth.
She received 2,198 votes.
Her re-election makes her the longest-serving member of the council, something she has said is important.
She plans to focus on balancing growth in Scarborough.
Downs, a 37-year-old commercial clam digger, came in second, with 2,809 votes. He is a former member of the town Shellfish Committee, Open Space Committee and Planning Board.
He resigned from those boards April 20, saying he did not have enough time to properly serve on them.
He frequently attends council meetings, and is well known in town.
During the campaign, he said he dislikes a special type of zoning exception called "contract zoning." Under that zoning, businesses can move to areas where they otherwise would not be permitted if they make special agreements with the town.
State Rep. Robert Pendleton came in third, with 1,963 votes. Pendleton could not run for re-election to the House because he lost the Republican primary. Camilla Barrantes came in fourth with 1,774 votes.
Jeffrey Messer, a former councilor, received 1,178 write-in votes.
Messer quit the council last March. He was chairman at the time. Because of his departure, the town held a special election in May. Kate Borduas was elected to fill his term.
Borduas' term expires next year.

Abstract: All four candidates are reasonably well-known in Scarborough [Marsh]: Camilla Barrantes is a former School Board chairman. Timothy Downs, a commercial clam-digger, served on several town committees. Robert Pendleton is a state representative. Sally Temm is a member and former chairman of the council. When Barrantes, who is 46, chaired the School Board and Temm chaired the council, those boards frequently met together to work out any differences. Both Barrantes and Temm want to bring back those sessions, for which the town won an award from the Institute for Civic Leadership. Downs has scant political experience. He served on the town Shellfish Committee, Open Space Committee and Planning Board, but resigned April 20. In his resignation letter, he said, "The time needed to properly serve on these positions has been extremely detrimental to my family and things of that nature."

Full text: The Town Council has been a contentious board lately, but despite the acrimony, four people are running for two open seats.
All four candidates agree that managing growth is the biggest challenge facing Scarborough, and they all say they want to help heal the fractured council.
The campaign, however, has been free of the testiness and anger that have marked several council meetings.
All four candidates are reasonably well-known in Scarborough: Camilla Barrantes is a former School Board chairman. Timothy Downs, a commercial clam-digger, served on several town committees. Robert Pendleton is a state representative. Sally Temm is a member and former chairman of the council.
Barrantes, the former School Board chairman, is a stay-at-home mom who is particularly interested in educational issues. She also is concerned about open space issues and zoning issues.
When Barrantes, who is 46, chaired the School Board and Temm chaired the council, those boards frequently met together to work out any differences. Both Barrantes and Temm want to bring back those sessions, for which the town won an award from the Institute for Civic Leadership.
"One of the things I bring is the experience of moving from conflict to cooperation between the board of education and the Town Council," she said. "Having differences of opinion on the Town Council or actually any board is really important because then you get a fuller view of the factors that play into an issue. . . But you also have to be able to avoid out-and-out conflict."
She worries about tax burden, especially on people in Pine Point.
"The tax burden has been high, particularly because of revaluation, and I'd like to see if there's a way that can be addressed," she said.
Timothy Downs is running because he is worried about the town's growth.
The 37-year-old Scarborough High School graduate said the school budget, which is controversial almost every year, is another major issue.
Downs has scant political experience. He served on the town Shellfish Committee, Open Space Committee and Planning Board, but resigned April 20. In his resignation letter, he said, "The time needed to properly serve on these positions has been extremely detrimental to my family and things of that nature."
He said he now has the time.
"I've known for the last few years that I wanted to run for the council," he said.
Downs particularly dislikes a special type of zoning exception called "Contract Zoning." Under that zoning, businesses can move to areas where they otherwise would not be permitted if they make special agreements with the town.
"I hate the idea of it in the residential areas," he said. "I'm not really fond of it in any zone, but a compromise in my opinion would be nothing in the residential areas."
Downs also wants to address development around the Scarborough Marsh.
Robert Pendleton is a state representative who cannot run for re- election because he lost the Republican primary. After that, he turned his eye to town politics.
"I've always been really interested in town politics ever since I served on the Town Hall Building Committee," he said.
Pendleton, who is 58, works as a lobsterman during the day, and has run a low-key campaign.
He said his legislative experience provides him a special insight into governing.
"It brings knowledge of what can happen to you and what is probably going to happen to you from Augusta," he said. "One of the biggest factors in all town government now is how much money do you get for general aid to education, aid to your roads and all of that."
Like the other candidates, he is concerned about growth.
In fact, sprawl has been considerable during Pendleton's 23 years in Scarborough.
What used to be a field near his back yard is now a nine-house development. What used to be a pig farm across the street is now a 32- house development.
"Do we have the infrastructure to take care of it?" he asked. "The sewer and water?"
Pendleton said he is "interested in the overall aspects of town government and its growth and its schools."
The final candidate is Sally Temm, who has served two terms on the council.
Temm, who is 47, is the assistant director of Catholic Charities Maine Support and Recovery Services.
She said she is running "because I've learned a lot in the past six years, and there are some issues going on that I really want to stay involved in, and will regardless of whether I'm re-elected."
The issue: the continued residential growth and balancing that growth.
Temm is particularly proud of her work as chairman of the Town Council's Finance Committee.
"The collaborative work with the School Board over a period of two years was very rewarding, and that actually was used as a model in other communities," she said.
If Temm is re-elected, she will be the longest-serving member of the council, something she says is important.
"Holding some historical perspective is important," she said.
Temm also said she does not bring any particular agenda to the council.
"The first time I was elected I didn't come with an agenda," she said, "and I'm not running with a personal agenda now."

Edgar A. Miller Sr., 69, a commercial fisherman who enjoyed tinkering with mechanical things, died Monday at the Maine Veterans Home in Augusta.
A Marine Corps veteran, Mr. Miller did a tour of duty in the Korean War. After his discharge he returned to his native St. Mary's, Ga., and worked as a shrimp fisherman for a few years.
In 1961, he married Judith M. Nickles in Key West, Fla., and in 1968 they moved to Rockland. He moved to Oyster River Road here 21 years ago.
Mr. Miller continued to work in the fishing industry after coming to Maine. He was a mate on commercial vessels out of Rockland for several years, and he also was a lobsterman and a scalloper on boats out of Portland.
He retired in the early 1970s because of ill health, and since then, had enjoyed working around the house, particularly in the garden and on mechanical items.
"He was an outdoorsman," said his wife, Judith M. Miller of Warren. In the winter, he couldn't wait for the snow to fly so he could go out and start plowing snow around. He loved to mow lawns."
"He enjoyed his vegetable garden," said his wife. "He wouldn't let me in, because I didn't have the green thumb like he had. He raised tomatoes, potatoes, green beans, swiss chard. He'd give away most of the produce, to friends and family, whoever needed them."
Mr. Miller was known by family and friends as the "gadget man," said his wife. "He was very mechanically minded. He did a little bit of everything. If something in the house needed to be fixed, he'd get it working. In the summer he'd make me little picket fences for my flower bed."
"Others brought their items, such as lawn mowers, to him to be repaired. He wouldn't take any money for it, as long as they said `thank you.' "
Mr. Miller loved all types of fishing, and he tuned in to any kind of fishing show on television. He also was a fan of heavyweight wrestling.
Born in St. Mary's, Ga., he was a son of Frank M. and Vedra McKendree Miller.
A son, Charles B., died in 1981.
Surviving are his wife, Judith M. of Warren; two sons, Edgar A. Jr. of Warren and Frank A. of Rockville, Conn.; three daughters, Vedra F. Miller of Warren, Manola I. Porter of Thomaston and Tonia M. Gray of Cushing; two brothers, Frank M. Miller Jr. of Monks Corner, S.C., and Hilliard Miller of Savannah, Ga.; 19 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
Visiting hours will be from 6 to 8 p.m. today at Carpenter Funeral Home, Rockland. A funeral will be held at 10 a.m. Friday at Grace Bible Fellowship, Rockland. The Rev. Peter M. Sheff will officiate. Burial will follow in Fairview Cemetery, Warren.

Abstract: Year by year, bond issue by bond issue, Maine continues to clean its water and air and rid itself of hazardous waste. This November, voters will again get a chance to build on this legacy of investment in a cleaner, safer Maine. Much of the money will improve sewage systems, including Portland's, that still combine storm drainage and sewage lines. When there are heavy rains, the extra water flowing into sewage treatment plants causes them to overflow, sending raw sewage into the environment.

Full text: Year by year, bond issue by bond issue, Maine continues to clean its water and air and rid itself of hazardous waste. This November, voters will again get a chance to build on this legacy of investment in a cleaner, safer Maine.
On the ballot is a $7 million environmental bond deserving of voter support.
The bond includes $3.35 million for building water pollution control facilities. This money will be matched with $10 million in federal funds.
Much of the money will improve sewage systems, including Portland's, that still combine storm drainage and sewage lines. When there are heavy rains, the extra water flowing into sewage treatment plants causes them to overflow, sending raw sewage into the environment.
Other water pollution funds will go into a grant program to help small towns solve sewage disposal problems. Often these relate to in- ground septic systems that are not adequately disposing of waste. Money from the bond will also help smaller communities design centralized sewage treatment systems.
The bond includes $1 million for cleaning up discarded tires. These stockpiles pose a significant environmental risk because of the toxins that would be released should the tires catch fire. Also, tire stockpiles provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes.
Another $1.15 million of the bond proceeds would be spent cleaning up hazardous chemical spills and monitoring sites where chemical spills could become a problem. The bond includes, too, $1.5 million for loans to local water companies trying to meet new federal safe drinking water standards.
Past bond initiatives have helped the state's environment tremendously. Casco Bay, for instance, is far cleaner today than it was 30 years ago . Many areas with previously closed shellfish beds now have open beds.
Mainers should continue this investment in its air, ground and water by approving the $7 million environmental bond on the November ballot

The food matches the view at Ogunquit's Hurricane

Abstract: The menu is as beautiful as the surroundings. Divided into soups and salads ($5 to $14), small plates -- appetizers that can serve as a smaller dinner ($8 to $50) -- and dinner entrees ($15 to $26), there are more than 30 items on the regular menu. A number of specials are offered each day, as well as several vegetarian selections. An excellent wine list, and wine suggestions for entrees, are presented. For an appetizer, I ordered the five onion soup with a flaky golden cheese crust ($6). Spanish and red onions along with shallots, scallions and leeks were combined with chicken stock and light cream to create this mild soup. Served in a crock, the top was covered by a square of puff pastry that was filled with goat cheese. My spoon broke the delicate crust and came up filled with the cheese, onion, pastry trio that was simply delicious. My companion ordered one of the evening's specials, oven-poached Atlantic halibut ($23). This elegant combination featured snowy white fish simmered in a gingered coconut milk broth. It was served with a purple --- almost black --- Thai sticky rice. The dish was topped off with chunks of fresh lobster meat. This was a dramatic entree with flavor and texture to match. The ginger and coconut milk infused the fish and rice, ensuring that not a morsel remained on the plate. Also served was the asparagus and a beautiful garnish of parsley and red pepper.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a freelance writer who lives in Portland.
The business card for Hurricane Restaurant says it all: "Our view will blow you away -- our menu will bring you back."
Nestled in the rocks at Perkins Cove, the Hurricane occupies a quintessential sea coast shanty. Small and compact, the cedar shingled building holds court over a magnificent ocean view. The dining room --- one large room divided in the center by a partial wall -- and the bar, are on the first floor.
The Sunday night I visited, the place was jammed. The small bar was crowded elbow-to-elbow, and people were lined up, some outside the door. Reservations are a must.
The interior of the restaurant is simple. Seafoam green and white woodwork and walls barely contain the large windows that line three sides of the dining room. There are 20 small tables dressed in white linen with votive candles. Each enjoys an ocean view. The excellent waitstaff are polished and professional, turned out impeccably in oyster and white.
The menu is as beautiful as the surroundings. Divided into soups and salads ($5 to $14), small plates -- appetizers that can serve as a smaller dinner ($8 to $50) -- and dinner entrees ($15 to $26), there are more than 30 items on the regular menu. A number of specials are offered each day, as well as several vegetarian selections. An excellent wine list, and wine suggestions for entrees, are presented.
After placing our order, we settled back to enjoy the outrageously good homemade sourdough bread served with olive oil. The bread had an even, chewy texture and a lovely crust.
For an appetizer, I ordered the five onion soup with a flaky golden cheese crust ($6). Spanish and red onions along with shallots, scallions and leeks were combined with chicken stock and light cream to create this mild soup. Served in a crock, the top was covered by a square of puff pastry that was filled with goat cheese. My spoon broke the delicate crust and came up filled with the cheese, onion, pastry trio that was simply delicious.
My companion ordered the Vietnamese beef soup ($6). What a taste treat it was. Carrots, onions, pea pods, bean sprouts, tomatoes, celery, mushrooms and thin strips of beef were combined in a clear soup flavored with a bit of red pepper, basil, lemon grass, garlic and lots of other exotic spices. The colors were dazzling and the flavor addictive. This could have been our dinner.
Other appetizers include lobster gazpacho ($14), roasted tomato and fresh mozzarella salad ($7) savory Atlantic smoked salmon cheesecake ($14), potted duck liver pate ($9) and Royal Caspian Osetra Caviar ($50).
House salads are included with all entrees. A plate of fresh mixed greens arrived, slightly over-dressed. While the buttermilk based peppercorn dressing was excellent, a lighter hand would have better flattered the greens. Also in the salad were sweet onions and a liberally dusting of pistachios.
For an entree, I selected the fire-roasted veal chop ($26). It arrived encrusted with crushed pistachios and served with cast- seared wild mushrooms and a truffled potato pancake. The chop was more than an inch thick, fork tender and done to perfection. Abundant with succulent juices, it was enough to feed two hungry people. The flavorful truffled potato was shaped into a patty and sauteed golden. The chop was presented on top of the potatoes. Also on the plate were excellent sauteed wild mushrooms and fresh asparagus spears.
My companion ordered one of the evening's specials, oven-poached Atlantic halibut ($23). This elegant combination featured snowy white fish simmered in a gingered coconut milk broth. It was served with a purple --- almost black --- Thai sticky rice. The dish was topped off with chunks of fresh lobster meat. This was a dramatic entree with flavor and texture to match. The ginger and coconut milk infused the fish and rice, ensuring that not a morsel remained on the plate. Also served was the asparagus and a beautiful garnish of parsley and red pepper.
Other entrees include chicken breast Saltimbocca ($15), lobster cioppino ($24), galantine of zucchini ($15), and rack of lamb ($22).
Desserts are mouthwatering. The seven offered on the fixed menu include semi-sweet chocolate silk pie with a vanilla bean sauce, lemon mousse with candied lemon peel and blueberry Napoleon. Three additional desserts were on the specials menu. Each is $7.
Selecting only one dessert was a tough choice, but I was more than satisfied with my key lime pie. The silky, tangy-tart filling was poured into a graham cracker crust and topped with fresh whipped cream. The consistency was light as air and heaven on the tongue.
My companion ordered one of the specials, a Pinot Noir poached sekel pear tart. Light pasty cream covered the tart crust with the delicate pear slices fanned out on top. It also was served with whipped cream. The dessert plates were decorated with imaginative and beautiful garnishes made from fruit sauces and fresh fruit.
With food this great, I'd come back no matter what the view. But I'm so glad to get the ocean too. Perhaps heaven is a hurricane?
Our bill before tax and tip and drinks was $75.

Full text: It's a fisherman's paradise that only hits the East Coast once every two years: the Fish Expo.
Hundreds of fishing enthusiasts, both local and international, attended this year's Fish Expo, an industry extravaganza that showcases fishing gadgets, foul-weather gear, and new-fangled nets, boats and fishing technologies.
Besides a virtual fishing game that attracted pie-eyed fishermen, another popular display was the aquaculture pavilion, a complex of booths with information on growing oysters, clams and fish.
Aquaculture in Massachusetts reels in about $10 million a year and is becoming more popular as commercial fisherman struggle with dwindling fishing stocks.
"People look at aquaculture as a means of producing protein and also as an alternative income source since many of the fisheries are declining," said David L. Beutel, a researcher at the University of Rhode Island's aquaculture and fisheries training program.
Chip Johnson, a swordfish and lobster fisherman from Harpswell, Maine, came to the expo to find a trap that would help him catch his own bait.
He said the bait he uses costs about $100 for a 55-gallon barrel. He said the cost has skyrocketed since some fish stock used as bait have declined.
"If I could find a net to catch my own bait, I would be saving a lot of money," he said.
Neil Thompson, a 25-year-old commercial fisherman from Kingston, R.I., went to the Fish Expo to share information about harvesting shellfish. He is waiting to hear whether the Rhode Island state government will approve his application to lease an acre of bay frontage to grow clams and scallops.
"But this is where my passion is. I'm optimistic," said Thompson.
Many fishing novices picked up mock business plans for an aquaculture business or learned about the dangers of the industry, including pollution and friction with some commercial fishermen who are angry about bay leases.

Seafood catch in Maine hits record high And revenue of $273 million nearly ties the best ever, despite the decline in groundfish.

Abstract: The National Marine Fisheries Service reported that a total of 271.3 million pounds of fish, shellfish and other marine creatures were landed in Maine last year, an increase of 4 percent from the record set in 1996. The overall price paid for that catch rose 10 percent to $273.3 million, just shy of the record set in 1995. Massachusetts has the second most valuable statewide catch at $214.8 million. Maine's top money-makers last year were the American lobster, Atlantic salmon, green sea urchin, northern shrimp and softshell clam. The strong overall numbers for 1997 were predictable after NMFS reported earlier this year that landings of lobster had shattered the old records for weight and value. It is the most valuable species in the region and Maine accounts for more than half of all lobster landings. The $138 million lobster catch in 1997 accounts for more than half of the state's revenue.

Full text: Maine's commercial fishing and aquaculture industries set a new record for the weight of their catch in 1997 and nearly tied the record for the most revenue in a single year, according to new federal data.
Despite continuing struggles in groundfish and other fisheries, Maine once again drew on the diversity of species available along its coast and on the strength of its lobster industry to lead 10 Northeastern states in seafood landed and sold.
The National Marine Fisheries Service reported that a total of 271.3 million pounds of fish, shellfish and other marine creatures were landed in Maine last year, an increase of 4 percent from the record set in 1996. The overall price paid for that catch rose 10 percent to $273.3 million, just shy of the record set in 1995. Massachusetts has the second most valuable statewide catch at $214.8 million.
Portland remained the third-ranked fishing port in the Northeast, after New Bedford, Mass., and Pt. Judith, R.I. The fishing industry landed 74.9 million pounds and $43.2 million dollars worth of seafood here in Portland Harbor in 1997.
Maine's top money-makers last year were the American lobster, Atlantic salmon, green sea urchin, northern shrimp and softshell clam. The strong overall numbers for 1997 were predictable after NMFS reported earlier this year that landings of lobster had shattered the old records for weight and value. It is the most valuable species in the region and Maine accounts for more than half of all lobster landings. The $138 million lobster catch in 1997 accounts for more than half of the state's revenue.
"Lobster clearly is the thing that's keeping revenues high," said Teri Frady, spokeswoman for NMFS.
The lobster catch is being watched closely this year, and officials who track the numbers say a slow start, especially in southern Maine, is pointing to a decline in 1998.
Down East Maine's farmed salmon industry, the second most valuable enterprise, recorded a 7 percent increase in revenues in 1997, recouping some of the 18 percent drop the year before.
The overall increases in 1997 did not mean every fishery and every fisherman had a good year. The catches of some important species declined, such as sea scallops and urchins. And, even in the lobster industry, increasing competition made it more difficult for some fishermen to maintain their incomes.
Some traditionally valuable catches remained low on the list. Cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder have been overfished and depleted, hurting coastal economies throughout New England. New England states caught 45.3 million pounds of the groundfish last year, an increase from 1996 but a fraction of the 151.4 pounds caught 20 years ago.
The decline of those fish has forced Maine fishermen to chase other species. The numbers show they've had some success adapting.
Fifty to 60 marine species are harvested along the Maine coast. About 20 of them -- from herring to mussels and marine worms -- each account for more than $1 million in revenue for fishermen. "People have been able to diversify into other things," said Frady.
Along with dominance in the lobster industry, the ability of Maine's commercial fishermen to shift species has kept the state on top in the region. "Maine," said Frady, "has always been a little more diversified."

Abstract: About 12,000 years ago, the residents of a pair of coastal communities in what is now southern Peru were exploiting the ocean for a living - feasting on fish, seabirds and shellfish - in the earliest evidence of maritime-based societies in this hemisphere, according to two studies appearing in today's edition of the journal Science. "It really gives a lot more evidence to the theory that very early migration to America could have taken place along a coastal route by people who were fishers rather than big-game hunters," said David E. Keefer of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. The settlements studied by teams headed by Keefer and Daniel H. Sandweiss of the University of Maine existed slightly earlier than the Clovis Culture of big-game hunters in North America - those ancient folks so often pictured in books, armed with spears and confronting mammoths.

Full text: Many of America's earliest settlers may have been digging clams and netting fish rather than throwing spears at mammoths.
About 12,000 years ago, the residents of a pair of coastal communities in what is now southern Peru were exploiting the ocean for a living - feasting on fish, seabirds and shellfish - in the earliest evidence of maritime-based societies in this hemisphere, according to two studies appearing in today's edition of the journal Science.
"It really gives a lot more evidence to the theory that very early migration to America could have taken place along a coastal route by people who were fishers rather than big-game hunters," said David E. Keefer of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.
"It could change the view of what the earliest Americans were really like," he said in a telephone interview.
The most common theory for the populating of America has been hunters crossing the frozen Bering Strait and moving through the interior of the continent on foot. Some anthropologists have speculated on the possibility of people sailing small boats along the coasts, but until now they have had no solid evidence of such communities.
The settlements studied by teams headed by Keefer and Daniel H. Sandweiss of the University of Maine existed slightly earlier than the Clovis Culture of big-game hunters in North America - those ancient folks so often pictured in books, armed with spears and confronting mammoths.
Sandweiss isn't quite as sure that the new findings prove the theory of a coastal migration route for America's earliest settlers that was separate from the inland route. The residents of the community he studied at Quebrada Jaguay appear to have spent part of the year there and part of their time in the highlands, where they may have been hunters, he said.
What the research does show, Sandweiss said, is that "people were interested in exploiting all different kinds of food sources from almost as soon as they arrived in the Americas. . . . They saw opportunities in potential diet and they went for it. That's something we thought before, but . . . we can prove it now."
For archeologist Betty Meggers at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, the new findings confirm her suspicions. Researchers have long expected to find such sites, she said, but many of them were probably destroyed by rising sea levels over the centuries.
"I think that we're just getting down to a reasonable view of what was going on," said Meggers, who was not part of the research teams. "These people made use of whatever was available."
In the newly studied area of Peru, the sea floor drops off steeply, so when sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age, little land was lost horizontally - leaving remains of communities that existed near the coast.
No remains of boats were found, but the researchers discovered fishing nets and cutting tools and were able to date the settlement from the charcoal left behind.
"The biggest surprise was how overwhelmingly the material was maritime," Keefer said, adding that "99.8 percent of the bones and shells were fish, shellfish and seabirds."
These people were "overwhelmingly specialized for gathering food from the sea," he said.
Keefer's site, called Quebrada Tacahuay, was about a half-mile from the shore and was probably chosen because of available fresh water, he said.
"They saw opportunities in potential diet and they went for it. That's something we thought before, but . . . we can prove it now." Daniel H. Sandweiss, University of Maine

Abstract: Thousands of gallons of raw sewage continued to flow into the Kennebec River from a cracked pipe Tuesday, forcing marine resources officials to maintain a ban on digging in some of the most productive clam flats in the state. But officials in the town of Winslow said they hope to have equipment in place today to begin repairs to the broken pipe, which carries the town's waste under the river to a treatment plant in Waterville. The Department of Environmental Protection said the sewage leaking from the pipe was being highly diluted in the river and should not cause any significant damage to fish or the river.

Full text: Thousands of gallons of raw sewage continued to flow into the Kennebec River from a cracked pipe Tuesday, forcing marine resources officials to maintain a ban on digging in some of the most productive clam flats in the state.
But officials in the town of Winslow said they hope to have equipment in place today to begin repairs to the broken pipe, which carries the town's waste under the river to a treatment plant in Waterville.
To reduce the flow of sewage into the river, the town began diverting the waste into tank trucks and shipping it to Waterville over the highway.
The Department of Environmental Protection said the sewage leaking from the pipe was being highly diluted in the river and should not cause any significant damage to fish or the river.
However, the DEP also said it will likely conduct an inspection of the many other pipes that carry wastewater across or under Maine rivers to prevent similar incidents elsewhere.
Meanwhile, an advisory by the Bureau of Health remains in effect from Vassalboro to Augusta, warning residents not to swim or stand in the water.
In the town of Phippsburg, where clam digging has been halted until further notice, clam diggers urged officials to get the pipe fixed quickly.
"Everybody's pretty put out," said Terry Watson, the owner of Clam Hunter Seafoods.
The 20-inch pipe carries waste from homes and businesses in Winslow under the river to the Kennebec Sanitary Treatment District plant in Waterville.
On Friday, a town employee in Winslow noticed waste bubbling up in the river. Since midday Sunday, divers have been trying to find the leak and repair it.
John Giroux, public works director for the town of Winslow, said Tuesday the divers have uncovered a crack at least 5 feet long in the pipe.
He said a barge with excavation equipment owned by Cianbro, a private heavy-construction contractor, will move in to take over the work today.
Giroux said the pipe, 20 feet under the surface of the river, was initially covered by 3 feet of rocks when it was installed in 1977. It's now buried beneath 7 feet of rocks, tree limbs, silt and other material deposited over the years.
"The divers have been doing a super job, but they just can't get to it under all that debris," he said.
It's not clear how long the pipe may have been leaking, but Giroux said the town inspects the pump station and pipe regularly, so he thinks the problem occurred fairly recently.
"If it had been going on for a long time, the sanitary district would have observed a loss in flow, or some fisherman on the river would have seen it," he said.
The DEP said Winslow officials had estimated that up to 90,000 gallons a day may be leaking from the pipe.
David Courtemanche, a staff member in the DEP's water-quality division, said that equals a flow volume of .14 cubic feet per second. That compares to a flow rate for the river of 3,500 cubic feet per second.
"So there's a lot of dilution there," he said. "There's no threat to the fishery or anything like that."
However, state health officials decided to post an advisory warning people not to have contact with the river above Augusta because untreated sewage can contain dangerous bacteria, viruses or other organisms that can cause disease.
The Department of Marine Resources also imposed a ban on shellfish harvesting after it learned of the spill last Friday. Paul Anderson, the director of the department's public health division, said the ban was a precautionary measure to prevent the possibility of people eating contaminated seafood.
"It's a public health issue," he said.
Department staff took samples in the river as far north as Augusta Tuesday to check for contamination. Anderson said the test results will be available Thursday, and if no contamination is found, the flats might be reopened.
"A lot will depend on the volume of sewage that's escaped into the environment," he said.
While the ban remains in effect, about 60 licensed clam diggers in Phippsburg, Georgetown and West Bath will have to forgo digging in some of the most productive flats on the lower Kennebec.
Jon Hentz, shellfish warden for the towns, said the closure will force diggers to use less productive flats, reducing their clam harvest by at least a third.
"It's a significant impact on their income," he said.
Watson, the clam digger and dealer from Phippsburg, said diggers were frustrated because they were being forced to use flats that they would normally keep in reserve, for digging in the fall when increasing rain forces a shutdown of the more productive flats.
If they dig the reserve flats out now, they will have nothing to fall back on when the fall rains come.
"That's the biggest thing," he said. "Right now, it's not a big impact, but it could be in the long term."
Giroux, the Winslow public works director, said the sewer pipe has broken three times in the past 22 years, but the two previous breaks occurred on shore and were easier to repair.
He said the pipe was supposed to have a 100-year life span but would be replaced next year.
"Our engineers and contractors think we may have gotten a defective product," he said.
At the DEP, Dennis Purington, an engineer who specializes in wastewater treatment, said the state has many sewer pipes crossing rivers. Some are on bridges, and others are buried in the river beds.
He said the only previous breaks he could recall occurred in 1987, when record flooding washed out a pipe on a bridge in Anson and Madison and also caused damage in Skowhegan.
"This is a rare occurrence," he said. "But it may lead us to instigate an inspection program."
Purington said the DEP would have to contact towns to gather information on the location of pipes, what they're made of and when they were installed.
He said he had no idea how many such pipes there are in Maine or what a testing program might cost.

Abstract: A cracked pipe leaking 300,000 gallons of raw sewage a day into the Kennebec River forced the state to close clam flats 50 miles downstream and prompted warnings to keep out of the river. Clam flats in Arrowsic, Georgetown and Phippsburg, which are most directly vulnerable to river pollution, were closed as a health precaution and will likely remain closed at least until late this week, a Marine Resources Department official said. Temporary repairs of the pipe leaking sewage from a quarter-inch crack about 5 feet long will probably take three or four days, Winslow Public Works Director John Giroux said. The crack could be longer, Giroux said.

Full text: A cracked pipe leaking 300,000 gallons of raw sewage a day into the Kennebec River forced the state to close clam flats 50 miles downstream and prompted warnings to keep out of the river.
Clam flats in Arrowsic, Georgetown and Phippsburg, which are most directly vulnerable to river pollution, were closed as a health precaution and will likely remain closed at least until late this week, a Marine Resources Department official said.
Temporary repairs of the pipe leaking sewage from a quarter-inch crack about 5 feet long will probably take three or four days, Winslow Public Works Director John Giroux said. The crack could be longer, Giroux said.
Divers on Monday examined the 16-inch-diameter pipe, which crosses the river from near Route 201 in Winslow to a treatment plant in Waterville. A portion of the main on the riverbed is covered with sand and gravel.
Working from a barge that is to arrive today, repair crews plan to temporarily repair the pipe before deciding how to permanently repair it, said Giroux.
The Department of Environmental Protection earlier estimated that more than 100,000 gallons of raw sewage, about 50,000 gallons a day, had leaked into the Kennebec since Friday, when the break was discovered.
But Giroux said Monday the pipe started leaking more as more of the cracked pipe was exposed. He said the leaking will continue until repairs can be made.
Paul Anderson, director of DMR's public health division, said the department will analyze samples of clams downstream to determine the impact of the pollution flowing from the broken pipe.
State officials advised people to not have contact with the water downstream by wading or launching boats. The threat to shellfish worried local harvesters.
"I am outraged," said James MacLeod, former head of the Brunswick Marine Resource Committee. "This closure of Phippsburg is going to be devastating to shellfish harvesters. It's putting people out of work."
The cause of the break has not been determined, but Giroux speculated that it may have been caused by stress.
The sewage flow through the cracked pipe could not be shut off, Giroux said.
"I am outraged. . . . This closure of Phippsburg is going to be devastating to shellfish harvesters. It's putting people out of work." James MacLeod, former head of Brunswick Marine Resource Committee

Spurwink Country Kitchen: doing it right since 1955

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]13 Sep 1998: 2E.

Abstract: On a recent drive, I discovered a second compelling reason to make a visit that way -- the Spurwink County Kitchen. Established in 1955, the roadside restaurant of diminutive height fits into the surroundings without disturbing them. The restaurant is set back from the road a bit, and a colorful cutting garden near the road beckons diners. Spurwick offers two entree specials each night of the week, and for years they have stayed the same: On Saturday, for instance, it's baked beans with a hot dog or bratwurst, cole slaw, brown bread or roll ($7.50) or beef pot pie ($7.95). On Wednesday, it's chicken pot pie ($7.75) or angel hair pasta with marinara or meat sauce ($7.50). Those prices include a cup of homemade soup, rolls, vegetables and choice of potato or brown rice. I ordered a cup of the lobster stew ($3.25) and grew happier with each spoonful. The cup contained three claws plus other meat, cream, milk, butter and sherry. It was what a good version should be -- light, flavorful and jammed with lobster meat. My companion had a cup of the soup of the day ($2.85) -- lamb curry. Tomato, carrot, onion, potato, celery, dill seed and lamb gave this soup a rich, robust, full-bodied flavor.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
Driving out Spurwink Road toward Scarborough is a visual treat. The expansive salt marshes and blue sky meet to form a serene and inviting landscape.
On a recent drive, I discovered a second compelling reason to make a visit that way -- the Spurwink County Kitchen. Established in 1955, the roadside restaurant of diminutive height fits into the surroundings without disturbing them. The restaurant is set back from the road a bit, and a colorful cutting garden near the road beckons diners.
An enclosed porch runs along part of the front of the long building. Inside are three dining rooms paneled in pine and furnished with simple pine tables and chairs. The decoration is minimal -- prints of boats, a small vase with a single flower on each table, wall sconces for lighting. The view from all the dining rooms is of the salt marsh. This is a place that hasn't changed much since 1955, and the patrons like it that way.
On a midweek night, we waited about 20 minutes for a table. Once seated, we were greeted by a young and efficient server. She knew the food and the most expedient way of delivering it. And there is quite a selection.
Spurwick offers two entree specials each night of the week, and for years they have stayed the same: On Saturday, for instance, it's baked beans with a hot dog or bratwurst, cole slaw, brown bread or roll ($7.50) or beef pot pie ($7.95). On Wednesday, it's chicken pot pie ($7.75) or angel hair pasta with marinara or meat sauce ($7.50). Those prices include a cup of homemade soup, rolls, vegetables and choice of potato or brown rice.
There are other choices too. For appetizers, there are homemade soups ($2.85 cup, $3.95 bowl), clam chowder ($3.25 cup, $4.50 bowl), lobster stew ($5.95 cup, $8.50 bowl), shrimp cocktail ($5.95), and smoked salmon or mussels ($6.95).
The sandwich menu includes kid-friendly choices such as grilled cheese ($2.95/$3.95 with ham) and a 10-inch hot dog ($2.95). Adult selections include lobster and crab meat rolls ($8.75 and $7.75), turkey, club and BLT ($3.95 to $6.25).
There also are salads and salad plates, including Caesar with or without chicken or shrimp ($5.95 to $6.95), a Kinzer Cobb with greens, eggs, blue cheese, artichoke hearts, black olives and bacon ($6.95), lobster salad ($9.95), and fruit salad ($6.95).
Seafood entrees are plentiful -- fried, broiled, grilled or baked stuffed. Haddock, scallops, shrimp, clams and lobster are all available ($15.95 to market price). Other entrees include hot roast turkey or beef ($7.95), black beans and rice served alone or with shrimp or chicken ($7.95 to $9.95), chicken ($11.50) and New York sirloin ($12.95 for 12 ounces). Daily specials include an omelette.
I ordered a cup of the lobster stew ($3.25) and grew happier with each spoonful. The cup contained three claws plus other meat, cream, milk, butter and sherry. It was what a good version should be -- light, flavorful and jammed with lobster meat. My companion had a cup of the soup of the day ($2.85) -- lamb curry. Tomato, carrot, onion, potato, celery, dill seed and lamb gave this soup a rich, robust, full-bodied flavor.
Served at the same time was a bread basket with homemade blueberry bread and dinner rolls. The bread was delicious, but the homemade dinner rolls really were like my grandmother's.
The small salad ($2.85) contained a nice assortment of fresh ingredients -- greens, cucumber slices, grated red cabbage, carrots and tomato. All the dressings are homemade, including a creamy dill and blue cheese. My vinaigrette had a nice zing.
For an entree, I chose one of the day's specials, a fried oyster plate ($11.95). The heaping serving that arrived was enough for four people. The oysters were tender and golden and came with tartar sauce. Also on the plate was my choice of potato salad, a simple, bland version with celery, celery seed and mayonnaise, and the vegetable of the day, canned corn, tomatoes, scallions and green peppers. This medley had been stewing for quite a while -- also similar to grandma's old-fashioned ways -- and was fairly flavorless.
My companion ordered one of the Tuesday specials, meatloaf with gravy ($7.75). A generous slice of meatloaf was topped with gravy. Also on the plate was a large mound of mashed potatoes and the vegetable medley. The meatloaf was topped with ketchup while baking and it had a satisfying taste. The gravy and potatoes were quite salty but still enjoyable.
The dessert menu features homemade pies ($2.75/$3.75 a la mode). When I got my slice of fresh peach, I understood why they're such big sellers. Firm peaches were combined with cinnamon and a little lemon and wrapped in a flaky crust. The resulting pie was tart and delicious.
My companion was equally delighted with the homemade tapioca ($1.95). This dish was creamy and smooth and a joy to ingest. Both desserts were served with real whipped cream. Other desserts include gingerbread, pudding and ice cream.
Our total before tax, tip and drinks was $40.

Full text: Darla Castelli realized a professional dream last week as she assumed the position as interim athletic director at Kennebunk High School.
Castelli replaced Jim Daley, who resigned in mid-August to accept a position at Oyster River High School in Durham, N.H.
"The day Jim Daley resigned, our principal Dr. Dave McConnell asked if I was interested as an interim appointment," Castelli said. "When I came back from vacation, it was a done deal."
Castelli, 31, has taught physical education at Kennebunk for the past six years and has coached field hockey the last four seasons.
A graduate of Plymouth State College in New Hampshire, she earned a Masters Degree at Northern Illinois University. She is one course from earning her certificate in secondary administration.
"I'm excited," Castelli said, as she takes over a position that oversees 22 varsity sports.
"It's not often that you have an opportunity to try a news position before you go for it full time. But this was a natural progression for me career-wise.
A welcome to new coaches in the York County high schools:
At Marshwood, Jason Tanguay takes over the girls soccer program while Gerry Leavitt takes over the boys.
At Noble, Jason Sullivan is the new golf coach and Holly Clark takes over field hockey. Shelly Lajoie, who has been active in the track program, replaces Claudie LaBrie as boys and girls cross country coach. LaBrie, who was head coach for nine seasons, remains as an assistant.
At Sanford, the new soccer coaches are Ray Grogan for the boys and David McCall for the girls. Grogan coached at Traip Academy last year.
At Traip, Steve Freeman adds soccer to his duties as girls basketball coach. Tom Veilleux is the new girls soccer coach. Art Scott adds girls cross country after coaching the boys team for several years. Jessica Crosby is the new field hockey coach.
At Wells, Jay Moore is the school's first golf coach. He also coaches boys basketball.
At Kennebunk, Pat Moody adds varsity golf to his boys basketball duties.
In another change of note, Biddeford football coach Brian Curit has taken a teaching position at the high school after teaching several years at the Kennedy Middle School. This will allow Curit to be in closer contact with his players throughout the year.
Ryan Martin of Traip Academy has been named a member of the Roberto Clemente All-Stars, a national baseball team that will travel to Puerto Rico next winter to face other amateur teams.
Martin's team will include players from across the United States who will meet in San Juan Feb. 14 for a training camp before playing five games over the next four days.
While in Puerto Rico, Martin will meet Vera Clemente, the wife of the late Roberto Clemente who was the inspiration for the program. Clemente is often called the Latin Jackie Robinson because he paved the way for other Latin players to enter Major League Baseball.
Martin will also receive instruction from top coaches and former major leaguers. The games will be played in a 14,000 seat stadium.
Martin must raise the expenses to make the trip. He can be reached at 207-439-1084.
The 30th annual Tri-City Golf Classic will be held Saturday and Sunday at the Biddeford-Saco Country Club, the Dutch Elm Golf Club and the new Dunegrass Country Club at Old Orchard Beach.
The tournament, sponsored by the Saco Bay Rotary Club, will have a field of 180 players competing over 54 holes of medal play.

Clam differs, divers at odds Waldoboro selectmen try to forbid using scuba equipment to take softshell clams.

Abstract: For generations, clammers have earned their living the old- fashioned way: forking through the mud with a rake, hour after back- breaking hour. When a group of scuba divers showed up on the Medomak River recently and began gathering easy and generous bushels of clams in 12 feet of water, traditional diggers worried. "A couple of guys got the genius idea of trying it," said Scott Coffin of Waldoboro. "I've been digging clams for 20 years and I've never heard of it. This is a brand new thing that's just busted open. Now it's like a free-for-all." Alarmed that the divers might be taking clams that reseed the flats, 65 diggers signed a petition last month asking town officials to act. Selectmen complied, issuing an emergency conservation closure that forbids the taking of softshell clams in the river by means of scuba equipment.

Full text: For generations, clammers have earned their living the old- fashioned way: forking through the mud with a rake, hour after back- breaking hour. When a group of scuba divers showed up on the Medomak River recently and began gathering easy and generous bushels of clams in 12 feet of water, traditional diggers worried.
A way of life might be overrun by a trend.
"A couple of guys got the genius idea of trying it," said Scott Coffin of Waldoboro. "I've been digging clams for 20 years and I've never heard of it. This is a brand new thing that's just busted open. Now it's like a free-for-all."
Clams are taken seriously in Waldoboro. With 200 commercial diggers, there are more here than in any other town in the state. Last year, 730,000 pounds of clams were harvested, at a value of $1 million.
Alarmed that the divers might be taking clams that reseed the flats, 65 diggers signed a petition last month asking town officials to act. Selectmen complied, issuing an emergency conservation closure that forbids the taking of softshell clams in the river by means of scuba equipment.
But there's a glitch. Town authority extends only to the low-tide area and the divers seem to be reaping their harvest in areas always covered by water.
"I'm puzzled by the town's action," said Lt. Dan Morris of the Maine Marine Patrol, the enforcement arm of the state Department of Marine Resources. "How can they call it conservation when they allow 100 clammers on a flat but not one diver? Other than pleasing local clamming constituents, the order has no effect."
Local communities see it differently.
"At high tide the divers will be going into the intertidal zone as well, and there's no way to monitor it," said Scott Tilton, chairman of the George's River Shellfish Committee, a group that oversees a single shellfish ordinance for five towns north of Waldoboro."If clams are taken at both low and high tide, it's hard on the resource."
Last Wednesday, George's River enacted a closure order similar to Waldoboro's.
The situation is opening up well-established policies to new questions, said Rene Cloutier, marine patrol officer for the Medomak and Georges rivers. "People are starting to question the ordinances," he said.
As long as clams are harvested by hand, no state laws have been broken. "Any area open for the taking of shellfish can be harvested by diving," noted Marine Patrol Sgt. Ron Dolliver.
Tension between the two groups of clammers is escalating. Coffin claims two divers tried to drive his 17-year-old son off the road while he was collecting petition signatures. Clammers say they chase divers out of the area whenever they can.
"It's quite a mess," said Waldoboro diver Abden Simmons, 27, who used to clam with Coffin. "The town's got it so everybody's thinking it's against the law, but it isn't. I've got the right to do it. It all depends on how many guys give me a hard time."
Clams start life as microscopic larvae, drifting with the currents. After two months, they change shape and descend to the bottom, still smaller than a grain of sand. They settle everywhere, from mudflats to 15 miles offshore, according to state clam expert Brian Beal, at the University of Maine at Machias.
There are subtidal populations of softshell clams along the entire coast of Maine, according to Beal. Divers have gone after them in Cutler and Jonesport.
Living underwater with a constant flow of nutrients, those clams tend to be larger than those exposed at low tide. Some reach 4 inches, more than double the average clam size. No one knows how abundant they are, or what role they play in reseeding the stock.
The Waldoboro divers hit a bonanza. One of them told a Marine Patrol officer that he picked 20 bushels in five hours of diving. The average take is 2 1/2 bushels per tide, with a hoe. The current price per bushel, $70 to $90, is a healthy incentive, but that will drop after Labor Day.
State officials see the venture as short term.
"If this had long-term profit there'd be a heck of a lot more people doing it, but they're not," said watershed administrator Hal Winters. "That's the key."
On Tuesday, an extreme low tide, called a drainage tide, will lower midcoast rivers 1.3 feet more than usual, exposing many acres of mudflats normally underwater. Clammers licensed to dig in Waldoboro say they plan to harvest clams in the St. Georges River at Thomaston, found below the mean tide mark.
"If the divers are going to clean out our river, we have no choice," Coffin said.
Should they try it, warned Tilton, they will be stopped by a warden and cited, and be forced to pay a fine or go to court.

Full text: Maybe it was a typo.
Some people who received a recent letter from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maine, telling them their managed-care insurance rates will rise 48.5 percent, thought it was a mistake.
It's not.
The 3,000 or so Maine residents with individual policies are suffering from health-insurance sticker shock. A single adult under age 40 with a standard policy will now pay around $265 a month for coverage.
Both Blue Cross and Maine's Bureau of Insurance say the rate increase can't be helped. The policy is losing money, paying out more in care than it's taking in from premiums.
"I'm the first to say 48 percent is a big increase," said Al Iuppa, the state's insurance superintendent. "Granting the increase isn't something I relish doing."
Other carriers have also raised rates for individual coverage. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care put in for a 25 percent increase a few months ago, for a plan that covers 450 people in Maine. Now standard family coverage costs around $630 a month.
"We had the lowest premium in the market at the time," said Bob Downs, Harvard's development director in Maine.
The rise in individual rates is the most visible part of an ongoing trend toward higher health-insurance premiums. It's a barometer, in a sense, of the rising cost of health care. And it could reopen the debate over how to make health insurance more affordable in Maine.
"Individual plans tend to be purchased by people who use their health services," said Carol Morris, a Blue Cross spokeswoman. "So it's a good reflection of the actual cost of medical services."
Most people in Maine receive health-insurance coverage through their employers. These group plans tend to have lower rates, because claims expenses are spread across a larger pool of people. Individual coverage tends to be bought by people who are out of work or are self-employed. That's a relatively small number, and rates tend to be higher.
By law, carriers have to offer individual coverage to anyone who can pay the premiums. Blue Cross, a non-profit company that lost $47 million last year, has the most individual policies in Maine.
The Blue Cross plan generating the 48.5 percent hike is called Individual HMO, a 3-year-old managed-care plan. It experienced a modest rate increase last year, around 6 percent. But mounting claims, Blue Cross said, have been traced this year to a higher use of prescription drugs, as well as hospital and doctor treatment.
Morris said that the plan has been paying out $1.50 in claims for every dollar of so it takes in from premiums. A 48.5 percent hike, she said, was the minimum the company could ask for.
"There's no profit built into this increase," she said.
That does little to calm customers.
Tony Seccareccio owns the Oyster Shell Motel in Damariscotta. He has a family policy to cover himself, his wife and a daughter. A diabetic, he has recently been hospitalized.
Seccareccio said he was angry when he got his letter late last month, saying his coverage would jump on Oct. 1.
"I was at my wit's end," he said. "Forty-eight percent. That's ridiculous."
Seccareccio was paying $700 a month for his coverage. With the increase, he was facing premiums of $1,135 a month. So he started calling around and found an individual policy with Tufts Health Plan that costs around $750 a month.
Seccareccio is discouraged that he has to pay so much for health insurance. He blames the government for being distracted by issues that don't affect average citizens.
"They're in Washington worrying about if this guy has got his pants up or down," he said, referring to Congress and President Clinton. "We've got our problems here."
In Augusta, Iuppa said that by law the state must approve rates unless they are inadequate, discriminatory or excessive. While the Blue Cross increase is high, he said, it's not excessive because it's barely meeting costs.
The frustration felt by individual policy-holders may extend next year to other subscribers. Health-care costs have been rising. Financially battered by years of cutting prices to meet competition, insurers have begun raising premiums across the board.
At Harvard, Downs said he expects the industry to seek premium increases next year ranging from 8 percent to 20 percent. He expects Harvard's overall rates to rise 10 percent or so.
Those increases could make insurance too expensive for many people, renewing debate over how to control rising costs.
In the early 1990s, Congress and Maine lawmakers decided government would have only a limited role in providing health insurance. In Maine, roughly 150,000 people don't have health insurance, either because they choose not to have coverage or they can't afford it.
"What's the role of government and how do we deal with the uninsured population?" Downs said. "I don't think you're going to find the marketplace stepping up to solve the uninsured problem. So the debate may come back again, as we see premiums increasing."
That debate would be welcomed by Joe Ditre, director of Consumers for Affordable Health Care.
Ditre contends that the economies promised by managed care have pretty much run their course. As rates begin to rise again, he said, it's time to reconsider the merits of some form of universal health care.
"Policy makers," he said, "are going to have to think long and hard about the next step."

Abstract: About 6 million seed clams whose total value could grow to $500,000 were stolen from an aquaculture nursery, the company's owner says. Lori Howell, who runs the Spinney Creek Shellfish nursery, wonders if someone wanting to sabotage a controversial breeding project is to blame. The tiny clams were stolen between Aug. 5 and Aug. 14 from the Eliot-based business, said Howell, who runs the operation with her husband, Tom.

Full text:   About 6 million seed clams whose total value could grow to $500,000 were stolen from an aquaculture nursery, the company's owner says.
Lori Howell, who runs the Spinney Creek Shellfish nursery, wonders if someone wanting to sabotage a controversial breeding project is to blame.
The tiny clams were stolen between Aug. 5 and Aug. 14 from the Eliot-based business, said Howell, who runs the operation with her husband, Tom.
As seed, or juveniles, the clams are worth more than $15,000, but Howell said they can yield 8,000 bushels of full-sized clams worth about $500,000 when fully developed.
The Sagadahoc County Sheriff's Department and state Marine Patrol are investigating.
Spinney Creek Shellfish is awaiting state approval of a 35-acre aquaculture bed in the Upper Lake of the New Meadows River, where the Howells want to establish a site to breed Maine's classic softshell clam and American oysters.
But many West Bath and Brunswick harvesters of clams and quahogs spoke against the project during a Department of Marine Resources public hearing last May.
Local diggers said Spinney Creek and another aquaculture business that wants to locate beds in Upper Lake would reap the rewards of the local towns' efforts to clean up the New Meadows River.
After being closed for more than 30 years, Upper Lake was recently ruled clean enough for harvesting.
"But we're basically sickened at the general level of fear or jealousy, or whatever it is, associated with this clam bed," Howell said. "It could have been a very positive thing for the clam harvest in this area."
Spinney Creek's application for the project has not been withdrawn.

Abstract: Nori, the seaweed used to wrap sushi rolls, could be another cash crop for Connecticut if a proposal by the University of Connecticut and the Mohegan Indians comes to fruition. The university's Avery Point campus and the tribe have received preliminary approval for a $296,000 grant to study genetic manipulation of nori so that it flourishes in local waters. "We are optimistic that this is going to go forward," said Richard Cooper, director of the Marine Sciences and Technology Center at Avery Point. "We know that the program is a good solid program that has some very strong opportunities in terms of stimulating our marine economy here."

Full text: Nori, the seaweed used to wrap sushi rolls, could be another cash crop for Connecticut if a proposal by the University of Connecticut and the Mohegan Indians comes to fruition.
The university's Avery Point campus and the tribe have received preliminary approval for a $296,000 grant to study genetic manipulation of nori so that it flourishes in local waters.
Eventually, UConn and the tribe hope to start a nori farm and sell the seaweed.
"We are optimistic that this is going to go forward," said Richard Cooper, director of the Marine Sciences and Technology Center at Avery Point. "We know that the program is a good solid program that has some very strong opportunities in terms of stimulating our marine economy here."
The state Bond Commission still must approve the grant from Connecticut Innovations Inc., a quasi-public agency that sponsors inventors and developing businesses.
And that depends on the willingness of Eastport, Maine-based Phycogen Inc., which grows nori in Maine, to start a commercial farm in Connecticut.
Ike Levine, the president and chief executive of Phycogen, said he is seriously considering relocating his entire company and its 50 employees to southeastern Connecticut, because he believes the waters may be more hospitable to nori farming.
But first, the company must find a suitable site that would not pose a hazard for boaters. Two sites are under consideration: in the Thames River off the coast of the Mohegans' reservation or near Avery Point where the tribe has leased shellfish beds from the state.
The nori is grown on floating, lattice-like structures attached to nets. The plants could foul propellers or rudders if the farm is too close to boating areas.
But the timing of the growing season may also reduce the impact to boaters. In Maine, most of the nori farming occurs between September and December.
"The plants are darker and deeper and richer in color when there is less sun so that would be your autumn and your spring vs. your summer," Levine said.

CLEANER WATER MEANS FLATS OPEN MANY LONG-CLOSED CLAM FLATS ARE REOPENING TO DIGGERS, THANKS TO WATER-QUALITY REGULATIONS.

Abstract: Clam digging has returned to Dromore Bay on the Kennebec River for the first since the late 1940s. And the digging on the 300-acre flat is good. Prices are, too. Clams are fetching $85 a bushel, with diggers hauling in an average of three bushels each tide. The Dromore Bay flats were reopened recently by the state Department of Marine Resources. The seasonal opening will run from May 15 through Sept. 30. "It's a significant step because Dromore Bay is the last piece of the pie for Phippsburg," said John D. Libby, one of Phippsburg's 40 commercial clam diggers. "Dromore was an area we were told would never open."

Full text:   They are a sight that has not been seen in 50 years on Dromore Bay: bodies bent over the mud at low tide, raking and clawing as though they were searching for gold.
Clam digging has returned to Dromore Bay on the Kennebec River for the first since the late 1940s. And the digging on the 300-acre flat is good. Prices are, too. Clams are fetching $85 a bushel, with diggers hauling in an average of three bushels each tide.
The Dromore Bay flats were reopened recently by the state Department of Marine Resources. The seasonal opening will run from May 15 through Sept. 30.
"It's a significant step because Dromore Bay is the last piece of the pie for Phippsburg," said John D. Libby, one of Phippsburg's 40 commercial clam diggers. "Dromore was an area we were told would never open."
The trend is heartening. Dromore Bay is one of four clam flats in the midcoast area which have opened, or are expected to open, by the end of this year.
State experts attribute the openings to better water quality brought on by stringent, even controversial, federal regulations. Those regulations, for example, caused the city of Bath to commit to a $6 million project upgrading its wastewater-treatment plant, a move that is expected to further reduce storm runoff and is cited as an example in helping downriver clam flats.
The state also explains that a corps of 80 volunteers from Kittery to the Canadian border has become active in testing water quality, which also has led to flat reopenings. The state has six, paid field employees who conduct water testing statewide.
Since 1995, some 50,000 acres of clam flats have been reopened across Maine, according to Paul Anderson, director of the State Department of Marine Resource's public health division.
He credits a rising environmental awareness among the public.
"People are starting to care about what happens in their backyard," Anderson said.
Anderson said another flat, Brighams Cove in West Bath, could reopen this fall thanks to the efforts of Bath Iron Works, private landowners and harvesters, who have cooperated to remove seven overboard discharge systems.
The benefits could be great there as well: Brighams Cove includes 350 acres of flats believed to be rich in mussels, softshell clams, oysters and quahogs. Brighams Cove was closed to digging in 1978.
Clam digging returned to the town of Arrowsic last month. After being closed for more than 30 years, the state gave the town permission July 21 to start harvesting clams from 250 acres of clam flats along the Kennebec and Back rivers.
In late June, the state authorized commercial clam digging at the northern end of Harpswell Sound. About 100 acres, which had been closed as long as 10 years, have been reopened.
Cindy Moody, Harpwell's assistant code officer, tested the flats for five years before the state would agree to reopen the area.
"I worked real hard to get these flats opened," Moody said. "It's a good feeling to know that the waters are clean enough for digging and swimming."
Richard Lemont, chairman of Phippsburg's Shellfish Conservation Commission, spent hours upon hours of his own free time taking water quality tests for the state.
Libby, the Phippsburg commercial clam digger, credits Lemont with getting Dromore Bay reopened.
"There is nobody who has done as much work as that guy has," Libby said.
Phippsburg diggers now have access to nearly every piece of available clam flat on the Kennebec River, from Atkins Bay and Wyman Bay near the mouth of the river to Dromore Bay at the north end of town.
"In 1976, clam digging was not a viable living," Libby said. "Now I can dig clams year-round."
Anderson of the Department of Marine Resources said preliminary tests have shown that pollution levels in the Kennebec River increase during winter months when upriver wastewater treatment plants in such towns as Richmond, Gardiner and Augusta stop chlorinating their wastewater.
That may be another area where regulations can bring about more improvement. Although more tests need to be done, Anderson said the state may require plants to chlorinate year-round so that areas like Dromore Bay can be opened longer.
"We're working with the DEP (Department of Environmental Protection) to turn this from speculation to science," Anderson added.
AT A GLANCE
Since 1995, some 50,000 acres of clam flats have been reopened across Maine, according to a state official.

SEBAGO BREWING COMPANY: THE FOOD'S AS GOOD AS THE BEER

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]06 Aug 1998: 13D.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/276876895?accountid=10457

Abstract: The newcomer, a spacious eatery and ale house, is attractive, comfortable and functional with upscale modern tables and booths, and is decorated with framed charts and topographical maps of the Sebago Lake region. A separate, full-scale bar area offers three large- screen TVs and plenty of table and bar seating. Upon entering, one is treated to a view of some of the beer-making apparatus. Sebago is the theme, reflected in the ales' names - Frye's Leap, Lake Trout Stout, Boathouse Brown and Northern Light. We tried the Frye's Leap and Boathouse Brown ($3.50 each). The Leap was a light, refreshing India pale ale, and the Brown was full-bodied and sweet.

Sebago Brewing Company
150 Philbrook Ave., South Portland
879-2537
Food: good to very good
Service: very good
Value for money: good to very good
Hours: 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. daily
Price range: $2.95 up
Credit cards: yes
Wheelchair access: yes
Smoking section: yes
Bar: yes, open until 12:30 a.m.
The bottom line: Another restaurant/brewhouse has hit the greater
Portland scene.
The former brewmaster at the Sea Dog in Camden has opened Sebago Brewing Company in the same building that once housed the Huki Lau restaurant and, more recently, Crickets.
The newcomer, a spacious eatery and ale house, is attractive, comfortable and functional with upscale modern tables and booths, and is decorated with framed charts and topographical maps of the Sebago Lake region. A separate, full-scale bar area offers three large- screen TVs and plenty of table and bar seating.
Upon entering, one is treated to a view of some of the beer-making apparatus. Sebago is the theme, reflected in the ales' names - Frye's Leap, Lake Trout Stout, Boathouse Brown and Northern Light. We tried the Frye's Leap and Boathouse Brown ($3.50 each). The Leap was a light, refreshing India pale ale, and the Brown was full-bodied and sweet.
Sebago Brewing offers a full menu that includes an oyster, clam and shrimp bar. Entrees featuring fish, beef and chicken are priced from $10.95 to $13.95. All come with bread, vegetables and choice of rice or potatoes. Hearty pasta dishes run from $7.95 up. Sandwiches are all priced at $6.75 except for the lobster roll, which is $8.95. Burgers with cheese, bacon and mushroom are $6.25 There's a meadow burger for $5.95 and substantial-sounding salads for $5.95 and up.
We opted for the grilled rosemary chicken sandwich and the grilled tuna steak sandwich. Both came with fries and five-star sour pickle spears. Both meats were grilled perfectly and were served on freshly baked sesame-seed rolls. The chicken was garnished with ripe tomato slices, roasted zucchini and fresh rosemary. The tuna came with lettuce, tomato, red onion and aioli dressing.
These left us filled and satisfied with no room for lemonberry tort ($3.95) or French Chocolate Chambord Cake ($4.25). Perhaps next time.

Abstract: My appetizer, pan-seared foie gras with a Vidalia onion and a gold raisin compote was served with a port wine sauce and fresh field greens ($11). The foie gras was exceptional. It was so flavorful, so full of delicious fat, it was like eating cream. The texture was sublime and the accompanying combination of the onion, raisins and port made this a memorable dish. Also served on the plate was a medley of fresh field greens. The bittersweetness of them was the perfect foil for the rich liver. This could have been my dinner. My entree selection was the sauteed Maine lobster with local wild mushrooms in a whiskey and herb beurre blanc with roast potato spears (market price/$31.95 that evening). An entire lobster shell -- tail and body -- had been cleaned out, lined with spinach leaves and filled with a mixture of lobster meat and minced mushrooms tossed in a sauce of beurre blanc (an emulsified butter sauce made from shallots and herbs) and whiskey. It was divine. The lobster was sweet, tender and plentiful, the mushrooms delicate and flavorful and the sauce delicious. Also on the plate were four spears of white potato, pan-sauteed to slightly golden. They were a simple accompaniment to an otherwise rich dish. My companion ordered the flash-seared tournedos with glazed pearl onions, white bean and roast garlic puree and gaufrette potatoes ($24.95). The presentation of this dish was dramatic. The white bean puree was in the center of the plate. Surrounding it were the three tournados interspersed with tiny caramelized pearl onions and small rounds of pared zucchini. Standing on end in the puree were the gaufrette -- three crisp, golden, latticed potato waffles. The white puree was smooth and redolent with garlic, the tournados were tender and delicious, the onions were pearls of pleasure and the gaufrette were a rare French treat. All in all this dish was outstanding.

In the dining room at the Cape Arundel Inn, you feel as if you're floating over an azure sea.
The inn was originally constructed as a summer residence in 1895 and sits atop a hill offering magnificent views of the ocean, the lighthouse on Goat Island and the Isle of Shoals. It's been under the ownership of Jack Nahil since 1997.
The dining room is a sky box surrounded by windows that open out, catching the sea breezes. The interior is simple -- white paint, white linen, light-hued wood chairs, small table lamps and wall sconces all with white shades. Injected into this pale landscape is an intense splash of color -- cobalt blue water goblets. Other cobalt glass objets d'art are arranged in groupings in the room. The overall effect is tranquil and sophisticated.
Reservations are recommended at the inn. I made mine almost a week in advance and still was not seated next to a window, as I had requested. Fortunately, every seat comes with a great view.
The night I visited, the reservation list was close to full. An overflow of would-be diners sipped drinks on the porch, waiting for a table. The clientele included guests of the inn and many summer visitors. It was an older, sedate, well-mannered crowd.
While enjoying the view, we scanned the menu. It included eight first plates -- appetizers ($5.95 to $11), three salads ($4.50 to $7.95) and nine "Maine" courses ($19 to $25.95, plus market-priced lobster). Several specials are offered each evening.
Executive chef Rich Lemoine's inventive menu is complemented by a choice wine list. Full bar service is available, though there is no bar or lounge.
After ordering, we sampled the homemade black olive bread. Pastry chef Steve Harmon's version of this earthy-flavored bread had a beautiful texture and appearance along with an impressive taste. It proved a good warm-up for what was to come.
My appetizer, pan-seared foie gras with a Vidalia onion and a gold raisin compote was served with a port wine sauce and fresh field greens ($11). The foie gras was exceptional. It was so flavorful, so full of delicious fat, it was like eating cream. The texture was sublime and the accompanying combination of the onion, raisins and port made this a memorable dish. Also served on the plate was a medley of fresh field greens. The bittersweetness of them was the perfect foil for the rich liver. This could have been my dinner.
My companion ordered the evening's soup selection, a Thai- inspired lobster bisque ($6.95). This rendition contained seared savoy cabbage, lobster, chive, lemon grass, cream and hot red pepper. The soup had a rich red-to-brown color, a smooth base and a spicy bite.
Other appetizers included Napoleon of smoked salmon and asparagus ($9.95), broiled oysters in a hazelnut crust with herbal couscous ($8.95) and a sampler of ginger poached shrimp, Maine crab filled spring roll and tea-smoked sirloin with wasabi citrus remoulade ($9.50).
We shared a Point Arundel salad ($4.50). This combination of select baby lettuces with shiitake mushrooms and pink peppercorns was dressed with a whisper-light lemon and extra virgin olive oil vinaigrette. Topping the lettuce were flash-fried onions. The freshness of the ingredients and simplicity of the salad made it one of my all-time favorites. Other choices were grilled romaine hearts with red-peppered bleu cheese and wild Maine blueberry dressing ($6.95) and baby spinach salad with purple Alphonso olives, prosciutto, feta and oyster mushrooms in a citrus-mint vinaigrette ($7.95).
My entree selection was the sauteed Maine lobster with local wild mushrooms in a whiskey and herb beurre blanc with roast potato spears (market price/$31.95 that evening). An entire lobster shell -- tail and body -- had been cleaned out, lined with spinach leaves and filled with a mixture of lobster meat and minced mushrooms tossed in a sauce of beurre blanc (an emulsified butter sauce made from shallots and herbs) and whiskey. It was divine. The lobster was sweet, tender and plentiful, the mushrooms delicate and flavorful and the sauce delicious. Also on the plate were four spears of white potato, pan-sauteed to slightly golden. They were a simple accompaniment to an otherwise rich dish.
My companion ordered the flash-seared tournedos with glazed pearl onions, white bean and roast garlic puree and gaufrette potatoes ($24.95). The presentation of this dish was dramatic. The white bean puree was in the center of the plate. Surrounding it were the three tournados interspersed with tiny caramelized pearl onions and small rounds of pared zucchini. Standing on end in the puree were the gaufrette -- three crisp, golden, latticed potato waffles. The white puree was smooth and redolent with garlic, the tournados were tender and delicious, the onions were pearls of pleasure and the gaufrette were a rare French treat. All in all this dish was outstanding.
Other entree offerings include braised codfish and black mussels in a rosemary Provencal and marinated crispy-fried calamari ($21.95), vegetarian sampler of cavatelli pasta with wilted greens, grilled summer vegetables vinaigrette and mushroom romaine bundles in a chardonnay vegetable broth ($19), and plum wine-marinated grilled duck breast with confit dumplings, green tea rice and sesame honey demiglaze ($22.95).
Dessert choices were just as exotic and enticing as the rest of the fare. I chose the evening's special, a fresh bing cherry tart with homemade cinnamon ice cream ($7.50). I asked for a substitution of vanilla ice cream, was told there was none, and then was told they were out of cinnamon and would be substituting vanilla. The crust of the tart was delicious but the cherries were not plentiful or flavorful enough to make a taste impact. This dessert needed a bigger infusion of flavor.
My companion ordered the lavender honey ice cream and warm strawberries with espresso ladyfingers ($7.50). This dish was sensational. The homemade lavender honey ice cream was subtle in flavor and decadent in consistency. The fresh, warm strawberries sensuously melted into the ice cream. The espresso ladyfingers were light as air. The presentation of both these desserts on oversized plates with decorations of sauces and powdered sugar was lovely.
Other dessert choices include a lemon tart with candied whole almonds, little presents of Tahitian vanilla genoise layered with chocolate ganache, and individual toasted coconut cakes with crispy caramel sheets. All desserts are $7.50 each.
One disappointing aspect of the experience was our server. He wasn't engaging, and while the service was adequate, it lacked a comfort level that could have enhanced the outstanding meal.
Our bill before tax, tip and drinks was $94.
Dining at the Cape Arundel Inn is the next best thing to actually being out in the ocean on a boat. The food and view are both highly recommended.

SAILING'S `JURASSIC PARK' KEEPS ALIVE GOLDEN AGE TEN HISTORIC SCHOONERS OFFER MAINE VSITORS SOME UNFORGETTABLE WINDJAMMING DAYS AT SEA.

Abstract: "It wouldn't be a windjammer cruise without a lobster feed on the beach, with all you can eat," says Capt. Dan Pease of the schooner Lewis R. French, which was launched in 1871 to haul fish, coal, lime and bricks and is the oldest windjammer in America. "Imagine, eating your fill of lobster!" The 10 ships in the Maine Windjammer Association, which hail from the picture postcard ports of Rockland, Rockport and Camden, make up the oldest and largest fleet of commercial sailing vessels in the country. Many of them have been designated National Historic Landmarks. "On God's great blue ocean, nowhere else can you see on any given summer day as many historic sailing ships operating as they did 100 years ago on Penobscot Bay," says Paul DeGaeta, one of the two captains of the three-masted Victory Chimes, the largest passenger schooner in America. "We are the Jurassic Park of the Golden Age of Sail."

Full text: At this captain's table you'll see nary a tux and there's no need to fret over which fork to use.
Come chow time on a windjammer cruise, dinner is often served on one of the uninhabited, spruce-clad islands off the rocky coast of Maine.
Lobsters, mussels and clams harvestedthat day are steamed in a large cauldron over a driftwood fire, layered with new potatoes and corn on the cob, and piled on a bed of dark-green seaweed.
"It wouldn't be a windjammer cruise without a lobster feed on the beach, with all you can eat," says Capt. Dan Pease of the schooner Lewis R. French, which was launched in 1871 to haul fish, coal, lime and bricks and is the oldest windjammer in America. "Imagine, eating your fill of lobster!"
"It'll be rounded off with homemade, hand-cranked ice cream," adds Capt. Gib Philbrick of the schooner Nathaniel Bowditch.
These days Pease and Philbrick and more than a dozen other skippers of historic schooners are busy. From Memorial Day until Columbus Day they will be taking passengers on scenic cruises through the 3,000 islands off the coast of Maine, as well as taking them back in time.
The 10 ships in the Maine Windjammer Association, which hail from the picture postcard ports of Rockland, Rockport and Camden, make up the oldest and largest fleet of commercial sailing vessels in the country. Many of them have been designated National Historic Landmarks.
There is also a loose association of three traditional schooners - the American Eagle, the Heritage and the Isaac H. Evans - that dock at Rockland's North End Shipyard, which specializes in the repair, restoration and construction of wooden vessels.
In addition, there are a few independent operators, such as the schooner Flying Fish, which takes only six passengers, and some offering day trips only.
"On God's great blue ocean, nowhere else can you see on any given summer day as many historic sailing ships operating as they did 100 years ago on Penobscot Bay," says Paul DeGaeta, one of the two captains of the three-masted Victory Chimes, the largest passenger schooner in America. "We are the Jurassic Park of the Golden Age of Sail."
The 132-foot Victory Chimes, built in 1900 in Bethel, Del., as a "ram" schooner to haul lumber up and down Chesapeake Bay, was on its last legs in the 1980s. It was about to be sold to a Japanese group when DeGaeta and his partner, Kip Files, the other captain, stepped in and bought the ship.
Ken and and Ellen Barnes are captains of the Stephen Taber, which was built in 1871 in Glen Head, N.Y., the same year as the launching of the French, and is the oldest sailing vessel "in continuous service" in the United States.
"Our people become involved with hoisting and furling sails, tacking and sail handling, heaving out the anchor, as well as that all-time favorite - swabbing the decks," Ken Barnes says. "This participation is by way of figuring into the permanent history of the vessel.
"When you step aboard and feel the deck beneath your feet and smell the tar and hemp and the wood smoke from the galley, well, mister, you are part of her history whether you want to be or not. She's got you."
Sleeping quarters on windjammers, for the most part, are cramped, often with stacked bunk beds. These are cargo ships that have been converted to passenger vessels.
"Yes, cabins on a traditional sailing vessel are small - I prefer to say they are cozy - and there are very often some wide eyes when some of the guests first see their cabins," says Philbrick, a native of Rangeley, Maine, and a former basketball coach at the University of Maine. "However, after the first night and a brisk sail the first day out, most everyone sleeps like a baby.
"We explain to potential guests before they sign on that if they are looking for a cruise liner, then this probably isn't the vacation they're looking for.
"Windjamming is a little like camping on the water and I think most guests will quickly tell you that the few inconveniences are certainly offset by the whole experience."
One who will tell you that is June Knowles of Belmont, Mass., who last summer boarded the Victory Chimes for her 50th windjammer cruise.
"I love the sea and she (Victory Chimes) has such a sense of history and freedom that I feel when I'm aboard - she's almost alive she's so real," Knowles says.
DeGaeta says several of his former passengers have been on more than 30 cruises and about a dozen have sailed more than 20 times.
The cost of a windjammer cruise ranges from $345 to $745 per person for trips of three to seven days, or roughly $90-$100 a day, including all meals. The 10 vessels in the association carry between 20 and 40 passengers and four to 10 crew members.
Most skippers have no set itinerary as they sail among the scenic islands, dropping anchor for the night at some peaceful harbor or deserted island where passengers can go ashore and explore.
"As far as ports of call are concerned, we try to avoid any large town, favoring the small, charming fishing villages such as Stonington on Deer Isle or Isle au Haute Village, nestled between Kimble Island and Isle au Haute," says Ken Barnes of the Stephen Taber.
"Port Clyde, Matinicus, Tenants Harbor. Burnt Coat Harbor out on Swans Island is a favorite. Many times there is no village, just a peaceful cove haunted by the call of a loon or the snorting of seals on a half-tide ledge."
Barnes' wife, Ellen, who recently published a cookbook, "A Taste of the Taber," oversees the galley where all the meals are cooked on a vintage wood stove, often with the help of passengers.
Breakfast might be Maine blueberry pancakes with bacon. Lunch, served on deck, usually consists of homemade soup or chowder, hot rolls and salad. Dinner in the lamp-lit galley might feature a roast, freshly caught seafood or perhaps a traditional New England boiled dinner. Rounding out the meal are fresh vegetables with herbs from the Barnes' garden and an old-fashioned dessert such as strawberry-rhubarb pie topped with hand-churned ice cream or Indian pudding with hard sauce.
In such a setting, shipboard romances can blossom.
Dan Pease, 39, met his wife, Kathy, when she came aboard the French as a passenger 10 years ago. Now she's in charge of the office and booking passengers.
"We're a team and I can't imagine how I did this without her," Pease says.

Abstract: Central Maine Power Co. customers apparently set a record for power usage late Wednesday as high temperatures baked southern Maine. Temperatures in Portland hovered in the low 90s much of the afternoon and peaked at 92 degrees at 2:50 p.m. - falling just two degrees shy of the record for July 22, set in 1994. Brunswick was roasting, logging in as one of the state's hottest spots at 94 degrees. Augusta, Sanford and Fryeburg were locked in a dead heat for second place at 93 degrees. Caribou was a balmy 87 degrees and coastal Eastport was the coolest locale at 78 degrees - still 20 degrees warmer than the peak of Mount Washington in New Hampshire.

Full text: Central Maine Power Co. customers apparently set a record for power usage late Wednesday as high temperatures baked southern Maine.
Temperatures in Portland hovered in the low 90s much of the afternoon and peaked at 92 degrees at 2:50 p.m. - falling just two degrees shy of the record for July 22, set in 1994.
Brunswick was roasting, logging in as one of the state's hottest spots at 94 degrees. Augusta, Sanford and Fryeburg were locked in a dead heat for second place at 93 degrees. Caribou was a balmy 87 degrees and coastal Eastport was the coolest locale at 78 degrees - still 20 degrees warmer than the peak of Mount Washington in New Hampshire.
"It's amazing what a constant onshore breeze will do," said Eric Scwibs, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
With the mercury rising, temperatures were high enough for customers to crank up their air conditioners - and use a lot of power.
Mark Ishkanian, spokesman for Central Maine Power Co., said power demand throughout New England soared to 21,420 megawatts at 4 p.m., breaking the previous New England-wide record of 20,580 megawatts set last year.
In Maine, the demand in CMP's region hit 1,340 megawatts shortly before 5 p.m., apparently breaking the old record of 1,337 megawatts. The number, however, is preliminary and may be adjusted upward or downward, Ishkanian said.
"It was obviously a high load day for Maine and New England," Ishkanian said. "The good news is, we had enough supply to meet the demand."
CMP and other New England power companies declared Wednesday a "conservation day" based on predictions by the Environmental Protection Agency calling for high ozone levels in the air. To curb pollution and power use, the EPA and CMP asked people and businesses to limit their use of automobiles and electricity.
The Maine Mall, for instance, turned off about 10 percent of its lights and shut off four of its 33 air-conditioning units, said Bruce Soper, the mall's assistant general manager.
While the heat came as expected, dangerous ozone levels did not. Ozone levels were rated "good" for southern Maine throughout the day Wednesday, and "moderate" for the midcoast and at Acadia National Park. As of 5 p.m., they had yet to reach the federal standard for unhealthy levels.
David Conroy of the EPA said ozone levels remained acceptable because the winds blew from the west for most of the day, instead of from the southwest as had been predicted.
At Aquaboggan Waterslide in Saco, business was booming as heat-weary swimmers lined up early to cool off on the water rides. "We haven't had lines like this in years," said operations manager Ramona Lodge.
"There have been crowds of people playing soccer outside the gates two hours before opening time," said Mark Prohaska, operations director of Water Country in Portsmouth, N.H. "Today there were cars of families out here at 7:30."
Circuit City in South Portland had been sold out of air conditioners for the second time this season until a fresh shipment of 400 arrived before Tuesday's heat.
Most people coming into the store were not picky - they just wanted relief, said manager Matthew Hill, who said he wondered in June if warm weather would ever arrive.
"The summer started off, it never got hot in Maine. We wondered if we were going to sell any air conditioners at all. Then the heat kicked in," he said. "It's been a robust couple of weeks."
Steve Broumas of the weather service said coastal regions should reach the upper 70s to mid-80s today, with interior sections hitting the mid-80s, and the humidity should not be as oppressive. ____________________________________________________________________ _____

Abstract: Andy Bertocci slows the boat and steers through the moorings off Peaks Island. He approaches a green sailboat as the owner climbs into a punt and starts rowing toward shore. The sailboat owner is a new customer, and as he and Bertocci shout pleasantries through the Casco Bay breeze, Bertocci asks the man if he's ready to have the sloop's waste tank pumped out. Bertocci collects the sewage so boaters don't dump their wastes into the bay. Bertocci, with a backgroundthat includes firefighting, dairy farming, seaweed processing and boat repairing, operates Maine's only dedicated pumpout boat - Baykeeper II - for the Friends of Casco Bay. He travels the bay, ties up to moored and docked boats, clamps a hose to their waste tanks, and then yanks the starter cord on a pump that sucks the contents into a 300-gallon tank inside the hull of his 21-foot center-console boat.

Full text: Andy Bertocci slows the boat and steers through the moorings off Peaks Island. He approaches a green sailboat as the owner climbs into a punt and starts rowing toward shore.
The sailboat owner is a new customer, and as he and Bertocci shout pleasantries through the Casco Bay breeze, Bertocci asks the man if he's ready to have the sloop's waste tank pumped out. Bertocci collects the sewage so boaters don't dump their wastes into the bay.
"Are you coming around Friday?" the man asks. "There's only about five gallons now. Come back Friday and I'll probably have four more for you."
It might be more than Bertocci needed to know, but he welcomes the indelicate details and gladly accommodates the man. After all, every gallon counts.
Bertocci, with a backgroundthat includes firefighting, dairy farming, seaweed processing and boat repairing, operates Maine's only dedicated pumpout boat - Baykeeper II - for the Friends of Casco Bay. He travels the bay, ties up to moored and docked boats, clamps a hose to their waste tanks, and then yanks the starter cord on a pump that sucks the contents into a 300-gallon tank inside the hull of his 21-foot center-console boat.
It's not as dirty a job as you might think, and the occasional odor is quickly whisked away in the breeze. And Bertocci, 45, can't get enough business.
"I feel like I'm making a difference," he said, "one gallon at a time."
Sewage dumped from boats spreads disease-carrying microorganisms, steals oxygen from aquatic life and can make eating shellfish and swimming unsafe.
It's illegal to dump sewage overboard within three miles of shore. It's also pretty common.
There are several thousand boats in the bay. Bertocci has a list of about 130 customers, and pumpout stations at scattered marinas don't see many more.
Boaters may think their contribution is insignificant because of the thousands of gallons of untreated sewage that overflow municipal sewers into the bay after rainstorms. Not Bertocci. "These 15 gallons are still important," he said as he hooked the pump up to a cabin cruiser at Spring Point Marina.
The pumpout boat diverted 4,000 gallons from being dumped overboard last summer, but that's not the only reason for the effort. Giving boaters a convenient way to do the rightthing also fosters a broader understanding of the environment and a stronger commitment to the bay, he said.
Friends of Casco Bay has been operating the boat each summer since 1995, partly through a federal grant program that could end next year. This is clearly not a fund-raiser. Bertocci may go miles across the bay for 15 gallons of waste, and he collects just $5 for every pumpout.
But even more than funding, Bertocci wants more customers. Ultimately, he'd like to make the service so popular thatevery marina offers it and no one ever calls him. "We'd love to put ourselves out of business," he said.
The demand has increased steadily, but Maine boaters still traditionally flush right into the ocean. Boaters cruising the Maine coast from away are a regular source of customers because they come from harbors with pump-
outs at every marina.
"There's absolutely no reason it shouldn't be exactly the same here," Bertocci said. In the meantime, he's more than happy to help out.
For a list of pumpout locations along the coast, call the Maine Coastal Program at 287-1486. Call 776-0136 (or hail Baykeeper II on Ch. 9) to set up a visit by Bertocci.

Abstract: Laudholm Farm, a historic saltwater farm dating back to 1720, is the site of the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve. It encompasses 1,600 acres of fields, a forest, wetlands and a beach. This is the place where a variety of wildlife, endangered species and wildflowers are protected. The original buildings have been accurately preserved but now, instead of housing people, the many rooms are home to researchers, educators and planners of visitors programs.

Laudholm Farm, a historic saltwater farm dating back to 1720, is the site of the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve. It encompasses 1,600 acres of fields, a forest, wetlands and a beach. This is the place where a variety of wildlife, endangered species and wildflowers are protected. The original buildings have been accurately preserved but now, instead of housing people, the many rooms are home to researchers, educators and planners of visitors programs.
More than 50 visiting and resident scientists are here each year doing research focusing on the Gulf of Maine. The rise of the sea level, beach erosion, the quality of coastal habitat and its restoration for finfish, shellfish and all wildlife is the major concern of these scientists. What makes this program so special is that it includes and needs volunteers of all ages to work along with these highly trained people. It is a collaboration that has resulted in many significant research findings.
For all of you who love to eat clams, you may have had one or two from the flats in Wells. You had them because of the work done by the Water Evaluation Team of volunteers who monitored the water quality in the reserve's estuaries. Their efforts provided the driving force that resulted in the opening of 800 acres of clam flats in Wells for the first time in 10 years.
The reserve's education efforts and programs seek to inform the public and policy makers about the importance of the wetlands and the necessity of protecting them. One program is the estuarine ecology curriculum, which teaches the intricacies of the relationship between living organisms and the environment.
Seven miles of trails at the reserve take visitors through fields, onto a tidal river, through a forest, to the ocean. At the visitor center is a gift shop, abundant information about the reserve and a video presentation.
All of this is made possible by the many volunteers who give their time by conducting tours, assisting the researchers, working on fund- raising, working at the visitor center and helping administration. There is no time limit to what a volunteer can do here. Enthusiasm is high among the volunteers, and there are more than 400 people involved in the reserve.
Call the Wells Reserve at 646-1555 for more information.

Abstract: The mud in Brighams Cove hasn't been raked by a commercial clam digger in 20 years, but this fall a technological innovation is expected to unlock the door to an area that was once rich in softshell clams, mussels, oysters and quahogs. The wastewater systems, commonly called overboard discharge systems, are among the 1,965 such systems licensed by the state. In 1987, Maine banned construction of the systems, which treat wastewater only with chlorine. Although the systems at Brighams Cove are legal, their mere presence means that the Department of Marine Resources must follow Maine law and keep the cove closed to clamming.

Full text: The mud in Brighams Cove hasn't been raked by a commercial clam digger in 20 years, but this fall a technological innovation is expected to unlock the door to an area that was once rich in softshell clams, mussels, oysters and quahogs.
The 350-acre cove has been closed to shellfish harvesting since 1978 because seven privately owned wastewater discharge systems empty water from sinks, showers and toilets into its waters.
The wastewater systems, commonly called overboard discharge systems, are among the 1,965 such systems licensed by the state. In 1987, Maine banned construction of the systems, which treat wastewater only with chlorine.
Although the systems at Brighams Cove are legal, their mere presence means that the Department of Marine Resources must follow Maine law and keep the cove closed to clamming.
For years, West Bath has tried unsuccessfully to get rid of the seven wastewater systems. But replacing the systems became more important after Bath Iron Works won approval recently for a multi-million-dollar expansion.
That project could pollute the only remaining clam beds from which West Bath and Phippsburg still make money.
BIW offered the services of environmental engineer Phil DeLeon because it wanted to be a good neighbor. Then BIW and the two towns formed a task force to tackle the project.
Their task was daunting: Convince property owners to help pay to replace their wastewater systems and find suitable treatment systems to take their place that could be installed on rocky, undersized lots.
"It was something that a few years ago seemed impossible to do," West Bath Selectman Ronald Beal said. "We could have forced something down their throats, but landowners have rights, too. A lot of negotiations went on to make everyone happy."
To defray the landowners' costs, the task force successfully solicited funding from local banks, the Casco Bay Estuary Project and will receive $30,000 from the state Department of Environmental Protection. In return for financial help, landowners agreed to have their systems replaced.
"If the property owners pay anything at all, it will be a very small amount," Beal said.
That left the task force with the problem of designing systems that would fit on the cove's tiny lots. Previous consultants, who had surveyed the rocky sites, were not optimistic.
Enter a fledgling environmental company based in Gray. SeptiTech read about the towns' problem in a newspaper article, contacted the task force, and eventually received permission from the state to install two of its patent-pending waste disposal units at Brighams Cove.
One system went in last month and the second is scheduled to be installed in two weeks. SeptiTech president Jim Gray said the units, which he compared to a miniature municipal sewage treatment plant, remove all biological waste before pumping it into a leach field, about a quarter of the standard size.
"We're taking all of the organic matter out of the waste and almost all the nitrates," Gray said. "It essentially renders the wastewater clear."
If the project, which has been licensed on an experimental basis for one year, proves successful, the SeptiTech technology could have an impact on other coastal areas of Maine where overboard discharge systems continue to operate.
Unless a shoreline survey, which is currently being conducted by the state, turns up other sources of pollution - such as an illegal straight pipe discharge with no treatment - DeLeon expects Brighams Cove will be reopened in September.

Abstract: Between a four-hour parade and a huge fireworks display there will be foot races, marble contests, hoop races, and historical talks on shipbuilding and what Main Street was like in the 1850s. "We're putting on family events from that period of time," said one of the event's organizers, Fire Chief William Brewer, whose own Damariscotta ancestors go back to 1820. "This is an opportunity for the younger generation to see what has happened in their area in the last 150 years." Many of the events will take place in the field behind Round Top Center for the Arts, where an encampment by Company A, 3rd Maine Voluteer Infantry has been set up - complete with hospital, musket demonstrations, and a drum and fife corp. Along the water, there will be two tours of the prehistoric oyster shell heaps. There also will be garden tours, and historical house tours, as well as booths, crafts, and food.

Full text: The bunting is up and flags are flying. Starting today, this town will celebrate its 150th anniversary with four days of revelry.
Between a four-hour parade and a huge fireworks display there will be foot races, marble contests, hoop races, and historical talks on shipbuilding and what Main Street was like in the 1850s.
"We're putting on family events from that period of time," said one of the event's organizers, Fire Chief William Brewer, whose own Damariscotta ancestors go back to 1820. "This is an opportunity for the younger generation to see what has happened in their area in the last 150 years."
As many as 30,000 people are expected to attend the event honoring the Lincoln County community that was settled in 1640, and incorporated two centuries later when it broke away from Nobleboro and Bristol.
Many of the events will take place in the field behind Round Top Center for the Arts, where an encampment by Company A, 3rd Maine Voluteer Infantry has been set up - complete with hospital, musket demonstrations, and a drum and fife corp. Along the water, there will be two tours of the prehistoric oyster shell heaps. There also will be garden tours, and historical house tours, as well as booths, crafts, and food.
"We picked the slogan `Bridge to the Future' because back in history, Maine Street was called "the bridge" by residents of Newcastle," Brewer said.
The first real bridge spanned the channel between the two towns in 1797. Bridgekeepers charged foot travelers 3 cents, and a horse and rider 8 cents.
The festival kicks off with a beard-growing contest among some 20 men, ages 18 to 70-plus, who have been growing their beards since January.
On Friday, weather permitting, fireworks will go off over the waterfront.
The parade, on Saturday, will include floats depicting old-time businesses, such as a printing shop. People will be dressed as fire hydrants on the Great Salt Bay Sanitary District's water division float. The sanitary division will advertise itself with a wheelbarrow and shovel, cleaning up behind oxen and horses.
Many families will have their own floats, to show off their heritage.
On the Brewer family float, representing six generations, will be Joan Brewer, in period costume. In 1946, she came from England to Damariscotta as a war bride.
"Damariscotta was a very quiet little town, then," she recalled. "It was much prettier, with tall elm trees along Main Street, and a little five-and-dime. I came from Surrey, where there was quite a lot going on, and the first year it was hard to adjust. But I've been very happy here." HIGHLIGHTS
Wednesday, July 8, 6 p.m. - Judging of the beard-growing contest, at the YMCA
Thursday, July 9, 7 p.m. - Opening ceremony, field behind Round Top Center for the Arts
Friday, July 10, 9 p.m. - Fireworks at the parking area on the waterfront
Saturday, July 11, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. - Parade down Main Street
8 p.m. to 11 p.m. - Street dance
Sunday, July 12, 11 a.m. - Handtub parade and firemen's muster, from Great Salt Bay Community School to the new fire station
2 p.m. to 4 p.m. - Canoe and hike to the oyster shell heaps, starting at the Alewives Stream in Damariscotta Mills. Bring your own canoe.

Abstract: Eric Peters on Tuesday couldn't seem to allay local concerns about his proposed aquaculture venture in Quahog Bay. Peters, of Searsmont, hopes to lease 7.5 acres of water north of Snow Island from the state Department of Marine Resources in order to cultivate and harvest American oysters and quahogs. The lease would last for 10 years; it would take three years just for the shellfish to reach maturity. Peters said repeatedly on Tuesday that that is not his plan. But residents seemed unwilling to believe him, even after the state hearing officer said Peters' promises could be written into the lease agreement.

Full text: Eric Peters on Tuesday couldn't seem to allay local concerns about his proposed aquaculture venture in Quahog Bay.
Peters, of Searsmont, hopes to lease 7.5 acres of water north of Snow Island from the state Department of Marine Resources in order to cultivate and harvest American oysters and quahogs. The lease would last for 10 years; it would take three years just for the shellfish to reach maturity.
Tuesday's public hearing, attended by about 50 residents, was required under the state's application process. The state must make a decision on the lease within 120 days.
Local fishermen and lobstermen initially feared that Peters would seek exclusive use of the waters, and that his operation automatically would shut them out of an increasingly productive fishery and keep pleasure-boaters out of a popular anchorage.
Peters said repeatedly on Tuesday that that is not his plan. But residents seemed unwilling to believe him, even after the state hearing officer said Peters' promises could be written into the lease agreement.
Under the lease, Peters would be allowed only to seed the ocean floor directly, and not contain the shellfish in any trays or other structures sometimes used in aquaculture. Those structures would be damaged by lobster traps and boat anchors.
Peters said he could foresee no problem with lobster traps and anchors landing directly on his oysters. He even said he was willing to reduce the size of his leased area to five acres.
He could not change his mind on any of these conditions once they are written into the lease unless he came back to the state, which would initiate another public hearing process. And if he violates the lease and its conditions, the state can terminate the contract, said Assistant Attorney General Thomas Harnett.
"I feel the lease would eventually benefit the town," Peters told the residents. "It would introduce more shellfish into the area, which will spawn and repopulate the area. Eventually, I'll need to hire people to help me out."
Andrew Pennell, a local lobsterman, said boats are required to stay 100 feet away from a diver. If Peters were diving for oysters, he asked, how could he drop his lobster traps there?
Peters said he would be willing to work with the lobstermen, possibly coordinate his diving times around the fishermen's schedules.
"What will you do if you come in to dive and there are 30 yachts anchored there?" asked Armand Bouchard, a resident of Tondreau Point, which overlooks the bay.
"I probably won't dive that day," Peters said.
"Then don't expect to dive much in July and August," Bouchard said.
The one concern Peters did not address was the issue of water quality. Several residents questioned whether his digging in the silty ocean floor would muddy the bay, which is popular as a swimming area because of its unusually high temperatures in late summer.

Full text: Shrouded by heavy mist, scientist Brian Beal peered out from under his baseball cap and surveyed the clam flats from behind his rain-splattered eyeglasses.
Beal, an associate professor of marine biology at the University of Maine in Machias, and other scientists and local volunteers Tuesday stocked 40,000 baby clams in four spots in the Webhannet River Estuary. The program, an effort of the Wells NationalEstuarine Research Reserve, is intended to boost the clam population for recreational diggers, and perhaps one day for commercial diggers.
Over the last few decades the estuary - once teeming with tasty soft-shell clams - has suffered a decline in population. The theories for the clams' demise are many:
Creatures such as the green crab, virtually unheard of on Maine's coast before the 1950s, feed on the clams, as do ribbon worms. Ice can destroy young clams that haven't burrowed deeply enough into the silt; and, Bob Pirozok of the town's Clam Commission says, it is possible that construction of a jetty has filled the once-deep harbor with sand and altered the flow of tidal water.
No one cause is clear.
"It has all the drama of a murder mystery," Beal said. "I look out there and in that water is so much death and destruction. It's fascinating."
But Pirozok remembers the old days when clams were plentiful.
"We had deep layers of clams several feet thick," said Pirozok. "People used to think of us as the clam capital of Maine."
In the estuary there is an average of 30 bushels of clams per acre, while 50 bushels is considered healthy. And of 150 acres of clam flats in the estuary, only 80 acres are open for seasonal digging, said Michele Dionne, research director at the Wells reserve.
The clams Beal brought to Wells are from a shellfish hatchery. The clams - the size of corn kernels - were scattered like seeds Tuesday and tucked into the muck with protective netting to keep predators away.
Dionne said the town and Wells Reserve are spending $10,000 over two years to seed the flats. More seeding is scheduled for next year. "We had deep layers of clams several feet thick. people used to think of us as the clam capital of Maine." Bob Pirozok, Clam Commission member

Scientists and volunteers on Tuesday scattered 40,000 baby clams the size of corn kernels in four places in the Webhanet River Estuary. The clams were then tucked into the muck with protective netting.

Abstract: Southern Maine's clam diggers went back to work over the weekend after polluted stormwaters forced a 12-day shellfishing ban and created an early summer shortage of the popular shellfish. "It's good to be back at work because we don't get nothing when we're shut down," Ron Willette said Monday afternoon as he unloaded several 25-pound bags of clams from his small motorboat behind the Pine Point Fisherman's Co-Op. "As soon as we get 'em, they're going out," said Kenneth Jacques, who works at the family-owned Clam Shack in Kennebunk. The soft-shell clams were selling fast at $2.99 a pound, or about 20 cents a clam.

Full text: Southern Maine's clam diggers went back to work over the weekend after polluted stormwaters forced a 12-day shellfishing ban and created an early summer shortage of the popular shellfish.
"It's good to be back at work because we don't get nothing when we're shut down," Ron Willette said Monday afternoon as he unloaded several 25-pound bags of clams from his small motorboat behind the Pine Point Fisherman's Co-Op.
Willette got about $1.50 a pound from a dealer, who could sell them at nearly twice that price to customers who are as happy as Willette to see the steamers again.
Diggers were allowed back on the flats Friday and seafood markets throughout the area sold clamsquickly Monday, sometimes at peak prices not usually seen so early in the summer.
"As soon as we get 'em, they're going out," said Kenneth Jacques, who works at the family-owned Clam Shack in Kennebunk. The soft-shell clams were selling fast at $2.99 a pound, or about 20 cents a clam.
The dry spell for clam diggers and clam eaters started with the heavy rains June 13 and 14. As much as 8 inches of rain fell over that weekend in some places in Maine.
On June 14, the Maine Department of Marine Resources issued a shellfishing ban from Kittery to Port Clyde. Other East Coast states also were flooded in the storm and shellfishing eventually was banned all the way to Maryland.
States close shellfish beds after heavy rains because runoff from the storms carries pollutants into coastal waters. The biggest problem comes when runoff spills into sewers and then mixes with raw sewage and overflows sewage-treatment plants and collection systems.
The bacteria, which can make people sick, get into theflesh of clams and mussels as the shellfish filter their food out of the contaminated water.
After announcing a closure, state officials test for bacteria to see when the water and clams are again clean. Because clams flush out the bacteria as they filter clean water again, they do not remain contaminated.
"All the work that we do and all the hours of testing is all about proving what we do harvest and what is on the plates is safe," said Paul Anderson of the Department of Marine Resources.
The closure that ended Friday was particularly prolonged because rains and flooding continued so long. A more typical closure in April lasted four days.
"For us to be out two weeks - you don't expect that," said Ron Willette's brother Bob, one of the men who dig in the Scarborough River mudflats year-round.
Not only did this closure last longer, it came just as summer demand and prices were beginning to climb.
Because clams can only be stored in refrigerators for about a week, the Northeast quickly had a shortage. Clams were brought down from Canada and Down East Maine where there was no flooding, but many markets and restaurants quickly ran out.
"Everybody was just scrambling to get whatever they could," said Michael Thurlow, owner of the Clambake Restaurant in Scarborough.
Although virtually every seafood market contacted Monday had clams for sale, the shutdown has created late-summer conditions in the market: limited supplies and high prices.
And southern Maine dealers and restaurants were trying to build up their supply to avoid running out this holiday weekend. "Everybody's starting with empty coolers now," Thurlow said.
Dealers from Massachusetts, where there are still some closed areas, are adding to the demand for Maine clams.
Those who wanted steamers on Monday paid prices as high as they typically pay in August. Prices heading into July 4 are usually close to $2 a pound and climb to between $2.50 per pound and $3 per pound during the peak of summer demand. Several outlets were asking $2.99 a pound on Monday. SAMPLING OF CLAM PRICES
Here are retail prices for a pound of soft-shell clams at various seafood markets Monday. Supplies are tight and prices are high for this time of year because rains this month forced a 12-day pollution closure of clamflats from Maine to Maryland.
Commercial diggers are now getting paid between $70 and $90 a bushel - or $1.40 to $1.80 per pound. There are 12 to 15 clams in a pound.
Lord's Wells Beach Lobster Pound, Wells Beach: $4
Clam Shack, Kennebunk: $2.99
Twin City Seafood, Biddeford: $2.29
Pine Point Fisherman's Co-Op, Scarborough: $2.99
Bayley's Lobster Pound, Scarborough: $2.99
Harbor Fish Market, Portland: $2.59
Tiny's Bigman Seafood, Portland: $2.69
Day's Crabmeat & Lobster in Yarmouth: $2.59

Abstract: Local fishmongers are searching far and wide for clams this summer after pollution from record rains in the past two weeks closed shellfish beds from Maryland to Maine.

Full text: Planning a clambake on the Fourth of July? You may want to wait before melting the butter.
Local fishmongers are searching far and wide for clams this summer after pollution from record rains in the past two weeks closed shellfish beds from Maryland to Maine.
"I'm trying to source clams everywhere," Kevin Barry, vice president of the Pier Fish Co. in Boston told the Boston Herald. "Things are awfully tight right now."
Most of the clam beds on Cape Cod are open again, but most beds from the North Shore to Cohasset are still closed.
That means more money for fewer clams.
A bushel of steamers was going for $97 this week, Barry said. The usual price is about $20 less than that.
At Woodman's, a clam shack in Essex, the usual fare of Ipswich clams has been replaced by the Canadian variety.
"It's all this rain," said Tracy Swett of Woodman's marketing and sales office. "But we're managing."
She said Canadian clams usually have more gravel and sand than local ones.
"You've got to do a lot of cleaning out," she said.
Ken Coons, executive director of the New England Fisheries Development Association, said Independence Day revelers probably won't go clamless because tons of the shellfish were being shipped to the Bay State from Maryland.
"Everything should be fine," he said, adding, "Assuming we don't get another deluge."
That's a pretty big assumption.
Several shellfish beds in Quincy and Hingham Harbor reopened on Thursday, only to be shut down right away when thunderstorms once again sent polluted runoff into the harvesting grounds.
Only nine of 58 shellfish beds in Buzzards Bay remain open. In Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York, scores of beds also are closed. Maine reopened most of its shellfish beds Friday.
"Before (Friday) we had high hopes of getting lots of areas opened up on the North Shore," said Mike Hickey, chief biologist for shellfish at the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries.
The timing couldn't be worse for clam-diggers, Hickey said.
"This is prime time - two weeks before the Fourth," he said. "From an economic standpoint, this is practically a worst-case scenario."

Full text: By Muriel L. Hendrix
Perhaps you've had the notion it might be fun to put together a do-it-yourself clambake.
Should you:
Pick up a clam rake and bucket and take the family down to that cove where you saw some clammers digging the day before?
Buy a lobster trap and bait and sink the trap outside your cottage?
Pick a few of those hundreds of mussels you saw when you were walking by the shore?
Maybe get a crab trap, too?
Well, hold on a minute. It's not as simple as all that.
In fact, just going out to dig your own clams, not to mention trapping lobsters and crabs, can be absurdly complicated.
Mussels are the only creatures you can take without going through a knotty maze of bureaucracy. But before you pick them, you have to protect your health by checking up on pollution and red tide.
These are some of the knotty little problems you'll encounter. In some localities, like Portland, clams are not regulated locally; state regulations apply. But in others, like Scarborough, local regulations must be followed. In a few areas, several towns have banded together to form a regional conservation district with regulations that govern clamming.
Fifty-seven towns manage their own flats, and four of these do not issue noncommercial licenses. Town fees for clamming are used for shellfish management, conservation, and enforcement of regulations.
Towns that have their own regulations charge different fees for residents and nonresidents, and they have their own peculiar definitions of these terms. In Phippsburg, a resident includes people who are camping at Hermit Island Campground or staying at a bed and breakfast inn in the town. In Scarborough, residents are defined solely as property owners.
One town will allow you to take one peck a day, another, two. In one, you can pick up your permit any time after the first of the month, and only one is issued for each day; another allows you to pick up the permit any time after the first of April and it is good for one year.
REGULATIONS REGARDING the hours people may clam differ according to municipal rules. Some towns have declared clamming at night or on Sunday illegal.
Brunswick has set aside a certain area solely for noncommercial clamming; other towns allow clamming wherever it is legal. Statewide, there is a 2-inch minimum limit, with a 10 percent tolerance.
Here is a sampling of regulations governing noncommercial clamming:
In all towns, you have to find out about flats that have been closed due to pollution, red tide or for conservation measures. Up-to-date red tide information is available on the Red Tide Hot Line; information about pollution can be obtained from the Department of Marine Resources or town halls or marine wardens. This information may change daily. It is best to find out ahead of the day you wish to go clamming what numbers you can call to get reliable information.
If no town has jurisdiction over the flats, the state regulations say you may take no more than a half bushel (two pecks) of soft-shell clams in one day. No license is required.
Scarborough offers 10 resident and five nonresident recreational licenses each day. Residents pay $5, nonresidents $10. Residents are defined as those who pay property taxes to the town. Both residents and nonresidents are allowed one peck a day. Licenses can be purchased up to five days ahead of the clamming date, but only one day's license may be purchased at a time.
Most flats in Portland are closed due to pollution. If you can find one that is open, state regulations apply.
Cumberland, which has jurisdiction over Chebeague Island, issues one nonresident license per day during the summer months. The cost is $5. Licenses are issued for each day of the month beginning on the first day of the month. Residents, defined as year-round residents and taxpayers, may buy recreational licenses for the whole year for $15, an entire month for $10, or one day for $5. All are limited to one peck of clams from one tide a day.
Brunswick property owners or renters may purchase a license for $15 that may be used by any family member in the household for one year. The license is free to residents over age 62, but may be used only by them. The licensing year begins the first Monday in April, and the number of resident licenses is not limited. Other people (including those in B&Bs and from other towns) may purchase a nonresident license good for one day. It may be purchased ahead of time for $5. Nonresidents must clam only in flats set aside for them. Residents and nonresidents are limited to one peck per tide per person.
Harpswell issues noncommercial licenses only to property owners. The cost is $5, and the clamming limit is two pecks a tide.
Phippsburg does not issue nonresident licenses. Residents include people renting a home, apartment or cottage, and campers and guests of residents. (Certain restrictions apply and should be checked before you go to the town office for a permit.) Phippsburg's $10 license fee is waived for seniors (age 65 and over) and age 16 and under. The license is good for the person's term of residency up to one year, beginning April 1. One peck of clams is allowed per day.
Boothbay Harbor belongs to a conservation district that also includes Newcastle, Boothbay, West Boothbay, Damariscotta and Edgecomb. Residents (renters and taxpayers) of these towns must purchase a license in the town they live in; nonresidents may go to any of the six town halls. A resident license for one year, beginning June 1, costs $4; nonresident licenses, good for one day and renewable three times, are $7. Both allow one peck per day.
St. George, Thomaston, South Thomaston, Warren and Cushing are part of a regional district. Taxpayers and people who have rented for two years are considered residents. A recreational resident license for one year costs $15, is free to people under age 12 and over age 65. Nonresidents can buy single-day licenses for $10 each. They are allowed to buy for more than one day at a time. All recreational clammers may take one peck a day.
MERCIFULLY, regulations governing recreational licenses for lobsters and crabs are simpler. State regulations govern the entire coast. But there the simplicity ends, for you have to send away to the Department of Marine Resources or go to a town office for the form (not all towns have them), fill it out and send it and the $46 fee backto Marine Resources for a noncommercial license.
The license allows you to set out any combination of five lobster and crab traps. Write to the Department of Marine Resources, 21 State House Station, Augusta, Maine 04333, or stop buy the office on Winthrop Street in Hallowell.
Mussels also are regulated by the state, but no license is required. You are limited to two bushels of mussels a day for personal use. But be sure you look into red tide and areas closed due to pollution.
Keith Bishop, who is shellfish warden and also a fireman in York (where flats are closed this year due to pollution), has one final caution for vacationers who are not accustomed to eating saltwater fish.
"I've seen a lot of people who've had a violent reaction to a steady diet of seafood," he says. "It seems that the iodine content may be the cause. They're usually people from the Midwest who are used to freshwater fish.
"And another thing, warn people not to eat the tamale (the green stuff in a lobster's bodycavity). It contains toxins that can be harmful."
If you're still up for that do-it-yourself clambake, plan ahead. It'll take some doing, but once you get the knack of what's required wherever you are, it'll be a cinch.

And it varies from town to town, making the task even more difficult. File photo If you want to have a do-it-yourself clambake, you can do it. But it takes a lot of time, effort and license fees, so make sure you're doing it for the fun and experience of it.

ARROWSIC TO REOPEN CLAM FLATS THE VAST ACREAGE OF FLATS HAD BEEN CLOSED TO DIGGING FOR MORE THAN THREE DECADES DUE TO POLLUTION.

Abstract: More than 500 acres of clam flats along the Kennebec and Back rivers will be open to clam digging for the first time in more than 30 years, and town officials will regulate the digging. Town Meeting adopted the ordinance Thursday night, which gives the town's Shellfish Committee the authority to regulate the digging on the newly opened clam flats. Pollution shut down the clam flats for more than three decades, but water quality there has improved enough over the years for the state Department of Marine Resources to reopen them. The clamflats stretch from Squirrel Point Lighthouse and Bald Head on the Kennebec to New Town Creek on the Back River.

Full text: More than 500 acres of clam flats along the Kennebec and Back rivers will be open to clam digging for the first time in more than 30 years, and town officials will regulate the digging.
Town Meeting adopted the ordinance Thursday night, which gives the town's Shellfish Committee the authority to regulate the digging on the newly opened clam flats.
Pollution shut down the clam flats for more than three decades, but water quality there has improved enough over the years for the state Department of Marine Resources to reopen them. The clamflats stretch from Squirrel Point Lighthouse and Bald Head on the Kennebec to New Town Creek on the Back River.
State officials have said that the town could authorize the reopening of those flats as soon as July 1. Without a local shellfish ordinance in place, the state's decision could have exposed the flats to uncontrolled harvesting.
"Other towns would have cleaned us out if we didn't have an ordinance to regulate digging," said Lawrence Wilson, chairman of Arrowsic's Shellfish Committee.
The ordinance, which was unanimously approved, will give the Shellfish Committee the authority to limit the number of shellfish harvesters, place restrictions on the time and location of digging, and set limits on the amounts of clams that can be harvested daily.
It also establishes license fees of $100 for a resident commercial digger and $200 for a non-resident commercial digger. Recreational licenses for residents are $10; for non-residents licenses are $20. There will be a limit on the number of recreational licenses.
Voters also gave the committee $600, funds that will be used to hire a shellfish warden.
"These flats, because they've been closed for so long, could have incredible amounts of shellfish in them," Wilson added.
Donald Card, a regional biologist for the state, said the Department of Marine Resources felt compelled to reopen the flats because of a department policy that requires the state to obtain maximum productivity from all clam flats. Recent samples taken by volunteers from Arrowsic and by state biologists have shown that water quality in the Arrowsic flats is clean enough to allow digging.
"When I was a boy growing up in Bath, I used to go down to the (Kennebec) riverbank to play or fish. It was like a sewer back then," said Card, who has been with the department for 27 years.
In other business, Town Meeting elected Wilson to serve a three-year term on the Board of Selectmen. Wilson defeated Jean Kane by a 49-13 vote. Patty Olds defeated incumbent town treasurer Prudence Foster by a 40-19 vote.
"When I moved here four years ago (from Falmouth) and found out the town office was only open two days a week, I said that's the kind of town government I like," Wilson said. "I'm not running to change things. I like things the way they are."
Before the meeting, Patricia Harcourt, chairman of the selectmen, said she did not expect residents would oppose passage of a $668,614 municipal and school budget, which will keep the town's tax rate flat at $11.26 per $1,000 of taxable property value.
The budget includes $480,000 for school expenses, most of which is spent on tuition to send the town's 90 students to area elementary and high schools. Arrowsic does not have its own school. LICENSE FEES
Resident commercial digger: $100
Non-resident commercial: $200

TOWN DEBATES AQUACULTURE PLAN FOR BAY LOBSTERMEN AND BOATERS FEAR A SHELLFISH FARM IN HARPSWELL WOULD PUSH THEM OUT OF QUAHOG BAY.

Abstract: A proposed aquaculture project in Quahog Bay would not impede anchoring, lobstering or fishing, according to the Searsmont man who hopes to grow oysters and quahogs off Snow Island. Eric Peters said Thursday that he would even consider reducing by half the area he hopes to farm. But he doubts that will be necessary when people understand how little impact his operation would have on existing uses. Peters has applied to lease 7.5 acres of state-controlled waters to establish an aquaculture operation over the next 10 years. The proposal will be presented to the Department of Marine Resources at a public hearing at 7 p.m. June 30 at the Harpswell Islands School.

Full text: A proposed aquaculture project in Quahog Bay would not impede anchoring, lobstering or fishing, according to the Searsmont man who hopes to grow oysters and quahogs off Snow Island.
Eric Peters said Thursday that he would even consider reducing by half the area he hopes to farm. But he doubts that will be necessary when people understand how little impact his operation would have on existing uses.
"I'm looking to not bother anyone," Peters said.
Peters has applied to lease 7.5 acres of state-controlled waters to establish an aquaculture operation over the next 10 years. The proposal will be presented to the Department of Marine Resources at a public hearing at 7 p.m. June 30 at the Harpswell Islands School.
On Monday, selectmen met with local lobstermen and boaters who were worried that they would be squeezed out of the popular bay.
Selectman Gordon Weil said Peters was "very reasonable and constructive" during their conversations. But the town will continue to act as an "intervenor" in the case to ensure that his lease specifically protects boaters and fishermen.
Residents will have an opportunity during the hearing to present evidence for and against the proposal.
Peters said his operation will be unobtrusive because of the way he plans to grow the shellfish.
One method of seeding is to plant the shellfish on the ocean floor in trays or bags. Those devices would be destroyed by lobster traps and boat anchors dropping on them.
But Peters plans to plant 270,000 baby oysters and quahogs directly on the ocean floor where they will not be bothered by that kind of activity.
One resident told selectmen that he had hoped to drag for the naturally occurring oysters once they mature, which would clearly interfere with Peters' operation. Peters said that he plans to meet with him today.
"I don't think he wants to drag in the same area," said Peters, whose lease would start 200 to 300 feet off the north shore of Snow Island.
Peters, who has worked in the aquaculture business since 1988, acknowledges that he is taking a risk.
The ocean floor in Quahog Bay is covered with deep silt, which is not the best condition for planting oysters. But he was attracted by the bay's warm water and the protection it provides against strong wind and currents.
Those are the same properties that make it a well-known anchorage for pleasure boaters from around the world.
It will be a while before Peters makes any money from his aquaculture experiment. It takes three years for quahogs to grow, and two to three years for oysters, he said. "I'm looking to not bother anyone." Eric Peters

TRIBE AGREES TO PLEA DEAL IN FISHING CONTROVERSY BUT TWO OF THE INDIANS CONTINUE TO FIGHT, CLAIMING ANCESTRAL RIGHTS.

Abstract: Eight Passamaquoddy Indians pleaded no contest to violating conservation laws under an agreement in which prosecutors dropped charges that they fished without licenses. The group was accused of digging for shellfish from contaminated flats, taking sea urchins out of season and keeping undersized clams. The tribe agreed to pay fines of more than $4,000. But two Passamaquoddy fishermen, Joseph Sapiel and Roger Brackett, declined the plea agreement and pleaded innocent to charges of taking shellfish from a contaminated area.

Full text:   Eight Passamaquoddy Indians pleaded no contest to violating conservation laws under an agreement in which prosecutors dropped charges that they fished without licenses.
The group was accused of digging for shellfish from contaminated flats, taking sea urchins out of season and keeping undersized clams. The tribe agreed to pay fines of more than $4,000.
District Judge John Romei also dismissed licensing charges against another seven members of the tribe.
But two Passamaquoddy fishermen, Joseph Sapiel and Roger Brackett, declined the plea agreement and pleaded innocent to charges of taking shellfish from a contaminated area.
They will stand trial next month.
Tribal officials have argued since the arrest of the first of the fishermen two years ago that the state has no jurisdiction because of Native American ancestral fishing rights.
The Legislature's approval of a limited aboriginal fishing rights law in April led to the negotiated settlement.
Under the law, tribal fishermen are subject to state marine conservation laws and regulations. But they are exempt from the need to hold state commercial fishing licenses as long as they fish for the sustenance of tribal members and their immediate families.
Sapiel said he felt the tribe let him down. He maintains that he has an ancestral right to fish and hunt anywhere and that the tribe could not bargain away that right.
Brackett said he did not know the area where he was digging for clams was contaminated because a sign had been knocked down. "Nobody wants to get sick if it's contaminated," he said.
Passamaquoddy Lt. Gov. William Altvater said the state should have dismissed all the charges.
But Altvater said he decided against a fight because he wants to save energy for more important disputes, such as the tribe's assertion that it is entitled to hunt federally protected porpoise.

MAINE LOBSTERS ARE HIS PASSION BOSTON-BASED CHEF JASPER WHITE SERVES UP ELEGANT AND SIMPLE WAYS TO PREPARE LOBSTER IN HIS NEW BOOK, `LOBSTER AT HOME.'

Author: MOLLY O'NEILL The New York Times

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]17 June 1998: 1C.

Abstract: "Lobster is life," [Jasper] White said, sucking a leg from his breakfast lobster on the patio of his home outside Boston. Americans may cook, crack, savor and chew lobster at a rate of about 65,000 tons a year, he said, but few have fully experienced the range of flavor and texture hidden in the crannies of its carapace. "The whole thing about lobster is that every step of the way it's a one-on-one duel," White said. "First it's the lobster facing off with the fisherman. Then the cook. Then the diner. There's nothing easy about a lobster. This is all very primitive stuff, and I believe that's the appeal." White does not discriminate against lobster in any season.

Full text: Most lobster lovers turn manic in mid-May when, for six slender weeks, the king of Atlantic crustaceans is hard-shelled, gloriously sweet - and so plentiful that its price can dip from the nearly prohibitive to the very possible.
Jasper White reacts more intensely than your average lobster fanatic.
The same sun that summons lobsters from winter's indolence to a feeding frenzy prompts White to haul out tall pots, stoke his custom-made 48-inch grill and begin preaching the particulars of lobster cookery with the passion of a tent revivalist.
White, the former chef and owner of Restaurant Jasper and now a consulting chef for Legal Seafood in Boston, just recently published his 241-page primer, "Lobster at Home," with Scribner.
"Lobster is life," White said, sucking a leg from his breakfast lobster on the patio of his home outside Boston. Americans may cook, crack, savor and chew lobster at a rate of about 65,000 tons a year, he said, but few have fully experienced the range of flavor and texture hidden in the crannies of its carapace.
As a public service, therefore, White guided a visitor through a contemplative lobster tasting, as well as six cooking techniques.
He strode to a shaded corner of his patio where a dozen lobsters were slamming the sides of a waxed cardboard crate like boxers against the ropes. White flexed his hands.
He grasped his selection behind the head - those rubber bands around the claws are not foolproof. "I learned the hard way," he said. Still, he added, "you want a lobster that's going to put up a good fight. Sluggish, sleepy guys have been sitting around in pens or tanks. They are stressed, and their meat shows it."
White's grayish hair was Einstein-wild in the New England breeze. Bearded and bearlike, he looked a little bit old salt and a little bit like a pasha, as he moved from the lobster box to the pots in his kitchen, from microwave oven to saute pan, from broiler to backyard grill.
He limited his remarks to Homarus americanus, better known as American or Maine lobster, which is primarily caught off the coast of Maine and Nova Scotia, and accounts for nearly all the live lobsters sold in the United States. In a good season, which this is expected to be, its price can drop to about $5 a pound.
Lobster is one of the few Atlantic seafoods whose supply has been steady for more than 100 years. For almost half a century, it has been illegal to sell or harvest a lobster below a minimum length, which generally equals less than a pound. And this, along with their natural resilience - lobsters have been around for 2 million years, White said - seems to have protected their numbers.
They've been fished the same way for more than a century: wood-slatted traps, attached to a line and a buoy, are dropped in waters 20 to 1,500 feet deep. These contraptions have two compartments: one called "the parlor," and directly behind it, "the kitchen," which is where the bait sits. (Lobsters are lured by almost any other seafood, though crabs seem to be their favorite.) Once a lobster enters the shallow kitchen, it can't turn around to get out. The traps are pulled up daily, the lobsters tossed into a box on deck, fresh bait is put into the traps, and the traps are submerged once again.
"The whole thing about lobster is that every step of the way it's a one-on-one duel," White said. "First it's the lobster facing off with the fisherman. Then the cook. Then the diner. There's nothing easy about a lobster. This is all very primitive stuff, and I believe that's the appeal."
Now, when New England waters have begun to warm and the legal lobster season has opened in Canada, lobsters are hard shelled and absolutely delicious. They're feeding ravenously, bulking up and offering cooks unlimited possibilities.
By early July, lobsters molt, and their shells soften. The meat is sweet, but very delicate and mushy, best suited for boiling and picking for salads.
In October, lobster is great again: the new shells have hardened, and are full of buttery, sweet, firm meat. They remain that way until late December.
After that, they're semi-dormant until late March. Most of the lobsters sold in the winter come from Canadian lobster pounds, salt-water storage pens. They are hard shelled and firm enough, but bland and expensive - as high as $15 a pound.
White does not discriminate against lobster in any season. Like a lobster, he exploits any opportunity to feed. And he is tireless in dispelling lobster myth. Contrary to popular belief, for instance, White said that male and female lobsters taste the same. And up to a point, size means nothing.
"In all my years of cooking and eating, I've detected no difference in lobsters between the one pound and five," he said.
He once cooked a nine-pound lobster. It was scary to contend with and tough to eat. "The giants should be left as breeding stock," he said.
It takes a lobster seven to eight years to grow to be a pound. "That means they've molted about 25 times and beaten odds of about 1,000 to 1 for surviving," White said reverentially. Until they reach that size, lobsters are vulnerable to almost everything in the ocean. After that, their predators are limited to bigger lobsters and people like White.
He can argue the pros and cons of boiling, steaming, microwaving and grilling with more authority than anyone else. He also coined the term "pan roasting," a combination of stove-top cooking and oven roasting, which he employs in his signature pan-roasted lobsterwith chervil and chives.
White's most idiosyncratic practice is his lengthy cooking time. Most cookbooks, for instance, recommend steaming a pound-and-a-half lobster for 12 minutes. White steams the same lobster for 14 minutes.
"Unlike all other fish and shellfish, lobster is at its best when it's cooked completely," he said, whirling like an extra-large dervish between kitchen and patio.
But first, there is the live, flailing beast and the cook's moment of truth.
Speed, White said, is merciful lobstercide: "Not that I think a lobster can feel, but I can." (Most scientists agree - lobsters don't experience pain.)
Boiling or steaming are instant death. When a recipe for a sauteed, broiled or baked dish calls for a raw, split lobster, he said that a swiftly deployed medium-size Chinese cleaver is the most humane tool.
Then, in less than half an hour, he prepared 10 recipes, using six techniques. He had also steamed two lobsters. White believes that lobster should first be tasted unembellished by seasonings - as a wine should first be tasted without food.
"You have to establish the gold standard before you can judge a recipe," he said.
The creatures cool quickly, and to eat the most lobster meat at the highest temperature, eat the tail first, then the knuckles and next the claws. This sequence has a flavor advantage, too: the tastes progress from delicate to intense flavors, from salty to sweet.
White, like many lobster lovers, devours everything that is actually edible in a precise, almost ritualistic manner. He held the thick center of the body, the carcass, of one steamed lobster in his right hand, the tail in his left hand, grasped each part and twisted. The resulting separation was nearly slop-free. He set the tail on the counter, and then, grabbing the tail fins, he bent them backward until they snapped off.
The meat in the two center tail fins remained attached to the tail. He quickly sucked the tiny pods of meat left in the outer tail fins: briny, sweet and watery, they readied the taste sensors for the meal.
Inserting a small fork in the end of the tail, he pushed the meat forward, wiggling it slightly. Once the tail was freed, he used a lobster pick to loosen, extract and discard the intestine, which in a very fresh lobster is blue-brown in color.
He sliced the meat and popped it into his mouth. The base note of the taste of a lobster tail is sweet, the leitmotif briny. Hints of bitterness, so subtle as to be indiscernible, leave a round, delicate taste in the mouth.
"But you can't escape the fact that even delicacy is a play of good and evil," White said.
Quickly, he twisted both knuckles from the carcass, and twisted each claw free. He used a lobster cracker to break the knuckle shell and a fork to push out the meat.
"One of life's sweet moments," White said, cracking the larger, upper claw section with a knife. He grabbed the smaller, lower section and wiggled it until it snapped. He pulled it away from the rest of the shell. The meat emerged, intact. With a fork, he wiggled the remaining meat though the claw.
Because of their higher water content, the claws are softer and more aggressively salty. White sucked the meat out of the legs and moved on to the carcass, where he scooped out the soft, buttery green liver, called the tomalley.
Tenderly, using his small, two-pronged fork, White tugged the pockets of sweet, meat from between the lobster gills. And finally, towering over a heap of empty shells, he was a man at peace.
Here is White's recipe for pan-roasted lobster:
Jasper's Pan-Roasted Lobster Time: 20 minutes
2 live 1 1/2 - to 2-pound lobsters
2 tablespoons peanut oil
2 shallots, minced
1/4 cup bourbon
2 to 3 tablespoons dry white wine
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and chilled
1 tablespoon chervil, finely chopped
1 tablespoon chives, finely chopped
Kosher or sea salt to taste
Freshly ground black pepper to taste
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Place a lobster on a cutting board, facing you. Place the front tip of the knife or cleaver in the center of the lobster, near where the carcass meets the tail. In one forceful, swift motion, split the front half of the lobster, which will kill the lobster instantly. Turn the lobster around, and repeat this motion, splitting the tail and the lobster in half.
Pull the head sac out of both halves. Use fingers or surgical tweezers to remove the intestines. Using a knife, cleaver or shears, remove the claws and knuckles by cutting the thin section where the knuckle meets the carcass. With the back of the knife or cleaver, tap the claws until the shell cracks.
In one swift, forceful motion, cut the head away from the tail on both sides of the lobster, quartering it.
Place the lobster tomalley and roe, if there is any, in a small bowl. Using a fork, break the mass into tiny pieces, cover and refrigerate.
Place a heavy 12-inch saute pan over the highest heat possible, and heat for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the oil, and heat until it forms a film over the bottom of the pan. Slide the lobster, shell side down, into the hot oil. Using tongs, move the pieces and flatten them to sear all the shells evenly. The claws need to be seared on only one side.
Add the tomalley and roe; stir, and place in the oven for 3 minutes. Remove, return to high heat on the stove and add the shallots and stir. Remove the pan from the heat, and add the bourbon; return to the heat, where the bourbon will probably ignite. Cook until the flames die down, and then add the wine and cook until all the liquid in the pan is almost dry. Reduce the heat to low.
Quickly remove the lobster, and place, shell side down, on warm plates. Return pan to low heat, add butter, chervil and chives and stir until the mixture resembles a creamy sauce, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper to taste, spoon sauce over lobster and serve.
Yield: 2 generous main courses.

Full text:   Local fishermen and boaters fear that plans to raise clams and oysters in an aquaculture operation off Snow Island will shut them out of a popular anchorage and fishing area.
Eric Peters, a biologist, has applied to the state Department of Marine Resources for a 10-year lease of 7.5 acres of state-controlled waters north of the island.
The lease could give him exclusive rights to use the area to raise and harvest quahogs and Eastern oysters.
"I hope they give it a lot of consideration before they let one individual hurt a lot of people who are making a living there," said Vincent Oppedisano, who has spent 25 years trapping lobsters in the area, and who now worries that Peters' aquaculture business could damage his livelihood.
Selectmen on Thursday plan to discuss how they will respond to such concerns when they intervene on behalf of the people currently using the area. The state has scheduled a public hearing for 7 p.m. June 30 at the Harpswell Islands School.
The tensions being raised in Harpswell mirror concerns elsewhere about how new aquaculture operations will affect areas traditionally open to the public.
In West Bath and Brunswick, for example, local clam diggers are objecting to a proposal by an Eliot shellfish depuration plant to gain exclusive rights to dig in New Meadows Lake. A decision on that application is not expected for several months.
If state officials approve Peters' proposal in Harpswell, other uses would not necessarily be excluded from the area. Inmost cases, the state does not decide between one exclusive use and another.
"We encourage maximum multiple uses of the site," said E. Penn Estabrook, deputy commissioner of marine resources.
All leases come with conditions outlining what may be done in the area. Often those conditions allay the concerns of other users, Estabrook said.
But Andrew Pennell, a lobsterman from Great Island, said he does not see how lobstering and aquaculture could co-exist.
Lobster traps are dropped onto the ocean floor, where Peters plans to set up trays of oysters and clams. Over the course of the summer, Pennell said, lobstermen could set as many as 200 to 300 traps in that area.
"We're getting crowded out of a lot of places," Pennell said.
Oppedisano said the area is most heavily fished this time of year, when lobsters are closer to shore. He has 75 traps in the area now.
In addition to being a productive area for lobstering, the spot also is popular as an anchorage for pleasure boaters attracted to the protected harbor.
Estabrook explained that the hearing is a formal proceeding at which people testify and are cross examined on the record.
The public is permitted to speak, but they must present clear evidence on how Peters' proposal will affect them or their business.
Selectman Gordon Weil said one resident is concerned that he will not be allowed to drag for oysters after enduring a long wait for them to mature.
Estabrook said that is not considered an on-going business, but isworth mentioning at the hearing. The issue of available anchorages also is a consideration for state officials.
Peters' application calls for him to spend the first five years planting young oysters and clams to establish a viable habitat. "I hope they give it a lot of consideration before they let one individual hurt a lot of people who are making a living there." Vincent Oppedisano, lobsterman

Abstract: Maine rivers swollen by torrential weekend rains began to recede late Monday and residents around Sebago Lake used the break in the weather to recover boats and docks pummeled by rain-swept waves. "It just kept on and on and on," Roy Cox of Sebago said of the rain as he repaired a dock Monday afternoon. Floodwaters still covered portions of dozens of secondary roads and filled basements throughout the region Monday. The weather service posted a flood watch for all of Maine east of the Penobscot River, and there was a flood warning for the Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers, which were still above flood stage late Monday.

Full text: Maine rivers swollen by torrential weekend rains began to recede late Monday and residents around Sebago Lake used the break in the weather to recover boats and docks pummeled by rain-swept waves.
"It just kept on and on and on," Roy Cox of Sebago said of the rain as he repaired a dock Monday afternoon.
The lull in the weather was temporary, however, as more showers and thunderstorms pushed over the region Monday night and were expected to linger through much of the week. The rain threatened to push rivers back up over their banks today.
Weekend rains totaling as much as 8 inches and winds as strong as 53 mph caused property damage across southern Maine. The storm also may have contributed to a death.
The body of a 41-year-old Farmington man was foundin his flooded basement. It wasn't immediately clear how he died.
While Monday provided a break from the storms for most people, airline passengers at Portland International Jetport had to wait to take off until thick fog lifted during the morning and again in the evening.
The fog, rain and winds were caused by a huge mid-level low-pressure system hovering over the Northeast. That system could fuel showers throughout the week, said Art Lester of the National Weather Service. "The thing's sitting still," he said.
Lester said rain that was expected to continue through much of today could add another inch or so to the more than 8 inches that fell in many areas over the weekend. "It was a lot of water," he said.
Floodwaters still covered portions of dozens of secondary roads and filled basements throughout the region Monday. The weather service posted a flood watch for all of Maine east of the Penobscot River, and there was a flood warning for the Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers, which were still above flood stage late Monday.
The Presumpscot and Saco rivers had receded below flood stage. The lower Saco River is expected to gradually rise through York County for a few days but not reach flood stage.
The Maine Emergency Management Agency said there were no riverside evacuations, except for one elderly York County woman who wanted to be taken to a relative's home.
National Guard troops and volunteers sandbagged a dam in Monmouth to keep it from bursting and damaging homes downstream.
"There could be more problems with tonight's rain," said Tom Hawley, a meteorologist with the weather service in Gray. "I expect (rivers) will start to go back up."
Floodwaters carrying debris and untreated sewage into coastal waters prompted the state to ban shellfish harvesting from Kittery to Port Clyde.
Small rivers and streams rushing into Maine's second largest lake pushed the surface of Sebago up at least 6 inches. And winds that gusted over 40 mph pushed waves several feet high against the western shore, tossing some boats onto rocks or beaches, sinking others, and damaging docks and seawalls.
Cox, owner of Sebago Lake Family Campground in Sebago, took apart his dock Monday afternoon after it got twisted and stuck between the shore and a large rock.
"Usually it's on the other side of that rock," he said. "The lake just lifted it right over. . . . I've been here since 1986. I've never seen it this high."
Cox looked up the shoreline, where a pontoon boat was wedged onto a rocky section of shoreline. The whole boat was warped and both pontoons were crumpled. "I'm pretty lucky, actually," Cox said.
Charlie Frechette of Sebago Lake Marina said the waves were 6 to 7 feet high - "hurricane style" waves. "Anybody that has a dock on the west shore, they're either gone or they're damaged," he said.
Business owners in the riverside city of Hallowell nervously watched the Kennebec, as the swollen river reached across parking lots and lapped the ground close to the backdoors of some shops.
"I really don't think it's going to get any higher," Bob Ladd, owner of the Kennebec Wharf, said as he set bar stools on the floor for the evening's business. "If it does, we can clean this place out in 40 minutes."
Dozens of state and local roads remained temporarily closed to traffic. The state Transportation Department said its crews were trying to post warnings in inundated areas as soon as they were reported.
In Farmington, the body of Veron Ash, 41, was recovered from his basement, which was flooded by about a foot of water, police said. It was unclear whether Ash's death was related to the rainstorm; an autopsy was planned.

Abstract: Voters have rejected a request to double the local utility district's debt limit in order to pay for a new $5.5 million wastewater treatment plant. Without the money, the project can't go forward, according to Waldoboro Utility District Superintendent John Fancy. Utility district trustees will meet June 18 to discuss a simple question with a not-so-simple answer: What next? The meeting will be held at 4 p.m., at the district office in Waldoboro. It is open to the public.

Full text: Voters have rejected a request to double the local utility district's debt limit in order to pay for a new $5.5 million wastewater treatment plant.
Without the money, the project can't go forward, according to Waldoboro Utility District Superintendent John Fancy.
Utility district trustees will meet June 18 to discuss a simple question with a not-so-simple answer: What next? The meeting will be held at 4 p.m., at the district office in Waldoboro. It is open to the public.
District officials will hold public information sessions and a public hearing this fall to better inform residents about their plans. Meanwhile, they have taken an option on some land, and intend to continue with preliminary planning.
The wastewater-treatment project is not dead, despite Tuesday's vote.
The town has secured $4.5 million in state and federal grants, and the offer of a $1 million federal loan if it can increase the district's debt limit to borrow the money from the federal government.
Waldoboro's current debt limit is $1 million, of which $340,000 has already been spent replacing the sewer on Main Street. That leaves $660,000, which district officials would prefer to keep in reserve for emergencies.
If no money is spent on the project before the end of this year, the funds will go to another town.
A call to the district Thursday found Fancy in a dejected mood.
"I'm really disappointed," he said. "We had a public hearing on it, but just a few showed up. I thought we did enough publicity. I'm not sure why people turned it down."
The vote against expanding the debt limit was 532-415.
Fancy figures voters didn't understand the complex issue. "It's a good project for Waldoboro, but it's hard to reach people with the message," he said.
There is no town tax money involved. Out of 5,000 residents, some 2,000 people hooked up to the public sewer line would be affected.
Savings in operational costs for the more efficient new plant would cut sewer-usage fees - already high in Waldoboro, at an average of $330 a household per year.
On balance, Utility District customers wouldn't have felt a pinch, according to Fancy.
The town's existing plant, built in 1968, discharges 120,000 gallons of treated wastewater daily into the Medomak River. The new facility, a lagoon-type plant scheduled to open in 1999, would spray treated wastewater on 50 acres of land instead.
The new plant will be located away from the shore of the Medomak River, which would open up more areas for shellfish harvesting.
District officials, who have been searching for land for five years, believe they have found a likely 100-acre site with room to expand that has good soil, no wetlands, and is away from residential populations.
The city of Rockland faced a similar situation last year.
Voters refused to authorize an $8.5 million bond to raise the money to match funding they were getting from the state and federal government. The money was needed to upgrade and expand an aging sewer plant with a water-pollution problem.
In response, the Department of Environmental Protection imposed a moratorium on new sewer hookups. Residents voted for their sewage-upgrade project last fall.
"The moratorium made people realize the situation was serious," said Martha Kirkpatrick, director of the Department of Environmental Protection agency's Bureau of Land and Water Quality.
According to Fancy, the Waldoboro Utility District is in compliance with its license most of the time.
"But it's an old plant," he said. "And any discharge into the river is not a goodthing."
Voters have until Nov. 3 to make a final decision on the plant. "If we don't get approval by then, the project is dead," Fancy said.

Abstract: Mark Howard was browsing in a second-hand book shop in Boston when he came across an 1895 cookbook titled "The Bachelor and the Chafing Dish." The book, written tongue-in-cheek, tells how a man can attract and woo a woman by serving her meals made in a chafing dish. Howard snapped it up, as he has hundreds of other unusual and out-of-print cookbooks. His collection, filling five bookcases in his Portland home, includes a potato cookbook with a forward by Truman Capote, a 1937 cookbook for people livingin trailers and a nostalgic book by Robert P. Tristram Coffin, the novelist, remembering foods that he ate growing up in Maine. Collecting cookbooks is a popular pastime. Serious collectors typically focus on a particular interest, such as hotel and restaurant cookbooks, dishes made with Jell-O or, in Howard's case, classic cookbooks from the mid-1900s. Cookbooks tend to be inexpensive; even the rarest ones sell for less than $2,000. Most collectors buy books "out of passion" rather than as an investment, said Barbara Haber, curator of books at Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library, which has a well-known cookbook collection.

Full text: Mark Howard was browsing in a second-hand book shop in Boston when he came across an 1895 cookbook titled "The Bachelor and the Chafing Dish." The book, written tongue-in-cheek, tells how a man can attract and woo a woman by serving her meals made in a chafing dish.
Howard snapped it up, as he has hundreds of other unusual and out-of-print cookbooks. His collection, filling five bookcases in his Portland home, includes a potato cookbook with a forward by Truman Capote, a 1937 cookbook for people livingin trailers and a nostalgic book by Robert P. Tristram Coffin, the novelist, remembering foods that he ate growing up in Maine.
The books, about 1,000 altogether, are more than a source of recipes. Howard uses them to learn about American history, different regions of the country and the changing roles of men and women. He describes himself as a "student of history as told through the kitchen door."
Collecting cookbooks is a popular pastime. Serious collectors typically focus on a particular interest, such as hotel and restaurant cookbooks, dishes made with Jell-O or, in Howard's case, classic cookbooks from the mid-1900s. Cookbooks tend to be inexpensive; even the rarest ones sell for less than $2,000. Most collectors buy books "out of passion" rather than as an investment, said Barbara Haber, curator of books at Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library, which has a well-known cookbook collection.
Howard, who works as a musician and arts administrator, said he feels sentimental about his cookbook library.
"A lot of the past, I think, is really becoming lost and forgotten, even discredited and denigrated," he said. "These books represent for me a wonderful and a very interesting time that's gone by."
Howard, 45, lives alone in a modest ranch. The 1950s-era kitchen features a two-burner, Frigidaire Flair Range, a challenge to any serious cook. He's learned to adapt, sauteeing foods in the oven when needed. He's an adventuresome cook whose specialties include French pastries, curries and Hungarian dishes.
Howard is a gracious host. On a recent morning, he served a guest French roast coffee in oversized cups and corn muffins from a recipe in "Duncan Hines' Food Odyssey." He bought the book, signed by Duncan Hines, for only $1.
Howard grew up in Topsfield, Mass. One side of his family is Italian, the other Arabic. They loved to cook, making a lot of ethnic dishes.
As a young man, Howard dreamed of opening his own restaurant. He cooked at the Firepond Restaurant in Blue Hill, aCape Cod hotel and a hunting lodge on Moosehead Lake.
But his life took other paths. He managed the Bookland store in Auburn for three years, then began working at Bates College. He now teaches piano at Bates, serves as administrative assistant in the music department and helps plan concerts and other events. He also performs as a classical pianist.
Honoring regionalism
Howard bought his first old cookbook about 20 years ago. Published by the Ford Motor Co., it features recipes from restaurants throughout the country, including many that Howard had visited as a boy.
Collecting cookbooks seemed a natural blend of Howard's interests in American history, books and cooking. Over time, he began to focus on particular topics, such as the Boston Cooking School of the late 18th and early 19th century.
The school trained women to work as domestic servants and cooking teachers. But its influence spread far beyond that. Fannie Farmer, who became principal of the school, and several of the teacherspublished cookbooks, endorsed products and lectured throughout the country.
At the turn of the century, women eagerly awaited what was seen as the coming of the "scientific age."
"Disease was going to be cured," Howard said. "Raising children was all going to be systematized. Cooking was all going to be elevated to a very high art, and they were going to be able to do it efficiently."
While the 20th century did bring new cooking gadgets and ranges, women still found themselves confined inthe kitchen. And many men looked on cooking as unmasculine. Howard's collection includes a 1944 cookbook, "200 Dishes for Men to Cook," aimed at convincing men that they, too, belonged at the stove.
The 1950s brought a boom in cookbook publishing.
"America was beginning to try to define itself in terms of a national cuisine and identity," said Howard. ". . . Through food and cookbooks, it was becoming aware of its regionality."
Interest in cooking has grown ever since. But Howard noted anirony; even as people buy more cookbooks and spend more time watching cooking show on television, they actually do less cooking.
Howard buys some of his books from the handful of book sellers around the country who specialize in culinary material. He's picked up others at book stores or yard sales, paying from 50 cents to more than $100. He buys some books mainly for their beautiful graphics or photographs. He also purchases cooking calendars, old cooking magazines and advertising ephemera.
His oldest book, "The Cook's Oracle," was written by a British physician in 1827. Like many cookbooks at that time, it serves as an all-purpose household manual, with instructions on making glue, raising children, picking oysters and staining wooden stairs to look like marble.
His collection also includes:
# A facsimile of the first U.S. cookbook, "American Cookery," written by Amelia Simmons in 1796. "She saw that people were using 18th century British cookbooks that weren't pertinent to the Americanlifestyle or ingredients," Howard said. Simmons featured cranberries, pumpkins and other, native foods.
# "Cooking in Old Creole Days," written in both English and Creole French. The book, first published in 1903, includes stereotypical drawings of African Americans, including a boy carrying a stalk of stolen onions. The book also contains the music and lyrics to Creole folk songs.
# "The Mary Frances Cookbook." This 1912 book reads like a children's story. When Mary Frances' parents go away, kitchen implements come alive and teach her how to cook.
Howard's library includes several, old New England cookbooks. He owns a 1763 recipe collection from Mrs. Silvester Gardiner, a Boston matron whose family settled what now is the town of Gardiner.
He also has a pamphlet (circa 1916) of dessert recipes printed by the Schlotterbeck and Foss Co. of Portland, makers of flavorings and extracts. Another book, "Prize Winning Maine Recipes," was published about 50 years ago by Boone's Restaurant on Custom House Wharf.
Howard has talked about his collection at Radcliffe College and to an Elderhostel group at Bates. Last month, he gave a seminar on learning about history through cookbooks at the University of Southern Maine Center for Continuing Education.
"I feel a sense of deep satisfaction," he said, "when I think about how collecting these books is preserving a disappearing and very significant cultural past."
HERE ARE A COUPLE of Howard's favorite recipes from his cookbook collection.
The Coach House Bread
and Butter Pudding
12 small thin slices French
bread
5 eggs
4 egg yolks
1 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
4 cups (1 quart) milk
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
confectioners' sugar
Trim crusts from the bread, and butter each slice on one side. Beat together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, and salt until thoroughly blended. Combine the milk and cream in a saucepan, scald, but do not boil. Stir gradually into egg mixture and stir in the vanilla extract. Butter a 2-quart baking disk. Line it with the bread, buttered side up. Strain milk, cream, and egg mixture over bread; straining this custard through a strainer makes for a more satiny pudding. Set baking dish into a large roasting pan containing about 1 inch water. Bake pudding in a preheated moderate oven (375 degrees) for about 45 minutes or until pudding tests done. Sprinkle generously with confectioners' sugar and glaze quickly under hot broiler. Serve hot or cool.
Serves 6-8
- "American Home Cooking"
by Nika Hazelton NY: 1981
Lamb Shanks
with Beans
4 lamb shanks
1 large clove garlic, finely
chopped
1 large onion, sliced
2 stalks celery, finely sliced
2 carrots, sliced
2 tablespoons finely chopped
parsley
2 cups solid pack tomatoes
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2 cups tiny white navy beans
Wash beans, pick over, and be on guard for bits of gravel or pebbles resembling beans - you'll be a candiate for the dentist's chair. In a large heavy kettle, saute the chopped garlic and onion, add the celery, carrots, parsley, tomatoes, and salt and pepper, then add the beans and hot water to cover. Cover with a heavy lid and simmer about an hour and a half, adding more water, stock, or tomato juice, as necessary. Brown lamb shanks and add to the beans. Cover and simmer until meat and beans are tender. If you have the remains of Sunday's leg of lamb in the icebox, the bones can be simmered with the beans for the first hour and a half and removed when the shanks are added. The more flavor the better.

Abstract: Voters in five towns in Lincoln and Knox counties were asked to pass a 1998-99 budget of $13.5 million for School Administrative District 40. The budget is 6.1 percent higher than this year's and, if passed, would result in a property-tax increase of 48 cents per $1,000 for homeowners in Friendship, 62 cents in Union, 63 cents in Waldoboro, 83 cents in Warren and one cent in Washington.

Full text: Voters in five towns in Lincoln and Knox counties were asked to pass a 1998-99 budget of $13.5 million for School Administrative District 40.
The budget is 6.1 percent higher than this year's and, if passed, would result in a property-tax increase of 48 cents per $1,000 for homeowners in Friendship, 62 cents in Union, 63 cents in Waldoboro, 83 cents in Warren and one cent in Washington.
Final results of the budget vote were not ready at 11 p.m. Tuesday.
In Damariscotta, Richard McLean won the selectmen's race, defeating Scott Gove by a vote of 163-137.
In Waldoboro, where more than 1,000 people turned out to vote, eight people were still busy counting ballots at 11 p.m. Results of voting for selectman, for water district trustee and for a water district debt increase were not available.
Voters were asked to approve doubling the debt limit of the Waldoboro Utility District Charter to $2 million.
The money would help pave the way for a new $5.5 million wastewater treatment plant away from the Medomak River, which would open up more shellfish harvesting.
In 1996, Waldoboro got $3.5 million from the Department of Environmental Protection as part of a bond issue that addressed treatment plants. "If we don't start spending it by the end of this year, they're going to give it to someone else," said Water District Superintendent John Fancy.
On Tuesday, lawyers drew up an option on a parcel of land.

SEA MINK CLAIMED THE COAST OF MAINE AS ITS ONLY HOME NOW IT IS KNOWN ONLY FROM ITS BONE FRAGMENTS IN SHELL HEAPS.

Abstract: A man whose father had been a fur buyer in the Penobscot Bay region 75 years before provides the only contemporary description. Manly Hardy, in "The Extinct Mink from the Maine Shell Heaps" (1903), says the fur was "much coarser and . . . of a more reddish color" than that of the "woods mink." The sea mink was twice the latter's size and usually very fat, with a "peculiar" smell.

Full text: If ever there were a mammal of Maine, it wasthe sea mink. One has to use the past tense now, regrettably, because it is no more. It was shot, hunted with dogs and dug out of its hiding places until extinction claimed the species.
A man whose father had been a fur buyer in the Penobscot Bay region 75 years before provides the only contemporary description. Manly Hardy, in "The Extinct Mink from the Maine Shell Heaps" (1903), says the fur was "much coarser and . . . of a more reddish color" than that of the "woods mink." The sea mink was twice the latter's size and usually very fat, with a "peculiar" smell.
Today, only bone fragments exist in Native American shell heaps dating back 5,000 years. Dr. Arthur Spiess, who knows more about the sea mink than any other person alive, says it had much more powerful muscles in its jaws and forelimbs than does the common mink, with a broad final molar more suitable for crushing than shearing. Green sea urchins and other shellfish may have been staple fare. Its distinctive smell indicates different scent glands, too.
The sea mink was an all-Maine animal, ranging from Casco Bay east possibly to New Brunswick at Passamaquoddy Bay, making its disappearance all the sadder. It survived into the 20th century, and perhaps as long as the 1920s. Spiess, a Maine state archaeologist, knows older residents around Boothbay and Penobscot Bay who, in their childhoods, had known people who had seen giant mink.
Now it is gone, like the great auk with whose bones it shares the shell heaps - while we lament the loss of such as these from our North Atlantic world.

Full text: William A. "Bill" Traber, 73, of Pine Hill Road North for more than 30 years died Friday at his home after a long illness.
He was born in Cincinnati, a son of August G. and Madelene Kispert Traber, and was a 1950 graduate of the College Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati with a bachelor of music degree. He later earned a certificate in business management from New York University.
During World War II he served in the Army Air Forces as an air operations specialist attached to a fighter training base.
Mr. Traber had been on the Ogunquit Playhouse staff since 1960, and was business manager for nearly 20 years before retiring in 1997. He also managed the Whistling Oyster Gift Shop here, and was involved in antiques as a partner in Traber and Hoe for more than 35 years.
He was a lucite sculptor and his work was displayed in many galleries throughout the United States, including the Hobe Sound Galleries in Florida, his family said.
Mr. Traber performed with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra as a second timpanist and had his own dance band. He also was a percussionist with the New York City Center Orchestra for two seasons and spent a summer with the Louisville Summer Opera Company. He was employed with the New York City Ballet Orchestra, NBC Guest Relations and public school music departments in Maine and New Hampshire.
His wife, Joanne Traber, died previously.
Surviving are a sister, Marjorie Palmer of Dayton, Ohio; two nieces, Pamela Deremiah and Julie Langer, both of Centerville, Ohio; and a nephew, Craig Palmer of Indianapolis.
A memorial service will be held at a later date. Arrangements are by LaFrance-Lambert Funeral Home, Sanford.

UNCLE BILLY'S: SAME FINGER-LICKING, PIG-OUT PORTIONS OF YORE

Abstract: Uncle Billy's is back. The original restaurant, Billy's Southside BBQ, closed in 1995 after six years in South Portland. Now Billy's has found a new home on Newbury Street in Portland. Fortunately for devotees of Uncle Billy's and barbecue, nothing has changed. The restaurant is still tiny. In one rectangular room are a bar (serving beer and wine only), dining room, kitchen and performance space. Here, too, are all the pig-related regalia of the old Southside place; fans have actually returned items that they bought when the place was closing. The decor is not the only thing that remains the same at Uncle Billy's. The food is still the same finger-licking, pig-out portions of yore. There are spareribs, pulled pork, chicken, sausages, steak, fish and all kinds of combinations of everything just mentioned ($6.45 to $19.95). This is a meat-eater's paradise.

Uncle Billy's is back. The original restaurant, Billy's Southside BBQ, closed in 1995 after six years in South Portland. Now Billy's has found a new home on Newbury Street in Portland.
Fortunately for devotees of Uncle Billy's and barbecue, nothing has changed. The restaurant is still tiny. In one rectangular room are a bar (serving beer and wine only), dining room, kitchen and performance space. Here, too, are all the pig-related regalia of the old Southside place; fans have actually returned items that they bought when the place was closing.
Large, papier-mache pigs greet you at the corner of the bar. Pig drawings by patrons on paper napkins pattern the walls. There are velvet paintings, images of Elvis and an alligator walking across the ceiling, which is painted black. A jukebox spins ancient tunes. Old television sets have been recycled and "broadcast" the specials. On the wall opposite the bar are two booths covered in zebra-patterned upholstery.
Six tables occupy the space between the twoareas. Uncle Billy's seats about 40, including bar stools.
The staff is as casual as the interior. The night I visited, they seemed disjointed and flip. One of the crew had called in, so they were shortstaffed and understandably suffering for it. But patrons, especially new faces, need friendly, continuous attention. That was missing from the visit, especially in the beginning. Service improved toward the end of the meal.
The decor is not the only thing that remains the same at Uncle Billy's. The food is still the same finger-licking, pig-out portions of yore. There are spareribs, pulled pork, chicken, sausages, steak, fish and all kinds of combinations of everything just mentioned ($6.45 to $19.95). This is a meat-eater's paradise.
There are some other choices too, including barbecue hash ($6.55/$7.45), Marquis de Lard's dirty rice ($5.60 regular/$7.45 large), gumbo ($6.55/$8.45) and barbecued spaghetti ($6.55/$7.45 with meat).
With menu in hand, we ordered a pound-producing meal. There are no appetizers; the quantity of the meals is so substantial, you don't need any. It didn't stop us.
We ordered Johnny's Cajun jambalaya as a starter ($6.55 regular/$8.45 large). This spicy concoction of sausage, chicken, shellfish, tomatoes, peppers, onions and celery lit a fire in our mouths. The rice was a bit mushy, but the flavor was wonderful.
Next to arrive were the pork spareribs - green cherry wood roasted with an undertone of hickory and oak charcoal ($8.45 for 3/4 pound, $10.45 for a full pound, $19.99 for two pounds). These large bones were flavorful, had a nicely charred surface and were sitting in a pool of Uncle Billy's own pungent barbecue sauce.
We also sampled the barbecued chicken ($6.95). The tender meat fell from the bone and was moist and succulent. The smoked flavor of the chicken was subtle and just right.
At Uncle Billy's, the meat is only part of the meal. All dinners are served with Billy's baked beans, German-style cole slaw, homemade cornbread and butter and pickles.
The corn bread is really something - thick and moist with a great mealy texture. It's so good I can't imagine using butter on it. The baked beans are a mild white variety. The cole slaw had caraway seed that been boiled in oil and celery seed - hence, the bow to its German roots. The pickles are sour as can be and fabulous.
We also ordered a side of fried sweet potatoes ($2). The thin slices were fried crisp and were delicious.
Finding room for dessert was a challenge. After studying the choices, I decided on the homemade key lime pie ($3.45). It was tart and tangy. The crust was a nice moist graham cracker variety. It was topped with whipped cream.
My companion ordered the "Death by Chocolate" ice cream sundae with roasted pecans. After the first spoonful, we understood how patrons become addicted to this confection.
Other desserts ($3.45 each) include sweet potato pie, Izzy's cheesecake of the day, and something called Chocolate Cold Medina, Love Potion Aphrodisiac, which is a raspberry mousse with chocolate sauce.
Our bill before tax, tip and drinks came to $44.
During the middle of our meal, the live music commenced. While the jukebox had been loud enough to be intrusive, the Irish/Scottish duet was so loud that we had to resort to shouting at each other over the table, and using hand signs and lip reading. The interesting part is that the twentysomething-and-younger crowd, who made up the lion's share of Uncle Billy's clientele, didn't even notice.

TOWNS OBJECT TO LEASING LAKE AS SHELLFISH FARM NEW MEADOWS LAKE SHOULD BE KEPT AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE PUBLIC USE, BATH AND BRUNSWICK SAY.

Author: Dennis Hoey Staff Writer

Abstract: Bath and Brunswick officials at a hearing Thursday strongly opposed two proposals to lease the bottom of New Meadows Lake for use as clam and oyster farms. Because the lake is polluted, the state Department of MarineResources has banned clam harvesting there.

Full text: Bath and Brunswick officials at a hearing Thursday strongly opposed two proposals to lease the bottom of New Meadows Lake for use as clam and oyster farms.
Because the lake is polluted, the state Department of MarineResources has banned clam harvesting there. However, Spinney Creek Shellfish Inc. of Eliot, and Andrew Johnson would be allowed to harvest clams because they have access to machinery that cleanses pollutants from the clams before they are sold.
West Bath selectmen and Brunswick town councilors oppose the proposals because Spinney Creek and Johnson are asking for exclusive rights to harvest clams in a 62-acre area of the lake for the next decade.
Local clammers say the manmade saltwater lake could be clean enough for commercial shellfish harvesting within months and the proposals would freeze them out.
"We will show you that this area is poised to be an open (clam digging) area. We believe, in the strongest possible terms, that this area should one day be made available to the public," said Geoffrey Hole, Brunswick's town attorney.
The applicants, who have presented separate proposals to the Department of Marine Resources, want to lease 62 acres of the upper lake, which is between Route 1 and Old Bath Road, between West Bath and Brunswick.
Each proposal calls for planting and harvesting American oysters and quahogs, which are hard-shelled clams.
Spinney Creek Shellfish is owned by Thomas and Lori Howell. The lower part of New Meadows Lake, between Route 1 and Bath Road, is currently open to shellfish harvesting.
Laurice Churchill, who moderated Thursday's hearing for the state, said she has up to four months to make a recommendation. Lewis Flagg, acting commissioner of the Department of Marine Resources, will consider her recommendation before approving or rejecting the applications.
More than 60 people, many of them clam diggers from West Bath and Brunswick, came to Thursday's courtroom-style hearing to speak against the proposals. Each town brought its attorney, and a representative from the state Attorney General's Office was present.
The consensus of the crowd was that the lake is getting cleaner and could be open to the public for clam digging within a few months.
The state had closed New Meadows Lake since the 1950s because of pollution from two overboard discharge systems at the northeast corner of the lake and other, undetected sources of pollution.
But last September, the state gave Spinney Creek Shellfish permission to rake clams from boats in the upper lake - the lake's average depth is 5 feet - because Spinney Creek is certified to take clams from polluted areas.
The York County-based company operates a clam depuration or cleansing facility. The state allows Spinney Creek to pump contaminants out of clams before selling them to retailers and restaurants.
Spinney Creek wants to plant clam and oyster seeds on 32 acres of the bottom of upper New Meadows Lake. Johnson would use another 30 acres.
Alan Houston, Brunswick's natural resources planner and a former shellfish warden, said recent tests show that the upper lake's water quality has improved within the last six months. He could not explain why the improvement has occurred, as no special cleansing measures have been taken.
However, when asked if the upper lake could be reopened to shellfish harvesting, Paul Anderson, director of DMR's Public Health Division, said it could be reopened eventually, but he added, "I don't think it's imminent." "We believe, in the strongest possible terms, that this area should one day be made available to the public." Geoffrey Hole, Brunswick town attorney

Abstract: Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe and a panel of marine scientists urged aggressive research Wednesday into the growing threat of poisonous algae and killer microbes in the nation's oceans. Snowe wants Congress to spend $32 million a year, more than double the current level, to study and fight outbreaks of red tide and other toxic algae and microbes such as pfiesteria. The unexplained invasions kill fish and other marine animals and can sicken or kill people who eat poisoned seafood. "In my state of Maine," Snowe said, "paralytic shellfish poisoning requires the closure of clam flats along the coast each year, costing Maine millions of dollars in lost economic opportunity. More seriously, (it) can be deadly to human beings if the toxins are ingested."

Full text: Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe and a panel of marine scientists urged aggressive research Wednesday into the growing threat of poisonous algae and killer microbes in the nation's oceans.
Snowe wants Congress to spend $32 million a year, more than double the current level, to study and fight outbreaks of red tide and other toxic algae and microbes such as pfiesteria. The unexplained invasions kill fish and other marine animals and can sicken or kill people who eat poisoned seafood.
On Wednesday, Snowe led a three-hour hearing of the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries in Washington, D.C., and heard warnings from ocean scientists around the country.
The national focus came less than one week after Maine's Department of Marine Resources detected the first bloom of red tide this year.
The state has declared it illegal to collect mussels and carnivorous snails from New Hampshire to Cape Elizabeth and Harpswell to Phippsburg because they may be dangerous to eat. The closure remains in effect and officials are now testing clams to see if toxin levels are high enough to ban clamming as well.
"In my state of Maine," Snowe said, "paralytic shellfish poisoning requires the closure of clam flats along the coast each year, costing Maine millions of dollars in lost economic opportunity. More seriously, (it) can be deadly to human beings if the toxins are ingested."
An outbreak of pfiesteria caused a massive fish kill in the Chesapeake Bay last year and was blamed for health problems in people who came in contact with the organism.
"The conditions may be favorable for another (pfiesteria) outbreak," Terry Garcia, assistant commerce secretary for oceans and atmosphere, warned the Senate subcommittee.
The pfiesteria eruption, still not entirely understood, focused attention on harmful algal blooms which have dramatically increased during the last 25 years.
"It's a national problem . . . and the impact on the economy is staggering and it is not being addressed," said Garcia.
In addition to the health threat, damage from the microscopic killers is estimated to cost the fishing industry $35 million to $65 million a year. Contamination also takes a toll on the tourist industry.
While unpredictable and largely unexplained, the outbreaks have been linked to pollution, ocean warming and storms and ocean currents. Ships may contribute to the problem by carrying organisms to new areas.
Improvements in science have made it possible to detect threats that may have existed for a long time, but the phenomenon also is clearly increasing, testified Donald M. Anderson, senior scientist atWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
"It's big and it's growing, and that trend is all the more worrisome in light of rapid population growth in the coastal zones of the country and our heavy dependence on near-shore waters for economics, nutrition and recreation," Anderson said in prepared testimony.
Anderson listed major outbreaks of toxic algae that struck along the coast of New Jersey, Long Island and Rhode Island in 1985, North Carolina in 1987, the west coast in 1991 and Texas last year.
Algae blooms can be destructive even when they're not toxic. Scientists on Wednesday described how the die-off of a huge algae bloom in the Gulf of Mexico off Louisiana has created a 7,000-square-mile dead zone without oxygen to sustain sea life.
Snowe and Sen. John Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, are cosponsors of a $32-million-a-year bill. It would boost a core research program by $10.5 million a year, finance other studies and grants to states, and coordinate national response to outbreaks.
The bill, which may be expanded based on testimony during the hearing, could go before Congress this summer.
"Even more troubling than the general trend is that science cannot fully explain why this is happening or how to prevent it in the future," Snowe said. "Nor do we know how to eliminate a bloom once it occurs."
Maine has been monitoring red tide outbreaks since 1958 and frequently closes part of the coast to the harvesting of shellfish that accummulate the toxins in their flesh.
Mussels are especially sensitive and are the first to show levels of the poison called saxitoxin, said John Hurst, who tests shellfish for the state.
On May 14, the state issued a mussel and carnivorous snail closing from Two Lights in Cape Elizabeth to the New Hampshire border. On May 15, the red tide closure was expanded to include the area between Basin Point in Harpswell and Fort Popham in Phippsburg.
Eating a contaminated shellfish first causes lips and extremities such as fingers and toes to tingle. If nothing is done to control the spread of the poison, it can kill a person by paralyzing the brain's signals that tell the lungs to breathe, Hurst said.
Maine has enjoyed several summers with little sign of red tide. But contamination showed up early this year, perhaps because of higher-than-usual ocean temperatures, according to Hurst. No one can be sure how long the latest outbreak will last.
"We had a rest in 1996 and 1997," he said, "but it doesn't look like we're going to have a rest this year." ____________________________________________________________________ __

Abstract: Roy Jackson has itchy red bumps in an armpit and on an elbow. He expects to have a lot more places to scratch soon as the caterpillarseason on Great Chebeague Island progresses. Jackson, and others like him who react to hairs shed by the bugs, hope an aerial attack against browntail moth caterpillars will help keep rashes to a minimum this summer. In all, about 3,000 acres will be sprayed from the air with Dimilin, said Dick Bradbury, an entomologist with the state forest service. Much of the aerial spraying will occur between Route 88 and the water.

Full text: Roy Jackson has itchy red bumps in an armpit and on an elbow. He expects to have a lot more places to scratch soon as the caterpillarseason on Great Chebeague Island progresses.
"It's a wicked itch," he says. "Just like poison ivy."
Jackson, and others like him who react to hairs shed by the bugs, hope an aerial attack against browntail moth caterpillars will help keep rashes to a minimum this summer.
Spraying of the moths is expected to begin today in Falmouth and continue through several other communities, including Yarmouth, Cumberland Foreside and Chebeague Island, during the next few days.
In all, about 3,000 acres will be sprayed from the air with Dimilin, said Dick Bradbury, an entomologist with the state forest service. Much of the aerial spraying will occur between Route 88 and the water.
Another 1,500 to 3,000 acres will be sprayed on the ground using a variety of compounds, he said. That spraying is already under way.
Costs of ground and air attacks could reach $150,000 or more, Bradbury said. Communities and individual land owners will pay the bill, he said.
Dimilin is a petroleum productthat has caused controversy because it can damage the shells of lobsters, clams and other shellfish. Spraying is prohibited within 100 feet of the shoreline.
Some people have requested that their land not be sprayed by air. In Yarmouth, for example, four people have requested that their property not be sprayed, said Marcia Noyes, the town's community services director.
But that number is down from the eight people who originally declined, she said. Four of them changed their minds.
Bradbury said Dimilin does not pose a threat to people, but he advised folks to go indoors if they see the spray plane coming. Bradbury also said it would be best to keep children inside until the grass and foliage are dry.
The spraying generally takes place between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m., before the winds pick up, he said.
Dimilin kills the caterpillars by interfering with the biological processes that harden their shells so they can molt, Bradbury said. Dimilin prevents the shells from hardening. Eventually, so much pressure builds up inside the caterpillars that they burst.
"It's kind of gruesome," Bradbury said. And effective, with kill rates up to 99 percent, he said.
The spraying kills the caterpillars before they develop the hairs that cause rashes and respiratory problems for people.
The tiny hairs pose a hazard when they become airborne and are inhaled or land on people's skin. The hairs carry toxins, which probably help protect them from being eaten by birds, Bradbury said.
Jackson said hedoes a lot of outdoor work on the island, cutting trees and clearing land. Invariably he begins itching when working in the trees.
The hairs cause "red welts that stick up quite a bit," said Jackson, who uses a variety of creams to stop the itching and has even had to use antibiotics.
Jackson advised people who are affected by the caterpillar hairs to take a shower as soon as the itching starts and to put on clean clothes.
Even though the spray campaign is expected to be successful, Bradbury expects the caterpillars to be back next year in even larger numbers.
That's because only a small portion of 50,000 acres infested statewide is being sprayed. Plus, each female caterpillar can produce 400 eggs.
"We're strictly trying to protect people with the spray," Bradbury said. "If you look at an insect that can produce 400 offspring, you can't even consider eradication."
The caterpillar infestation has been steadily marching up the coast over the past several years, he said. Infestations of the caterpillar generally run in 10-year cycles, Bradbury said. This cycle started around 1991.
BROWNTAIL MOTH
The moth came to the United States from Europe in a boat that docked near Boston in 1897.
It is most prevalant on Cape Cod and around Casco Bay.
The moth's caterpillar is brown and hairy, 1.5 inches long, with white stripes running down both sides and two red spots on its back.
The caterpillar carries a toxin on its hairs that causes skin rashes.
The caterpillar is active from April to June.
The moth comes out in July and is white with golden brown hairs.
The moth hair also carries the toxin.
To avoid the hairs, use caution in brushy or wooded areas, don't hang wash outside, and avoid caterpillar webs. Change clothes if exposure occurs. "It's a wicked itch. Just like poison ivy." Roy Jackson of Great Chebeague Island

Abstract: U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine charged Monday that federal officials do a poor job inspecting imported fruits and vegetables. Lax inspections, she said, are causing "a serious and growing public health problem in America." Collins said she was troubled that government inspections of imported fruits and vegetables have decreased by almost 50 percent over the last six years, even though American consumers are buying more imported food products. More than one-third of all fresh fruit and 12 percent of vegetables consumed in the United States are grown outside the country. As head of the Senate subcommittee on investigations, Collins asked her staff nearly a year ago to examine thesafety of imported foods. She said she was prompted to conduct the study after people in Maine became ill from imported strawberries and raspberries.

Full text: U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine charged Monday that federal officials do a poor job inspecting imported fruits and vegetables. Lax inspections, she said, are causing "a serious and growing public health problem in America."
A new government report released by Collins concluded that federal programs to ensure the safety of imported foods are outdated, inconsistent and unreliable.
Collins said she was troubled that government inspections of imported fruits and vegetables have decreased by almost 50 percent over the last six years, even though American consumers are buying more imported food products. More than one-third of all fresh fruit and 12 percent of vegetables consumed in the United States are grown outside the country.
The government report, Collins said, "represents a serious indictment of standard practices used by the Food and Drug Administration," the agency charged with inspecting fruits and vegetables.
As head of the Senate subcommittee on investigations, Collins asked her staff nearly a year ago to examine thesafety of imported foods. She said she was prompted to conduct the study after people in Maine became ill from imported strawberries and raspberries.
Collins asked the government's General Accounting Office to examine the issue as well. She released the GAO findings Monday.
According to the GAO report, 81 million cases of food-borne illnesses occur each year, resulting in more than 9,000 deaths. The national Centers for Disease Control report that thousands of those cases involve people sickened bypathogens in fruits and vegetables grown abroad. Officials do not have a precise figure on the number of illnesses or deaths caused by imported foods.
In 1997, more than 200 children and teachers in Michigan developed hepatitis after eating frozen strawberries that were imported from Mexico. Those strawberries also contributed to 29 cases of hepatitis in Maine, according to Dr. Kathleen F. Gensheimer, the state epidemiologist.
The Maine cases of hepatitis were "very, very serious," Gensheimer said. One person was a candidate for a liver transplant but was able to recover.
Collins also noted that 2,000 Americans, including five people in Maine, became sick after eating Guatemalan raspberries in the last two years.
The GAO has recommended that the United States stop importing foods from nations that do not meet U.S. health and safety standards. But that proposal will likely face opposition from countries that view increased regulation as a free-trade issue.
Collins did not immediately embrace the GAO's recommendation, but said "we should look at that."
Currently, the Agriculture Department requires that countries that export meat and poultry to the United States have food safety standards comparable to American standards. However, the FDA does not have the same requirement for vegetables, fruits, grains, fish and other foods.
At a news conference Monday, Collins said she didn't want to alarm the public. Most imported fruit and vegetables are fine, she said, but "we have an obligation to look at the system and fix it."
Specifically, she said she was concerned that less than 2 percent of imported fruits and vegetables are inspected, compared to 8 percent in 1992.
She also raised questions about the inspection process. She said importers are allowed to keep custody of their food during inspections, and that importers decide which samples will be inspected and where the fruits and vegetables will be inspected.
Gensheimer said she's glad to see Collins' committee focus on the food safety issue.
Although food safety may seem like a noncontroversial issue, Gensheimer said, the matter is complicated because countries have differing standards. Changing food safety standards could have repercussions on free trade agreements, and on the cost and availability of imported fruit and vegetables. It may also require that the government spend more money trying to protect the safety of the food supply. It now spends about $1 billion.
"The whole issue is very, very complex. There's not an easy fix," Gensheimer said.
Even at Collins' news conference, representatives of the Grocery Manufacturers of America distributed statements opposing increased regulatory powers for the FDA. The group, which represents food and beverage companies, argues that it would be too expensive and wouldn't accomplish anything to send U.S. inspectors overseas.
"We think we can do a more effective job catching (any tainted fruits and vegetables) at the border," said Anna Matz, a spokeswoman for thegroup.
On Thursday, Collins will hold her first hearing on food safety. It will feature, among others, Mary Ellen Camire, an associate professor and chairman of the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Maine.
In prepared testimony, Camire says that food-borne illnesses from imported as well as domestic foods will increase unless the government intervenes.
"We must act to protect all Americans from preventable illnesses," Camire is expected to tell the Senate panel. "As a resident of a rural state that relies heavily on imported foods, I feel that this is the time for corrective action to occur."

SAFETY GAPS
Some of the gaps in the imported-food safety system found by the General Accounting Office:
The Food and Drug Admini- stration is able to inspect only 1.7 percent of 2.7 million shipments of fruit, vegetables, seafood and processed foods under its jurisdiction.
Of the shipments that were inspected by FDA, only 16,000 samples underwent a labora- tory analysis for disease-causing organisms or other problems.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's food inspection service focuses too much on violations such as missing shipping labels that "bear little relationship to food safety."
Importers, not the FDA, choose which laboratories do sampling when a shipment is held up over safety questions.
Importers often retain control of shipments even if the FDA decides to inspect them and, in some cases, goes ahead and markets them anyway because penalties are extremely low.
FOOD IMPORTS
A General Accounting Office study found that:
Americans ate more than $33 billion in imported foods in 1996, an increase of almost 50 percent over 1990.
More than half of all fish and shellfish eaten by Americans is now imported.
At least one-third of fresh fruit and 12 percent of vegetables also come from overseas.

Abstract: Spinney Creek Shellfish Inc. of Eliot, which won the federal grant, this month begins raising baby clams in its hatchery. Once the microscopic larvae grow to 1.25 inches long, the clams will be transplanted from Eliot to a state-licensed site in the New Meadows River in West Bath and nursed to adulthood. Though clam farming isn't new to Maine, the Agriculture Department agreed to fund this project because it will help explore methods of boosting the number of clams harvested through aquaculture, said Dr. Brian Beal, assistant professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. Now, Spinney Creek is in a unique position to raise steamers. It is the only company in Maine certified to cultivate clams from areas closed to clam harvesting, such as the New Meadows River near Bath. Spinney is allowed to purify and sell them after they've grown to a certain size.

Full text: Maine's efforts to bring back steamers - succulent delicacies that have been affected by years of shorefront pollution - could get a boost from a new, federally financed program to raise clams by hand.
The key to restoring the state's famous soft-shelled clam, the Mya arenaria, is a $60,000 aquaculture program financed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Spinney Creek Shellfish Inc. of Eliot, which won the federal grant, this month begins raising baby clams in its hatchery. Once the microscopic larvae grow to 1.25 inches long, the clams will be transplanted from Eliot to a state-licensed site in the New Meadows River in West Bath and nursed to adulthood.
Though clam farming isn't new to Maine, the Agriculture Department agreed to fund this project because it will help explore methods of boosting the number of clams harvested through aquaculture, said Dr. Brian Beal, assistant professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias.
Maine has a lot riding on this and other experiments with aquaculture - from salmon farming up north to clam farming in York County.
However, some experts question how successful aquaculture will be in the United States. And critics say some types of aquaculture create problems of their own, including pollution problems.
"Globally, aquaculture is a way of life for many cultures," Beal said. "But whether it becomes a way of life in the Northeast has yet to be seen. Salmon aquaculture has led the way so far."
The aquaculture industry in Maine so far has been geared toward home-grown salmon and oysters.
Clam farming is much less widespread, largely because of the persistent pollution of the state's clam flats, according to Jon Lewis, the state's aquaculture chief. Clam flats are needed when the clams pass the larvae stage, and are ready to mature.
Now, Spinney Creek is in a unique position to raise steamers. It is the only company in Maine certified to cultivate clams from areas closed to clam harvesting, such as the New Meadows River near Bath. Spinney is allowed to purify and sell them after they've grown to a certain size.
The federal Small Business Innovation Research Grant awarded to Spinney Creek Shellfish - the first such grant issued in Maine - is aimed at developing large-scale production of home-grown clams.
The grant is designed to increase the state's clam production beyond just Spinney Creek's operation - to the point where it becomes self-sustaining, said U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
"The hope is, through a relatively small federal investment, a larger industry can spring up," she said.
Spinney Creek officials had to go through a rigorous application process to show that the project is a good risk.
Ken LaValley, the company's manager, said the home-grown clams "will help take the pressure off the natural soft-shelled clam populations, which have been decreasing."
The key to artifically raised shellfish is they could be harvested year-round, whenever they mature, he said.
Here is a look at the maturation process: After clams spawn, their larvae remain floating in water for two to three weeks, then go through a metamorphosis, becoming what is commonly called a "steamer," and dropping to the ocean floor.
"They settle in certain areas of the flats, depending on the current," LaValley explained. "So if you can make an area more attractive by furrowing the flat, roughing it, turning it, or putting a panel of mesh or snow fencing or pine boughs and causing a water disturbance as the tide comes in and out, it forces these animals down into the sediment, makes it more appealing for them."
Indeed, the juvenile clams that Spinney will use after they reach 1.25 inches in length will be taken to the New Meadows River. There, they will be placed under protective netting, which will be put on foam floats. The system is designed to slow the tidal movements while the clams are maturing.
That is how the most fertile clam beds are - they are characterized by slow, aerated water movement. This way, small clams can dig deeper into the sand and they can find protection during development, explained Beal, of the University of Maine at Machias.
Spinney, however, has its critics. Spinney is certified in Maine as a depuration, or cleansing, facility. As such, the company is allowed to harvest clams from some polluted clam flats, pumpthe contaminants out of the clams and sell the cleaned product to retailers and restaurants.
Spinney Creek's commercial clam-harvesting efforts are sometimes resented by local clammers who have been barred from digging in polluted areas - the very spots where only Spinney Creek is allowed to dig.
As an example, when clam flats reopened in Ogunquit last year, recreational diggers complained that Spinney's diggers already had taken the big clams from the area.
LaValley said over the long term hiscompany actually makes clam flats more productive.
"There's a lot of misunderstanding with a lot of towns perceiving us as monsters exhausting the resource wherever we want to go, but it's not true," LaValley said. "By managing a shellfish flat, we're helping make it more productive."
Some experts remain skeptical about Spinney's new plan for clam aquaculture.
Aquaculture is still a new art, some experts say. People in the aquaculture industry have to develop innovative methods of increasing what they raise, but the industry also must figure out how to control disease and pollution in hatcheries and farms.
"Many people believe aquaculture is the solution to today's overfishing crisis," said Boyce Thorne-Miller, senior scientist at SeaWeb, a marine conservation arm of the Pew Charitable Trusts in Washington. "It is not a panacea."
When the University of Maine sponsored a forum in Eastport last month - the New England Farmed Fish Health Workshop - a main topic of discussion was a deadly viral disease that was spreading among salmon-fish farms. Some speakers said salmon anemia threatens a significant part of Maine's $60 million aquaculture industry.
Now that Spinney Creek has received the federal funding for clam farming, Thorne-Miller questioned the risk inherent in the process: To what extent should the public finance an unproven science?
Thorne-Miller said that coastal residents "generally aren't pleased about aquaculture facilities because they're not attractive to look atand pollution from the facility itself can be problematic to the ecosystem."
However, Paul Anderson, Maine's top public health official in the Marine Resources Department, said he believes Maine has been adequately cautious in its oversight of the aquaculture industry.
"If we watch ourselves, hopefully we can learn from others' mistakes and limit any adversity," Anderson said.
SPINNEY CREEK PROJECT
The shellfish company has been awarded the state's first Small Business Innovation Research grant from the U.S. government. Spinney will raise soft-shelled clams, commonly known as steamers.
The $60,000 grant is designed to increase clam production in Maine beyond what Spinney Creek harvests - to the point when clam flats around the state become self-sustaining.
Spinney Creek plans to raise clams from larvae in its hatchery, then transplant them to a state-licensed clam flat area in the New Meadows River in West Bath, where they will be nursed to adulthood.
The company will experiment by using nets to help the juvenile clams mature, in addition to furrowing the sand to slow the tides. Both procedures promote aeration of the flat, making it easier for the clams to burrow.

Abstract: By tackling big pollution problems head-on - sources such as paper mills, sewage treatment plants and industry - rivers and harbors all across Maine have been transformed from veritable toxic stews to playgrounds. The improvements are especially obvious in southern Maine. Once an open sewer that some likened to "a root beer float," Portland Harbor is now flourishing with kayakers, sailors and some fishermen. Once so toxic it peeled the paint off people's houses, the Androscoggin River is now a magnet for canoeists, hundreds of whom participate in the annual 175-mile "Source to the Sea" canoe trek. THE CHALLENGE today is ubiquitous and diffuse sources of pollution - urban and agricultural runoff, faulty stormdrains, illegal discharges and failing septic systems. These nonpoint pollutants are a problem all over Maine, contributing to shellfish bed closures in the bays, algal blooms in the lakes and oxygen depletion in brooks and rivers.

Full text: ABOUT THE AUTHOR John P. DeVillars is administrator of the New England office of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
The first 25 years of environmental protection in this country has yielded enormous dividends for waters in the state of Maine.
By tackling big pollution problems head-on - sources such as paper mills, sewage treatment plants and industry - rivers and harbors all across Maine have been transformed from veritable toxic stews to playgrounds.
The improvements are especially obvious in southern Maine. Once an open sewer that some likened to "a root beer float," Portland Harbor is now flourishing with kayakers, sailors and some fishermen. Once so toxic it peeled the paint off people's houses, the Androscoggin River is now a magnet for canoeists, hundreds of whom participate in the annual 175-mile "Source to the Sea" canoe trek.
For all the success stories, though, Maine faces daunting challenges cleaning up its rivers, lakes and bays. Those tasks are dramatically different than they were 25 years ago, when most of our attention was focused on point sources of pollution such as sewage plants and paper mills.
THE CHALLENGE today is ubiquitous and diffuse sources of pollution - urban and agricultural runoff, faulty stormdrains, illegal discharges and failing septic systems. These nonpoint pollutants are a problem all over Maine, contributing to shellfish bed closures in the bays, algal blooms in the lakes and oxygen depletion in brooks and rivers.
Earlier this year, Vice President Al Gore unveiled a new Clean Water Action Plan for tackling the nation's most pressing water pollution problems.
It emphasizes new strategies that encourage collaboration and cooperation, regulatory flexibility and creative use of innovative technologies.
Coordinating with other federal agencies, state and local governments and citizen groups, we are focusing these strategies on specific watersheds that have been selected due to their ecological or recreational value or proximity to urban areas. Among the areas being targeted is the Casco Bay watershed, a resource that encompasses 41 communities (including Portland) and includes some of the state's most valuable fishing grounds and recreational areas.
AMONG THE most immediate priorities are two of the watershed's primary tributaries, the Royal River, which flows into Casco Bay in Yarmouth, and Capisic Brook, which flows into the Fore River upstream of Portland Harbor.
The challenge in the Royal River is to clean up the western tributaries so that they can support a healthy native trout fishery. The trout habitat in many of these brooks is degraded and some cannot support trout because of sedimentation and oxygen-depletion problems caused by storm runoff and eroded embankments.
With EPA assistance, the Cumberland County Soil and Water Conservation District recently identified 11 sites that are degrading the trout habitat in Brandy Brook, one of the western tributaries. The district is launching a program to replant sections of the brook and make necessary structural improvements. By fall 1999, we hope to start seeing tangible results, as trout return.
Capisic Brook has been seriously compromised by urban runoff from combined sewer overflows and contaminated stormwater. The EPA and Maine's Department of Environmental Protection are working closely with city officials and neighborhood groups to create an urban "greenbelt" along the brook's corridor that will serve as a foundation for restoring its water quality.
THE CORNERSTONE of the project, to be done within the next three to five years, is the design and construction of a series of ponds in Capisic Pond Park that will store and treat contaminated stormwater and also enhance wildlife habitat. We are confident this project will serve as a model for simultaneously addressing sewer overflow and stormwater problems.
A third project we're pursuing in the Casco Bay watershed is an initiative focusing on the bay's $5.9 million shellfishing industry, whose growth is limited by bacterial contamination from various pollution sources, natural predation by green crabs and some overfishing.
Recently the Casco Bay Estuary Project and the University of Southern Maine received a $185,000 sustainable development grant to tackle bacterial contamination problems in the bay and formulate plans for achieving sustainable harvests.
The project, which will be carried out by a diverse coalition of partners, including shellfishermen, is expected to expand areas that are open to shellfishing, resulting in an estimated increasing in landings of up to 25 percent.
While none of these improvements will come cheaply, the costs will easily be outweighed by the economic benefits of a cleaner neighborhood, a cleaner bay and a healthier shellfishing industry.

Full text: The Casco Bay Estuary Project has received a $185,000 federal grant to restore clam flats in Casco Bay.
The organization's efforts to clean up polluted shellfish beds and reopen them to clam diggers is one of six economic development projects selected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in New England. The Sustainable Development Grants announced on Friday total $672,050.
Katherine Groves, director of the Estuary Project, said the money will help open clam flats in the bay and even around Portland islands. The organization is working to eliminate pollution sources and plan for sustainable shellfish harvests.
John P. DeVillars, the EPA's NewEngland administrator, said the Casco Bay project will be a model for growth that doesn't undermine natural resources.
Projects in other New England states that received grants included studies of tax policies and development sprawl, alternative land-use regulations and forestry management.

Full text: Joan E. Herzog is a nutrition consultant and owner of Nutrition Solutions, Inc.
There has been a 20-fold increase in the number of asthma diagnoses in the past century.
One in 15 people has asthma, making it the sixth most commonly diagnosed condition in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Hippocrates, a physician publication, reports that 25 percent of the U.S. population suffers from allergies, asthma or both.
Twenty-four million work and school days are lost each year because of asthma, and the cost of this health care has skyrocketed to more than $8 billion annually.
According to a reference guide by the American Board of Family Practice, asthma generally appears between ages 3 and 43.
Exercise, stress and the weather can set off a series of asthmatic reactions - wheezing, coughing and struggling for a full breath. Other symptoms may be more vague, making diagnosis difficult - chest congestion, shortness of breath, flu-like chest pain or a lingering, dry throat tickle.
Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the lung airways made worse by bronchial spasms. More than 60 percent of asthma sufferers also have allergies. In most cases, it is thought the asthma is caused by the body's allergy-mediated response to substances such as cigarette smoke, dust mites, industrial chemicals and food.
Dr. David Rosenstreich of Albert Einstein College in New York City found twice the rate of severe cases of childhood asthma in the country's poorest neighborhoods. The National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study reported a cause to be strong allergic reactions to a common problem - cockroach droppings.
Proper medical treatment of asthma can make a world of difference. Many people suffer needlessly. Failure to diagnose and treat it can lead to permanent lung damage. There is no known cure for asthma, but it can be controlled, by avoiding triggers and taking medications as directed.
Common asthma treatments include:
Avoiding known asthmatic triggers: cigarettes, pets, pollens and allergenic foods.
Brochodilators, which relax airway muscles, making it easier to breathe.
Corticosteriods, which reduce airway inflammation and improve lung function.
Some newer asthma medications help by preventing allergic reactions. Others block mucous production.
Stress reduction and relaxation training can help reduce frequency and severity of attacks in some people.
I have noted an increase of patients seeking treatment because of suspected food allergies. Common foods that may cause respiratory symptoms include wheat, nuts, eggs, shellfish, milk, infant formula and soybeans. It can be difficult to discoverthe exact causes. A tedious food elimination diet protocol is often necessary for diagnosis.
Physicians have also found it easier to control the disease when a person is not carrying extra weight.
The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has new guidelines for physicians. Here are some of them:
Persistent asthma should be controlled with daily anti-inflammatory medications.
Asthma should be classified (mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent) and treated accordingly.
Allergy testing should be used to identify indoor allergens.
Asthma may be prevented by reducing exposure to allergens and tobacco smoke.
Allergists agree the smoking epidemic that hit our country after World War II is behind a large percentage of asthma and allergy cases. Giving up smoking may be the most important action to prevent asthma. At the very least, avoid exposing your children to cigarettes, pipes and cigars.

Full text: The caterpillars that have brought misery to residents around Casco Bay are expected to march farther up the coast and inland this year than they have in any year this decade.
Coastal towns are gearing up for an infestation of browntail moth caterpillars, with plans to spray pesticide from planes, trucks and hand-held cans.
The caterpillars began munching leaves earlier than normal this spring and the spraying likely will not come in time to prevent extensive defoliation. But it should kill the insects before their toxic hairs become airborne.
That is critical to people who develop respiratory problems when they inhale the hairs or break out in rashes when the hairs touch their skin.
"People should remain calm," said Dick Bradbury, an entomologist with the state forest service. "In almost all cases we'll destroy the insects before they become a serious problem."
John Scott hopes Bradbury is right. Scott spends summers with his wife on Great Cheabeague Island, one of the areas hardest hit by the caterpillars. He is allergic to the hairs, and his reaction last summer was his worst ever.
"It's like having a very bad case of the measles that goes on and on," Scott said. "It's very, very uncomfortable and you can't do anything about it but stay inside. It's wicked."
The caterpillar population has been on the rise since 1990. It typically follows a cycle in which the population increases for about 10 years and then crashes. The caterpillars are expected to be especially abundant this year because of the warm winter and spring.
Bradbury said the caterpillars ended their dormant stage and began munching budding leaves April 9, about two weeks earlier than in past years.
Casco Bay is the only area in the state where severe infestations have occurred. In most years, only a few islands have been affected. This year, the infestation is expected to hit the islands and all the towns along the coast between Falmouth and Harpswell.
The towns of Cumberland and Yarmouth are planning for the first time to pay for aerial spraying. Residents aggravated by the caterpillars last year demanded the programs.
Carla Nixon, Cumberland's assistant town manager, fields about 10 calls a day from people requesting that the town spray their land.
"It's the biggest issue the town has faced in a while," Nixon said. "People who have suffered in the past are desperate for relief."
Tonight, the Cumberland Town Council will vote on spending $39,500 to have a plane spray more than 1,500 acres of Chebeague Island and Cumberland Foreside.
The Yarmouth Town Council has budgeted $26,000 to spray about 1,000 acres on Cousins Island, some other coastal areas, and a stretch of Route 88.
Portland also will do some aerial spraying, and Falmouth is helping to coordinate aerial spraying programs that will be funded by the affected neighborhoods.
The planes spray dimilin, a petroleum product that has generated controversy because it can damage the shells of lobsters, clams and other shellfish. Spraying is prohibited within 100 feetof the shoreline.
Bradbury said the chemical does not pose a threat to people, though in Cumberland nine people have asked that their properties not be sprayed.
Brunswick plans to have trucks spray about 200 acres on Mere Point with a bacteria called Bt.
Bradbury said Bt does not kill the moths as effectively as dimilin, but it poses no threat to lobsters or shellfish.
All of the spraying will take place in May. By then, the caterpillars will have munched a lot of leaves, but will not have produced the toxin that drives people crazy.
"I lost half my summer last year," Scott said. "I hope that doesn't happen again this year." BROWNTAIL MOTH
The moth came to the United States from Europe in a boat that docked near Boston in 1897.
It is most prevalant on Cape Cod and around Casco Bay.
The moth's caterpillar is brown and hairy, 1.5 inches long, with white stripes running down both sides and two red spots on its back.
The caterpillar carries a toxin on its hairs that causes skin rashes.
The caterpillar is active from April to June.
The moth comes out in July and is white with golden brown hairs.
The moth hair also carries the toxin.
To avoid the hairs, use caution in brushy or wooded areas, don't hang wash outside, and avoid caterpillar webs. Change clothes if exposure occurs.

Abstract: Open for six months, the new space has been enlarged three times already. The interior is simple yet cozy. A wood-burning stove in the front room cast a warm glow the rainy night we visited. Natural wood has been used as wainscoting on the lower half of the walls. The upper half is wallpapered in a rural Italian scene. Our inexperienced but sincere server brought us an outstanding small, round loaf of Pompeo's homemade bread. It was served warm with a good-quality olive oil that was flecked with red and black pepper. We devoured it while we made our selections, keeping in mind that soup and salad come with the entrees. For an appetizer, I ordered the mussels steamed in white wine, garlic and essences ($4.95). My companion ordered the sauteed oyster mushrooms ($4.95). We put in our soup, salad and entree orders at the same time. Unfortunately, the soup and salads arrived before the appetizers.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
There's a soft spot in my heart for neighborhood restaurants. They're so homey and convenient and familiar. They become part of the history and tradition of a neighborhood, a place whereyou go to share joys and sorrows with friends and family over a good meal.
In Portland's Deering Center, there's a new addition to an existing neighborhood restaurant. And even if that's not your neighborhood, you'll soon feel as if you're right at home.
Pompeo's Brick Oven Pizza has been turning out delicious pizzas and excellent homemade bread for three years. Now, owner Joe Pompeo has expanded into the rear of the building and is serving dinners five nights a week at Pompeo's Ristorante.
Open for six months, the new space has been enlarged three times already. The interior is simple yet cozy. A wood-burning stove in the front room cast a warm glow the rainy night we visited. Natural wood has been used as wainscoting on the lower half of the walls. The upper half is wallpapered in a rural Italian scene.
There are three dining areas and a small room with a bar. Smoking is not allowed at Pompeo's.
The menu, which changes daily, is limited but growing. On our visit, there were threeappetizers ($4.95 to $5.95), three soups and stews ($3.95 to $6.95), four entrees ($10.95 to $13.95), several specials and all the offerings of the menu from the pizza parlor up front. It includes three salads ($4.95 to $7.95), seven Italian entrees ($7.95 to $9.95), calzones ($5.95 and up), and specialty and custom pizzas ($5.45 to $13.50 and up).
Pompeo's has a small but choice wine list, with selections available by the glass ($3 to $4.95) and bottle ($12 to $19.95).
Our inexperienced but sincere server brought us an outstanding small, round loaf of Pompeo's homemade bread. It was served warm with a good-quality olive oil that was flecked with red and black pepper. We devoured it while we made our selections, keeping in mind that soup and salad come with the entrees.
For an appetizer, I ordered the mussels steamed in white wine, garlic and essences ($4.95). My companion ordered the sauteed oyster mushrooms ($4.95). We put in our soup, salad and entree orders at the same time. Unfortunately, the soup and salads arrived before the appetizers.
My mussels were abundant; almost two dozen arrived on the oversized platter. They were awash in a fragrant bath of white wine, garlic and fresh parsley. The mussels were large, tender and very good.
My companion's oyster mushrooms were outstanding. A generous portion of mushrooms had been sauteed in butter, garlic and sweet vermouth. The flavor was delicate and mouthwatering.
My companion and I shared a crock of onion soup, a hearty version full of onions, with a thick slice of bread floating on top. It was crowned with a thick layer of cheese and broiled to bubbling brown perfection. We enjoyed it but knew we had to hold back. There was still so much more to come.
Other soup offerings that evening were cream of chicken, rice and romano (each $3.95), and lobster stew ($6.95).
The house salads were basic but fresh and attractive. They consisted of romaine lettuce, tomato, red onion, green pepper and cucumber. There is one homemade dressing offered, a white zinfindel. Other pre-made choices are available too.
My entree, delmonico steak ($11.95), was accompanied by sauteed mushrooms. The steak was a beautiful cut, which Chef Lorenzo proudly demonstrated after I revealed my identity. He brought out an uncooked companion steak to show me the quality and freshness of the meat. The steak was served with the sweetest baked potato I've enjoyed in years. All in all, it was a delicious and hearty combination.
My companion had the seafood medley ($13.95). It included scallops, six large shrimp, 12 mussels, two lobster claws and some lobster pieces nestled in and around a bed of linguini. It also included cooked tomato and garlic and was garnished with yellow pepper, parsley, lemon and scallions. The serving was enough for two but was so good it was almost consumed at one sitting.
Other entrees include scallops over angel hair ($13.95), three peppered sausage pasta ($10.95), a low-fat haddock special ($10.95), veggies primavera ($7.95), lasagna ($9.95) and chicken, veal or eggplant parmigiana ($9.95).
For dessert, I could not resist the key lime pie ($2.95). The crust was not homemade and the topping was canned whipped cream, but the filling was tart and divine.
My companion tried the chocolate cannoli ($1.95). The ricotta based filling had a good flavor and texture and was enrobed in a crunchy, fresh cannoli shell.
Other desserts include spumoni with claret sauce ($3.95) and a banana-chocolate chip bread pudding ($2.95).
Our bill, before tax, tip and drinks, came to $40. It was a great deal for a lot of good food.

VOLUNTEERS TO TRACK SOURCES OF POLLUTION THEIR GOAL IS TO SEE A GREAT SALT BAY CLEAN ENOUGH TO SUPPORT SHELLFISH HARVESTING AGAIN.

Abstract: Volunteers hope to start unraveling a mystery Saturday, when they gather on the banks of Great Salt Bay to hunt for sources of water pollution. Depending on what they discover, the bay - once rich in oysters - could eventually be clean enough to again allow shellfish harvesting. It has been closed for more than a decade. This is the first comprehensive effort to survey the shores of the 400-acre bay, which fronts Damariscotta, Newcastle and Nobleboro. Sponsoring the effort is the Planning Alliance of the Damariscotta River Estuary, or PADRE, with part of a $28,000 federal grant.

Full text:   Volunteers hope to start unraveling a mystery Saturday, when they gather on the banks of Great Salt Bay to hunt for sources of water pollution.
Depending on what they discover, the bay - once rich in oysters - could eventually be clean enough to again allow shellfish harvesting. It has been closed for more than a decade.
This is the first comprehensive effort to survey the shores of the 400-acre bay, which fronts Damariscotta, Newcastle and Nobleboro. Sponsoring the effort is the Planning Alliance of the Damariscotta River Estuary, or PADRE, with part of a $28,000 federal grant.
About 25 people are expected to fan out in teams and question some 200 homeowners living within 500 feet of the shore. They also will be checking for shoreline erosion, looking at septic systems, and making note of agricultural lands with possible fertilizer runoff.
Failing septic systems, one source of pollution, often reveal themselves with an oily sheen on the water, or very green grass.
"If we find a malfunctioning leachfield, we will work with the landowner to correct the problem," said PADRE director Tom Ford. The Departmentof Environmental Protection has a small community-grant program with money available to help, he said.
In assessing the pollution, the group also will take into account the history of the area, including former shipbuilding activities and the presence of an old dump.
Three years ago, the state Department of Marine Resources conducted a similar, but less detailed, survey and found no pollution sources - beyond a known, treated water sewerage system serving Damariscotta Mills.
Still, water samples at about 10 sites around the bay, taken by Marine Resources and the Damariscotta River Association's Tide Water Watch, routinely show elevated counts of fecal coliform bacteria.
Water flow in the bay was changed early this century when causeways and dams were built to create Damariscotta Lake.
"That could have changed the ecology," said DMR Health Director Paul Anderson, taking another stab at the mystery. It also could have altered the way the river flows.
The volunteers have been trained for their task by DMR scientists.
The state agency employs three people to cover a territory from Kittery to Searsport, and cannot handle the work without help, said marine resource specialist Jan Barter.
Between 3,000 and 1,500 years ago, American Indians left heaps of up to 15 million cubic feet of oyster and clam shells, called middens, along the banks of the Damariscotta River just below the bay.
Ford guesses there are far fewer oysters in the bay these days, but the water could be a rich source of hardshell and softshell clams, called quahogs and steamers.
This summer, other volunteers will find them, count them, and check their tissue samples for toxins.
There is hope that in the foreseeable future some of the shellfish could end up on plates.
"The pollution is not really bad," Barter said. "If they can solve some of the problems, Great Salt Bay could be used for harvesting again."

Crab cakes were never mentioned in the early cookbooks - it was always creamed or deviled. "Crab Delight," a dubious mixture of crabmeat cooked in a white sauce with tomato soup and cheese added, served daintily on crackers, appeared to have been the Blue Plate Special.

Along with the warmer weather, we can rejoice over the return of native Maine crabmeat at the local fish markets. I remembered a line from Sandra Oliver's "Saltwater Foodways" about the early use of crabmeat along the New England coast.
"Coastal residents might catch them for their own use, like eels, clams, smelts and other accessible fish," she writes, "but the only formal crab fishery in the 19th century New England was a supplier of bait."
In other words, if a lobsterman had all the bait he could use, the bucket of crabs that he brought in after a day's fishing might be boiled, picked out and turned into crab cakes for supper. Very likely grumbling would be heard around the table. These days, the same entree served "in a pool of mild mustard sauce" is greeted with cheers. It's gourmet fare. Who could have guessed?
Crabmeat first appeared in the cookbooks in the 1930s, about the time the canned product became available, usually from the Chesapeake Bay and south, where labor was cheap. While it never achieved the popularity of lobster, it was agreed that crab was "certainly of better flavor, if more troublesome to prepare."
Crab cakes were never mentioned in the early cookbooks - it was always creamed or deviled. "Crab Delight," a dubious mixture of crabmeat cooked in a white sauce with tomato soup and cheese added, served daintily on crackers, appeared to have been the Blue Plate Special.
Since there has been no real tradition for crab cakes, there has been a virtual free-for-all among New England chefs. Flip open a new cookbook or food magazine and you will find another new crab cake recipe.
(It's only a matter of time before McDonald's produces its crab cake lookalike; most probably called McCrab, promoted with a beanbag toy that will scuttle sideways.)
"New England Fish Tale," by Martha Watson Murphy suggests the following mixture:
2 pounds fresh crabmeat
1/4 pound minced chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup minced onion
1/2 cup minced celery
1/4 cup minced green bell pepper
1 cup corn kernels
1 clove garlic, pressed
2 cups fresh breadcrumbs
3 eggs, beaten
3 tablespoons melted butter, cooled
1/3 cup milk
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
This mixture is made into cakes, sprinkled with cornmeal and chilled before cooking in a heavy skillet with vegetable oil until golden brown.
IN "RECIPES from a Downeast Inn," by Mark Hodesh:
Crab Cakes with Mustard Sauce
1 cup finely chopped onion
2 tablespoons butter
1/3 cup minced fresh parsley
5 large eggs, beaten lightly
2 tablespoons ground toasted hazelnuts
1 tablespoon Old Bay seasoning
3 tablespoons milk
2 1/2 cups medium cracker crumbs
2 pounds fresh crabmeat
The ingredients mixed, formed and sprinkled with bread crumbs. They were baked in a 450-degree oven for 8 minutes, then brushed with melted butter and broiled 2 to 3 minutes longer. Serves 8.
THE BOOK, "Cooking Fish and Shellfish," by Ruth A. Spear, cites a recipe as close to the original crab cake as you can find:
2 cups crabmeat
1/4 cup milk
2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
Salt
1/2 cup fresh breadcrumbs
2 eggs, well beaten
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
This mixture is formed in cakes, fried in butter until golden brown, served with lemon wedges and tartar sauce. This amount makes four to six crab cakes.
FOR THOSE who have trouble getting the cakes to hold together, I am told that packing the mixture into a biscuit cutter does the trick. Let the liquid run out, then unmold the cakes directly onto breadcrumbs before cooking. The result is a uniform, compact cake that stays intact when cooked.

Full text: ABOUT THE AUTHOR Brian Dunkiel is staff attorney and director of tax policy for Friends of the Earth in Burlington, Vt. EFFECTIVE ACTION
States have always played a central role in environmental policy, often having enforcement responsibility even for federal programs.
Given shrinking federal enforcement resources and increased competition for jobs and investment, many states are straining to respond to traditional and emerging environmental challenges.
States need creative new approaches that do more and cost less. Among the most promising of new approaches is putting the tax system to work to improve the environment, a timely subject this week between Tax Day, April 15, and Earth Day, April 22.
This month the Center for a Sustainable Economy, a Washington nonprofit think-tank, released the first comprehensive survey of environmental tax provisions in the states. Author Andrew Hoerner states, "We found environmental tax provisions are effective, popular and that their use is increasing rapidly." The survey identified 462 provisions in 1996, evenly divided between taxes and tax incentives.
MANY TAXES implemented the "polluter pays principle" - that environmental costs should be born by the polluter, not the public. Others promote a wide range of environmental goals, including greater use of clean-fueled vehicles and public transportation, transition to sustainable agriculture and forestry, renewable energy and materials recycling.
Every state has at least one environmental tax measure, and 21 states have ten or more. Maine's 15 environmental tax provisions ranks third most in the nation.
Across the country, we see dozens of innovative measures that create business opportunities while reducing the cost of environmental protection. For example:
In Washington state, a system of tax credits for employer-provided mass transit benefits was found to get people to work for about a third of the cost of building new highways to accommodate the same traffic.
In Florida, a tax of a few cents on bottles, cartons and cans, forgiven if the container industries achieved ambitious recycling goals, resulted in a large increase in recycling and the construction of several recycling plants providing employment in the state.
In Connecticut, a tax on oyster harvests used to re-seed the oyster beds and maintain their quality has helped to bring the industry back from the brink, more than tripling production.
A Minnesota tax on contaminated waste sites, cut in half if a clean-up plan is approved, preserves property tax revenues essential for public education while providing an incentive for cleanup.
THESE EXAMPLES and others show that the states are using tax policy creatively to improve the environment without harming (and sometimes benefiting) their economies.
Still, these provisions have been adopted with little overall planning or coordination, and could be improved with efforts to design them to complement existing environmental regulation. More is needed if we are to reap the full benefit of a greener tax policy. A good first step would be for states to assemble green tax packages, composed of the best tax provisions from around the country.
In Maine, perhaps an environmental tax could be used to help reach agreement on meaningful forest management controls.
For example, a critical disagreement among conservationists and the timber industry is whether to prohibit clearcutting. Even though the issue appears intractable right now, few people disagree that some controls are needed.
SO IF prohibiting clear-cuts is not now politically attainable, maybe a tax levied on the sale of timber harvested by clear-cut that increased with size could be used as an interim measure.
The tax would bring the hidden environmental costs of clear-cutting, like habitat destruction and water pollution, into the industry's ledgers. The tax could be phased in by increasing tax rates over time, encouraging the transition away from clear-cuts. Even better, the revenues could be earmarked to protect sensitive habitats and ecosystems.
A few states are also considering more fundamental environmental tax reform. Such reform would shift the tax burden from things we want to encourage, such as work and investment, to things we want to discourage, such as pollution and natural resource consumption.
A bill to shift about 15 percent of the tax burden onto fossil fuels and off of other taxes has been introduced in Minnesota with bipartisan support from leading members of both houses.
Economic estimates suggest that such shifts can increase employment and improve economic health. Thus, through creative approaches like environmental taxes, we can improve both the environment andthe economy.
For the sake of our children, we can accept no less.

Abstract: Render unto Strong - population 1,217 - the title of Toothpick Capital of the World. For a century, its Forster Mfg. has been America's largest maker of toothpicks, with a mere eight people turning out almost all the toothpicks used in this country, or close to 30 million picks a day. Forster is one of dozens of mills in Maine making small, odd wooden items so nuts-and-bolts rudimentary that most people barely notice they exist. The lifeblood of many small towns, these mills endure and often thrive despite an ever-capricious economy - and, increasingly, amidst the flight of larger industries from the state. At what are often hole-in-the-wall operations, generations of workers have unceasingly churned out a truly stunning array of wooden widgets: Knobs and wheels and handles. Q-tips and golf tees and drum sticks. Beer taps, pepper mills, curtain rings, wooden fruit, coffee stirrers, tongue depressors, tooth-fairy boxes. Sticks and squares for arts and crafts. And toothpicks.

Full text: with sidebar mills
Clattering, hammering din. Lathes and saws laboring. Sweet smell of wet wood, with an unlikely hint of mint.
All in the service of what has been dubbed "one cool little tool" - a tool used, if the anthropologists are right, by Neanderthals, Babylonians, Buddha and the prophet Mohammed, who assigned care of it to a singular servant: Master of the Toothpick.
Render unto Strong - population 1,217 - the title of Toothpick Capital of the World. For a century, its Forster Mfg. has been America's largest maker of toothpicks, with a mere eight people turning out almost all the toothpicks used in this country, or close to 30 million picks a day.
Toothpicks, though, are only one part of an abiding, improbable whole.
Forster is one of dozens of mills in Maine making small, odd wooden items so nuts-and-bolts rudimentary that most people barely notice they exist. The lifeblood of many small towns, these mills endure and often thrive despite an ever-capricious economy - and, increasingly, amidst the flight of larger industries from the state.
At what are often hole-in-the-wall operations, generations of workers have unceasingly churned out a truly stunning array of wooden widgets: Knobs and wheels and handles. Q-tips and golf tees and drum sticks. Beer taps, pepper mills, curtain rings, wooden fruit, coffee stirrers, tongue depressors, tooth-fairy boxes. Sticks and squares for arts and crafts. And toothpicks.
The theory being that someone, somewhere has to make this stuff. Boasts a brochure for Kingfield Wood Products, "We'll do the work other manufacturers could not or would not even attempt to do."
Tom Norton, plant engineer at Kingfield, says the plant has made more than 5,000 different knobs, wheels, rings, boxes and what he calls "knick-knacks." Like almost every other maker of almost every other widget, he says he is amazed that so many people use so many objects for so many purposes.
Like what? He shrugs. And points with pride to a shelf of small boxes in various sizes. He is, he says, baffled as to why people buy them.
"What they would be doing with them, I'll never know," he says. "We just make 'em."
Many of the small mills making so-called wood turnings are clustered in the central part of the state, in Franklin, Somerset and Piscataquis counties. Some have closed, unable to compete with China and other low-wage areas. But many have survived, outlasting traditional industries - fish processing, shoe shops, textiles - that have declined or left.
The wood mills have much in common. Most are old, loud, home-grown plants, often using aging machinery designed in-house. Managers tend to be secretive about the clamorous equipment, protecting it from the view of outsiders because, says one, "Too many people want what we have."
The work is hard on the body, particularly the back. The noise is fierce. Years ago, workers routinely lost the ability to hear it. Today, most are legally required to wear ear plugs.
Many mills are the only or at least biggest game in town, employing a hefty chunk of each town's population - and, further up the line, its woods jobbers and truckers. People often work there for decades, passing down the tradition like a well-worn toolbox to the next generation.
The mills are part of perennial hard times, the place you go when the woods are mud and the shoe shop's closed and construction jobs dry up. They're Maine's mines: Sooner or later, everyone pays their licks and goes to the mill.
The mills use local wood, mostly birch and maple. Their products are wildly diverse. Some - dowels, toothpicks, Popsicle sticks - endure. Others come and go over time, with mills small enough they can adapt to changing demand.
And all are modest enough to escape the vagaries of erratic economies. Like an ice cream cone during the Depression, everyone will spring for it.
Over time, Forster Mfg. has made rolling pins, baseball bats, croquet sets, shish kebab skewers, toboggans. Today, it focuses on clothespins and coffee stirrers, a line of multi-shaped "Woodsies" for crafts, and toothpicks, peerless and abundant.
The company says it makes most of the estimated 30 billion toothpicks Americans use each year - thus earning townspeople the right, it would seem, to the bold claim on their fire engines: "Toothpick Capital of the World."
Origin of the toothpick
The source of their shining pride was invented in 1869 by one Charles Forster. He got the idea for a disposable toothpick on a trip to Brazil, where he saw Indians whittling picks from pieces of orange trees.
He made his first toothpicks in the cellar of his Boston home. When he couldn't market them, he offered to buy some broke Harvard students dinner at Boston's fine old Union Oyster House - if, after eating, they would ask for picks, protest when there were none, and leave in a well-rehearsed huff.
Soon restaurants were offering toothpicks on small silver trays. Forster Mfg. was born.
Forster chose to use white birch for its strength, give, and splinterless qualities. His toothpicks were round until 1984, when they switched to what toothpick experts call square-centered round, and the rest of us call square.
Other things have changed. Family-owned until 1992, Forster's is now a subsidiary of Diamond Brands Inc. China has made inroads into the market. Demand varies, slightly; plant manager Steve Clark calls it "steady-eddy."
The picks, meanwhile, keep coming. At the plant here, 10 miles north of Farmington, they litter the ground, humble testimony to enduring prosperity.
Inside, surprisingly few people hover at the deafening lathes, saws and polishers. About 110 people work here, but only eight make the toothpicks and clothespins. Automation has taken over many tasks. But people still sort clothespins by hand; Clark says they're faster than any machine.
The toothpicks are made from birch bolts that are steamed, sliced into veneer, cut into ribbons, chopped, dried and polished.
The finished product is so elemental there is not much doctoring to be done to it. Some are colored and flavored: mint and cinammon. Mostly, Forster tinkers with marketing - bright displays, varied packages, glowering pictures of James Dean and Clint Eastwood with toothpicks stuck in their tough-guy mouths.
Aspects serious, trivial
At 59 cents a box, toothpicks remain what Clark calls "a throwaway item." Most, he figures, end up in the back of a drawer, lost to memory, adrift in space, randomly replaced the next time someone happens to think of it.
"In other words," he says, "we assume the consumers are losing or throwing away 75 per cent of what we do for a living."
Still, people in this world can take anything seriously. Clark says customers write with comments and criticisms. They report the square picks don't compare to the round. They complain - how else can they know but by counting? - they did not get the right number of picks in the box. ("Rain Man" revisited.)
And what do they use them for? Clark shrugs, offers: party hors d'oeuvres, testing brownies, the makings of "a billion dollar craft industry."
A guy in Illinois used 193,000 picks to create a 16-foot-long replica of the British luxury liner Lusitania. An Arizona artist - "Toothpicks are my medium," she wrote - sculpted an abstract from 16,375 picks, all of them Forster's.
Jack Lambert, Forster's buyer, says there's no limit to the possibilities. He cites only one certainty: "There aren't many of 'em used as toothpicks."
Among this area's mills, says Clark, "We're the big guys."
Always new ideas
Surely, then, the little guy is Charles Hinkley, owner and sole employee of Hinkley Woodworking. Hinkley does custom jobs in his sawdust-shrouded, seat-of-the-pants woodshop just down the road.
He has just made 5,000 flag bases, and 1,000 tic-tac-toe boards. For years, he made wooden blocks to strap onto bike pedals. He has made dollhouse fenceposts, place-card holders, pruning saw handles, four sizes of so-called dog bones.
He digs through chaotic stacks and drawers, picking up and squinting at amorphous chunks of wood he crafted long ago: "They call that a tone block - I dunno what that is . . . That's one they make a whistle out of; don't ask me how . . . Here's some kind of clamp . . . Now what that thing's for, Idunno . . ."
He is confident, he says, his work will not cease.
"There's no end to what they think up," he notes. "I've seen too many things come and go - they'll think of something for me."
Those in the wood novelty business know they make things that escape ordinary citizens' notice. Says Marcia Nile at Maine Wood Turning in New Vineyard, which makes handles, snowmen, knobs, darts and the tops to English Leather Cologne, "They're in the store - that's all people need to know."
Still, a business is a business, and ego be damned. Glenn Doore of Guilford's Pride Manufacturing knows consumers don't care who actually makes all those golf tees, coat hooks, toy parts, cigar tips, furniture plugs and Monopoly pieces, but what the hey: "We're just happy people buy them."
They buy them, he says, because "people like the feel of wood." And, he adds, in a common refrain, because they're good.
Quality is a constant theme at small mills facing the threat of cheaper and, they say, poorer-quality imports. Bruce Perkins, plant manager at Solon Manufacturing, cites a key strength of any small, family-owned business: "There's pride in the product going out the door."
Solon is the country's leading maker of ice cream sticks. It also makes tongue depressors, coffee stirrers, paint paddles and Q-tips in a market Perkins calls "very stable." Weather, not China, is the big threat.
"You don't want it too hot," he says. "Ideally, you want it in the mid '80s. Above that, people are looking for liquid."
Security in small devices
Perkins and others say their products' insignificance is also their security.
"No matter what, people are gonna eat ice cream," he says. "No matter how bad the economy is, or how poor an individual is, they will always find a way to buy their child an ice cream. I don't see (the business) going anywhere."
Tom Norton at Kingfield Wood Products agrees that when people can't afford large pleasures, they opt for small ones. "When the rest of the country is down," he says, "we're usually on the way up."
Kingfield began life in 1901 as the Huse Spool and Bobbin Mill. It has made, over time, cars, trucks, lobsters, snowmen, yo-yos, beer taps, drawer knobs, Chinese checkers, wooden fruit, many boxes, 40 varieties of toy wheels, handles for juggling knives, its own line of drum sticks, and parts of a goose call ("Stop calling to your geese and start speaking their language!")
Many of the employees have been here long enough to see these things come and go. Barbara Bunker, 84, has worked here 46 years. In the early days, she says, "I worked on the machines, like all the other girls." Now, she sorts balls.
All day, she sits at her time-worn cart, green gauze shielding her fingers. On her much-nicked tray, her coffee cup rests in a sea of wood balls.
What are they for?
"Don't ask me," she retorts, profoundly disinterested. "I dunno what they're gonna do with 'em."
Further on, another widget, another mystery: a small wood ring. What's it for? Norton peers at it, puzzles over it, gives up and turns it over to Doug Archer, production manager, who should know these things. He, in turn, studies it.
"Curtain rod rings," he announces. A pause. "I believe."

Correction published Sunday, April 26, 1998: The April 19 Taste & Tell review contained a misstatement regarding the Bridgeway Restaurant in South Portland. The restaurant critic visited the restaurant only once; her second meal fromthe Bridgeway was ordered as takeout food. The review contained several other errors. The Bridgeway Restaurant is closed on Sundays. The restaurant features live jazz music from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Tuesdays and a pianist from 6:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant has no lounge. They were the critic's errors.
After 42 years in business, the Bridgeway restaurant on Ocean Street is an institution. It's been a viable part of the Knightville business district since it opened in 1956.
And not only is the Bridgeway the oldest continuous operating restaurant in South Portland, but it's one of only a few places featuring live jazz in southern Maine.
The Saturday night we visited was a quiet one. The interior was updated in the early 1990s and has a fresh appearance. The walls are beige, and decoration is minimal - a few framed prints and simple linen on the tables. There's a fireplace in the main dining room, which is the only non-smoking area in the place.
Piped-in jazz added warmth to the spartan room. Copious cigarette smoke and strains of live jazz from a piano floated up from the lounge/smokers' dining room a floor below. There is a bar across from the lounge.
Our server, turned out in a black and white uniform, was friendly and outgoing but didn't volunteer any information about the night's specials, which were posted on a board by the dining room entrance.
We asked about the specials and perused the menu. There are seven appetizers ($2.50 to $6.95), five soups ($1.95 to $5.95 cup/$2.50 to $9.95 bowl), three salads ($3.95 small/$5.25 large), six fried seafood dinners ($8.95 to $13.95), 11 broiled or grilled seafood dinners ($8.95 to $14.95), 11 entrees - beef, pork, lamb, ham or chicken - from the char-broiler ($8.95 to $13.95), 10 Italian dishes ($6.50 to $10.95), three combinations ($12.95 to $13.95), lighter fare including sandwiches, burgers and pizzas (($4.70 to $8.95), and a children's menu of four items ($4.95 each). Several Greek specialties are available, including spanakopita ($9.95) and gyro ($5.95).
While we waited for our appetizers, we sampled the bread, a steaming hot loaf. It had been freshly baked at a local bakery and was tasty.
For an appetizer, I tried the oyster stew ($5.95). It was simple: milk, melted butter, lots of oysters. The spices - salt and white pepper - were not discernible. It was bland and unappealing.
My companion had the bacon-wrapped scallops ($6.95). Six scallops, slightly overdone, were presented nicely on a bed of lettuce with some purple cabbage garnish and a lemon slice. While the scallops were a bit tough, the flavor was good.
Other appetizers include seafood-stuffed mushrooms ($4.95), shrimp cocktail ($5.95), onion rings ($2.50) and deep-fried zucchini ($4.25).
Our salads arrived with the appetizers. My choice, Greek, consisted of romaine and iceberg lettuce, tomato, three Greek olives, cucumber, a generous amount of overpowering white onion and an equally generous amount of crumbled feta. Greek dressing was not a choice, so I ordered Italian on the side. Our server told us all the dressings are homemade with the exception of a raspberry vinaigrette. My choice lacked zing and was made from an oil that contained 10 percent light olive oil and 90 percent vegetable oil. I ate my salad without dressing. The feta imparted a great flavor.
My companion ordered the garden salad with blue cheese (45 cents extra). The greens were romaine and iceberg with tomatoes, cucumbers and onions. The blue cheese dressing was pureed smooth. There were no chunks of cheese. It was quite bland.
I tried one of the evening's specials, moussaka ($9.95), a famous Greek dish. This entree is traditionally made with ground lamb, eggplant, potato, onion and spices including nutmeg and garlic. It's topped with a creamy white bechamel sauce.
The Bridgeway substituted beef for lamb and used cinnamon in such a small amount that I couldn't detect it. The dish was served in its own ramekin and was floating in a pool of grease. The best parts were the eggplant and potatoes. It was disappointing. Ditto for the boiled red potatoes with rosemary that I chose from a selection of baked, mashed or fried spuds, or rice. The potatoes contained too much fat and too little flavor.
My companion ordered the Bridgeway Lazy Lobster ($14.95). Sauteed lobster meat was served over seafood stuffing. It, too, was swimming in grease. Two claws and some body meat topped a Ritz crackerstuffing that included tiny pieces of shrimp, scallops, imitation crab, parsley and paprika. The flavor of the stuffing was good, and so was the lobster, though it was a bit dried out.
Entrees are served with either potato and salad, or soup and salad.
Other entree choices include pasta with meatballs or sausage ($6.95), 4-ounce beef tenderloin ($8.95), fried seafood platter of haddock, clams, Maine shrimp ($13.95) and chicken teriyaki ($8.95). Vegetarian entrees include pasta with plain sauce ($6.50), mushroom ($7.25) or garlic butter ($6.50), and vegetarian pizza selections.
Bridgeway has seven desserts, including homemade baklava, a Greek pastry ($2.75); a commercially made cheesecake ($2.50); homemade Grape-nut custard and bread pudding ($1.95 each); and ice cream ($1.75).
My choice, strawberry shortcake ($2.50), was an enormous portion. I never did get a good look at the biscuit, which is purchased from a local bakery. It was submerged under a load of frozen strawberries and an obscene amount of canned whipped cream. Mirroring the rest of the meal, it was bland.
My companion had the apple pie a la mode ($2.75). The pie was a store-bought variety that was served warm. The crust was heavy and the filling very sweet, but the addition of the ice cream tempered it.
Things were not much better on a second visit to Bridgeway. I tried the shrimp cocktail ($5.95). The five medium shrimp were previously frozen. They lost most of their flavor in the freezing/thawing process. They were watery and mushy. The cocktail sauce was a good rendition.
I ordered the lamb kabob ($11.95). Seven good-sized lamb cubes were threaded onto a skewer with a slice of onion between each cube. The meat was an excellent quality and flavor, and was served quite rare. I enjoyed it.
My companion ordered the broiled haddock and scallops in lemon butter ($10.95). There was more butter than was needed. The scallops were large and tender, but the haddock was dry from overcooking. The baked potato with it was also overcooked.
Our bill, excluding tax, tip and drinks, was $44 for the first visit, $29 for the second visit.
All in all, the meal was served too quickly, with everything flying out of the kitchen at once. The fat content was too high in all the dishes - from appetizers to dessert.
While the Bridgeway is a venerable institution, it should update its food preparation in the same way it has updated its interior. It would be nice to have the Bridgeway around for another 42 years.

ON THE FAST TRACK DEMAND IS UP FOR MBA GRADUATES - AND SO ARE SALARIES AND SIGNING BONUSES

Abstract: "I'm very pleased," Barron said. "Coming out of college, I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do. After working awhile and starting a family, going back for an MBA was a great option." Barron, 27, who will graduate from the University of Georgia Terry College of Business in June, is in a crop of students across the nation who, as they near completion of their business master's degrees, are finding that the world is their oyster. Harvard University's business school, rated the nation's best last month by U.S. News & World Report, had a 1997 median starting salary of $82,000 and a 99 percent placement rate. But Woolery said the strong growth of schools such as Georgia that don't have the traditional nationwide prestige of schools such as Harvard, Stanford, and University of Pennsylvania underlines the demand for MBA's.

Full text: Two years ago, Randy Barron was a new father making $25,000 a year teaching high school math and coaching the tennis team.
Last month, he accepted an offer that will earn him more than $60,000 a year to start and will put him on the management track at Exxon.
"I'm very pleased," Barron said. "Coming out of college, I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to do. After working awhile and starting a family, going back for an MBA was a great option."
Barron, 27, who will graduate from the University of Georgia Terry College of Business in June, is in a crop of students across the nation who, as they near completion of their business master's degrees, are finding that the world is their oyster.
"It's a very strong year," said William Woolery Jr., the business college's MBA placement director. "It's very competitive."
William Laidlaw, spokesman for the St. Louis-based American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business, said the same is true around the country. Demand for business master's graduates has jumped in recent years as a result of low national unemployment, a strong U.S. economy, fallout from an era of downsizing of middle managers, and soaring need for specialties, such as information technology managers.
"Business schools offer a nice shopping pool," said Laidlaw, adding that MBA graduates often have maturity and job experience to go with their up-to-date education. They are usually about 28 years old, but many schools report an increase in over-30 students pursuing master's degrees.
Harvard University's business school, rated the nation's best last month by U.S. News & World Report, had a 1997 median starting salary of $82,000 and a 99 percent placement rate. But Woolery said the strong growth of schools such as Georgia that don't have the traditional nationwide prestige of schools such as Harvard, Stanford, and University of Pennsylvania underlines the demand for MBA's.
At Georgia, the median starting salary for MBA graduates has jumped from $47,700 to $55,600 in one year, and the competition has led to increasingly lucrative "signing bonuses," like prized young baseball and basketball players often obtain.
"More and more companies are offering $2,500 or $4,000 just to sign," said Barry Shiflett, director of graduate business placement at Georgia State University. The vast majority of his students want to remain in the Atlanta area, Shiflett said, but the inducements grow for students who are willing to relocate.
At Clark Atlanta University, a small, historically black school, MBA placement director Brent Johnson said the 1997 median signing bonus for 54 graduates who scattered to corporations across the country was $9,000, a figure he said will jump this year because at least four of his students have been offered bonuses of some $20,000 each.
As the competition heats up between companies wooing graduates, the firms are also getting more creative in their approach.
Some companies offer stock options or big interest-free loans. To try to lock in prospects early in the school year, Woolery said, some companies dangle quick-deadline "exploding bonuses." For example, a student might be offered $7,000 to sign on within one week, with the offer cut in half if the student waits longer to commit.
Barron, who emphasized corporate finance and investments in his studies, said after a series of job interviews, he received offers and deadlines so quickly he decided to concentrate on three offers rather than to continue accumulating bids. He rejected a bank in Cleveland and a consulting firm in Washington to join Exxon in Houston.
The company will pay his family's moving expenses and pay him an extra month's salary up front.
His wife Carolyn gave birth this year to their second daughter. His new job will enable her to stay home with their children, as she wants to, Barron said.
They moved to Athens for the MBA program in August 1996 from Broken Arrow, Okla., where Barron had fulfilled a four-year teaching obligation from an education scholarship for his undergraduate studies.
He estimates the business degree will cost him about $80,000 in lost salary and school loans, expenses he expects to quickly recoup in his new career.

BOYS TENNIS
CAMDEN-ROCKPORT: John Lippman will have to wait four more weeks to see whether he can coach the Camden-Rockport boys tennis team.
The Maine Principals' Association told Camden-Rockport officials earlier this month Lippman had to step down as coach of the team because he had violated the state-wide organization's sport-season policy.
Camden-Rockport AD David Cook has taken over the team the last two weeks, and Tuesday night the SAD 28 school board appointed Larry Kinney as boys tennis coach until Lippman's situation is resolved.
Lippman, who has coached the Windjammers the past 12 years, admitted to coaching some of his players during an out-of-season program held at the Camden YMCA.
Camden-Rockport officials are scheduled to go before the MPA's executive committee May 14 to seek a waiver to the rule.
The MPA's rules prohibit coaches from coaching or instructing members outside a sport's designated season.
Two years ago, two coaches from Scarborough were prohibited from coaching after it was determined that a volunteer assistant had coached members of that high school's indoor track team before the official start of preseason practice.
Lippman said he coached some of his players in group lessons that included players from other high schools in the region at the YMCA during the winter months.
"I do this for a living," he said. "It is my sole source of income."
Lippman also serves as a tennis pro at the McGunticook River Golf Club in Rockport and the Oyster Bay Tennis Club, an indoor facility in West Rockport.
Cook said he has sought a waiver in to the sports-season policy for Lippman the past two seasons.
"I never heard anything from the MPA, so I assumed it had been granted," he said.
MPA Executive Director Richard Tyler said he had no recollection of receiving waiver requests from Camden-Rockport for its tennis coach before this year.
"I'm not disputing that they didn't send it," he said. "I may have misplaced the letter and for that I take full responsibility."
Tyler said his organization has approved requests for waivers to its sports-season policy in the past. "We settle each case on its own merits," he said.
Earlier this year, the MPA granted a blanket waiver to the season rule to gymnastics coaches.
"In gymnastics, it became a safety issue," said Tyler, "because schools can't find enough qualified coaches. But tennis is different than gymnastics."
In recent years, high schools in the Camden area have had a hard time finding qualified tennis coaches.
At Georges Valley in Thomaston, the boys team had to be dropped this season because officials couldn't find anyone to coach.
At Rockland, the future of the girls team was in jeopardy until Deborah Trebotich volunteered to take over the squad. Trebotich had recently moved to Maine from Hong Kong.
At Camden-Rockport, Sue Sulzer came out of retirement to coach the girls team when Mike Gray, who had coached the team for the past three years, took a job that prohibited him from coaching the team.
SOFTBALL
BUCKFIELD 20, WAYNFLETE 1: Winning pitcher Angela Damon had a double and single to lead the Bucks past Waynflete in the opener for both teams at South Portland.
The Bucks took advantage of 11 second-inning runs and seven Waynflete errors to wrap up the victory in five innings.
BOYS LACROSSE
BRIDGTON 24, BACK BAY 2: Marc Torrey and D.J. Romanchuk scored four goals each to lead the Wolverines (9-0) over Back Bay (0-2) in Portland.

Abstract: There's a way to help it along once it's dry enough. Be sure to wait until the little lakes on your lawn dry up before raking it, Mark Tschamler of One Call Craftsmen says. Then, rake the debris, dead thatch (buildup of grass that's decayed in order to protect the root system), leaves and limbs. If the thatch gets too thick, the grass can't grow, Tschamler says.

Already tufts of green grass have burst through the earth after the winter season. But still lurking under patches of brown grass, dead leaves and branches blown down fromtrees during the January ice storm, more green stuff is waiting to be free.
There's a way to help it along once it's dry enough. Be sure to wait until the little lakes on your lawn dry up before raking it, Mark Tschamler of One Call Craftsmen says. Then, rake the debris, dead thatch (buildup of grass that's decayed in order to protect the root system), leaves and limbs. If the thatch gets too thick, the grass can't grow, Tschamler says.
Marilyn and Alan Jeff Powers of Portland leave the lawncare to Tschamler. It's much easier, says Jeff Powers.
"I'm on the road a lot, and when I come home it's great to have it all done. Mark does the lawn for us and Marilyn and I work on the flower beds," he says.
Raking is the first and most important step to revitalizing your lawn in the spring.
"Rake the leaves up or they will mold and mildew on the lawn and kill the grass. Do it even if you did it last fall. The grass needs light and air at the soil level to grow," says Mark Faunce, manager of Lucas Garden Center.
In spring, apply crab grass control, a pre-emergent chemical that forms a barrier at the soil level to prevent crab grass seeds from germinating, Faunce says.
Tschamler says an established lawn from that point will do its own thing.
"Mow it and look for signs of critters. Moles will leave piles of dirt or trails of dirt around. There's a remedy for that problem, too," Tschamler says.
"Poison smoke bombs or the family cat are the only remedies I know of" for moles, says Shawn Brannigan, general manager of Allen, Sterling and Lothrop. "There's no nice mole stuff. Usually they do so much damage people want to hurt them."
Havahart traps, which are available in sizes ranging from mouse to woodchuck, aren't effective for controlling moles, he says, because moles live underground.
Brannigan also says moles are attracted to grubs. Eliminate the grubs, and the moles will leave.
Another thing to look for is any sign of erosion. You can fill in an eroded area, then seed it and fertilize it to bring it around.
Start watering your lawn as soon as the temperature warms up.
"Lawns need about an inch of water a week. We don't get that naturally. I advise putting an empty tuna fish can on your lawn, running the sprinkler and when the water reaches one inch in the can, move the sprinkler to another area and do the same thing," Faunce says.
"It's also important to tune up your lawn mower in the spring. Hopefully you've drained the gasoline in the fall. Change the oil, get the blades sharpened, get new spark plugs. Adjust the blades so they cut the grass at 2 inches," Faunce says.
The next step may be a soil test. Tschamler says it's something anyone can do. Inexpensive kits are available that test the PH of your soil. The proper PH balance is necessary to allow plant life to utilize fertilization.
"A PH balance of six or seven gives your lawn its happiest environment," Tschamler says.
Each plant has a PH range at which it will thrive at its optimum. Pines, he says, like acidic soil so you may have to lower the PH for them. Lime increases PH. If you want your lawn sweeter, use more lime.
If you find lots of clover, there's a chemical that will attack it. Or you can use a dandelion puller to eliminate most of the nuisance.
"Most stuff isn't like it was 20 years ago. You don't have to worry about caustics," Tschamler says.
However, if the idea of using chemicals bothers you, there is an alternative. Sunset Farm Organics in Kennebunkport sells an organic fertilizer it says is safe for kids, pets and the environment. It contains such delicacies as bonemeal, kelp, oyster shells, rock phosphate, soap phosphate, green sand and more.
If you decide to apply anything to your lawn, be sure to store leftover products in a safe place.
The Powers family says the lawn care service they use leaves them more time to enjoy the cardinals, blue jays, chickadees and doves that visit the birdhouses back of their house.
They also have a small pond out back where ducks come every year. Jeff Powers says the ducks left after the last storm. He hasn't seen them since.
He says they might have gotten confused because of the weather. Maybe they thought it was spring and it wasn't. We know how they feel. LAWN CARE BASICS
To revitalize your lawn in the spring:
Rake up leaves, fallen branches and matted dead grass.
Fill in eroded areas with loam and then seed and fertilize the area.
Start watering the lawn when the temperature rises.
Use chemicals or organic products to rid the lawn of clover, crab grass and dandelions.
Tune up your lawn mower. Sharpen the blades and set them to cut the grass at 2 inches. "A PH balance of six or seven gives your lawn its happiest environment." Mark Tschamler, One Call Craftsmen

Powers hires Mark Tschamler of One Call Craftsmen to take care of his lawn, which gives him and his wife time to concentrate on the flower gardens.

Full text: He won his school's geography contest. He squared off against 102 of Maine's top geography students, and he emerged as one of two finalists.
Then, with the state geography championship on the line, 13-year-old Greg Thaler of Yarmouth was asked this question:
In 1963 a new volcanic island, Surtsey, emerged from the sea south of what country?
Nobody's heard of Surtsey, right? Wrong.
Thaler calmly answered "Iceland" to win the 10th annual Maine Geography Bee Friday at the University of Southern Maine.
The seventh-grader at Frank H. Harrison Middle School won $100, a world atlas, and an all-expense-paid trip to the national geography bee in Washington, D.C., in May.
Aaron Strong, an eighth-grader at Lewiston Middle School came in second, and Ben Hewlett, an eighth-grader at Conners-Emerson School in Bar Harbor, placed third.
Thaler said he learned about Surtsey in a movie he watched in school last year, and never forgot it. He has a passion for geography that has evolved through his hobbies of collecting stamps and coins.
"I'm really interested in all the different places and peoples and the diversity of everything in the world," Thaler said.
Thaler's mother, Karen Massey, teaches geography at Freeport High School, but she said she hasn't taught her son much about the subject. Instead, he teaches her.
"I was extraordinarily excited that he won," Massey said. "But I was not totally surprised."
The geography bee is sponsored by the National Geographic Society and the Sylvan Learning Center. Students in all 50 states and the District of Columbia compete.
In Maine, fourth- through eighth-graders in about 200 schools participate in local geography bees. The winner at each school takes a test to qualify for the state competition. This year, 103 students qualified.
The contestants at the state bee are asked questions that are so tough that even some of the teachers who organize the event find them challenging, said Bob Johnson, a geography teacher at the Waynflete School in Portland.
For example:
What is the name for hardened tree resin plentiful in the Baltic region? Answer: amber.
The Po River flows into what sea? Answer: the Adriatic Sea.
Students who answer the questions correctly advance; those who answer incorrectly are eliminated. Johnson said this year's contestants answered more questions correctly than students at any previous geography bee.
"The level the kids were working at was extraordinary," Johnson said. "It's a lot of fun to see kids do so well."
Cindy Sargent, a social studies teacher in Yarmouth, said Thaler has always stood out from his peers.
"He's been incredibly gifted all throughout his time at Yarmouth," Sargent said. "He's a very self-motivated learner."
At the national bee in Washington, Thaler will vie for a first-place prize that includes a $25,000 college scholarship.
"I expect it will be tough, but I hope to do well," Thaler said. "I might have a slim chance of winning, if I get lucky." -------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- FOR MORE on geography, see Press Herald Online: www.portland.com GEOGRAPHY QUIZ
Here are some of the questions that 13-year-old Greg Thaler of Yarmouth answered on his way to winning the Maine Geography Bee:
1) Rotterdam is a major port on what sea?
2) Sumerians used tools to write on clay tablets making wedge-shaped marks; what is the namefor this kind of writing?
3) Mayan ruins are in what Central American country?
4) The Alhambra, a Moorish castle, is in what Mediterranean country?
5) The subductive of the Nazca plate gave rise to what mountain system?
Answers: 1) the North Sea 2) cuneiform 3) Guatemala 4) Spain 5) the Andes "I'm really interested in all the different places and peoples and the diversity of everything in the world." Greg Thaler, 13, of Yarmouth

FORMER SHIPYARD AREA GETS REZONED THE SOUTH PORTLAND PLAN DOES NOT ALLOW A SEAFOOD PROCESSOR TO LOCATE IN THE AREA.

Abstract: The city's former shipyard area has finally been rezoned after more than two decades of trying. And the new zoning plan does not include a controversial clause allowing seafood processing in the area. The City Council voted 5-1 - one councilor was absent - on Monday night to approve the zone change. The vote came after councilors listened for more than two hours to residents who packed the council chambers. Most said they feared allowing seafood processing would mean they'd have to live with stench. The shipyard area has been zoned industrial for years. But the new zoning divides it into two zones: the Spring Point zone, which allows for mixed uses including commercial and residential; and the Shipyard zone nextto it, which allows for light industry but prohibits residences. A third, smaller conditional zone was previously approved to allow for a congregate housing facility.

Full text: The city's former shipyard area has finally been rezoned after more than two decades of trying. And the new zoning plan does not include a controversial clause allowing seafood processing in the area.
The City Council voted 5-1 - one councilor was absent - on Monday night to approve the zone change. The vote came after councilors listened for more than two hours to residents who packed the council chambers. Most said they feared allowing seafood processing would mean they'd have to live with stench.
"I'm ecstatic that both the fish processing was removed and the zoning was passed," said Jim Puckett, who lives in a townhouse complex in the area.
The shipyard area has been zoned industrial for years. But the new zoning divides it into two zones: the Spring Point zone, which allows for mixed uses including commercial and residential; and the Shipyard zone nextto it, which allows for light industry but prohibits residences. A third, smaller conditional zone was previously approved to allow for a congregate housing facility.
The area formerly was a cove filled in to build two World War II shipyards. But in the decades since then, it has become home to a variety of largely incompatible industrial, commercial and residential uses. They include oil tanks, restaurants, condominiums and the city's new Bug Light Park, which all struggle to co-exist.
The industrial zoning meant virtually anything was allowed there. Residents learned that the hard way about three years ago when they had to wage almost a yearlong battle to prevent the Irving Oil Co. from opening a tank farm in the shipyard.
Residents didn't want such a fight again. And businesses wanted clear guidelines on what was allowed in the zone so that they wouldn't waste their time and money seeking to move there only to have neighbors oppose them.
So Jeffrey K. Jordan, the city manager, about a yearago directed the formation of a committee made up of business representatives, city officials and residents to come up with a zoning plan. It was the fifth such attempt in about 20 years.
It was that committee's zoning proposal that the council passed Monday. Jordan praised it as a good compromise that preserves the city's goal of a working waterfront, while doing such things as eliminating the heavy manufacturing that is most incompatible with residences.
But it seemed doubtful at times Monday night that the council would approve the zone change, which needed five votes to pass.
The difficulty was a proposal to allow seafood processing in the Shipyard zone. The committee had approved that plan late in the process after Portland Shellfish, an existing South Portland business, had proposed opening a new plant on a 26-acre parcel that Irving had bought next to Bug Light Park for its tank farm.
Nearly everyone at Monday's meeting agreed that Portland Shellfish, which cooks seafood and lobster for sale in grocery stores and restaurants, was a very clean business. And its owner, Jeff Holden, said its only smell was one of cooking.
"Essentially what we're talking about is putting up a $1 million kitchen," he said of his plans for his new operation.
But residents and councilors said they feared that allowing his business would also allow for others not so clean and odor-free.
"We can't do a zone change based around one business. Not everyone runs the same operation," said Councilor Christopher S. Bowring, who proposed an amendment to delete the seafood processing clause.
The vote on the deletion was 4-2, with councilors Birger T. Johnson and Kevin J. Glynn against. Johnson said he was angry that residents had spread "misinformation" comparing Holden's business to Pine State By-Products, a smelly food-rendering business in the shipyard from 1966-84. Glynn wanted to allow shellfish processing in the shipyard to let Holden's business in.
Johnson later voted to uphold the zoning ordinance without the seafood processing clause but Glynn voted against it.
"I'm ecstatic that both the fish processing was removed and the zoning was passed." Jim Puckett, who lives in the area

SEAFOOD PLANT WILD CARD FOR SHIPYARD AREA SOUTH PORTLAND'S NEW ZONING PLAN MEETS RESISTANCE FROM SHIPYARD ZONE NEIGHBORS CONCERNED ABOUT ODORS FROM PROCESSING.

Abstract: A new zoning proposal for the city's former shipyard area is the most promising one in about 20 years for the jumbled mix of businesses and residences in the neighborhood, City Manager Jeffrey K. Jordan says. The committee's proposal marks the fifth time the city has tackled the shipyard zoning issue in about 20 years. This time, Jordan says, a workable proposal has been developed because of the diversity of the zoning committee. The plan calls for two new zones in the shipyard area, with Madison Street as the dividing line: the Spring Point zone, which would allow mixed uses including commercial and residential; and the Shipyard Zone, which would allow light industry but prohibit residences. The council recentlyapproved a third smaller zone in the area, the Conditional Shipyard-1 zone, in which a congregate housing facility is scheduled for construction.

Full text:   A new zoning proposal for the city's former shipyard area is the most promising one in about 20 years for the jumbled mix of businesses and residences in the neighborhood, City Manager Jeffrey K. Jordan says.
But he is worried that the ordinance may not win City Council approval because of a single sentence - one allowing seafood processing plants.
The council will hold a public hearing and final vote on the issue tonight at 7 p.m. at City Hall.
The shipyard area once was the birthplace of the great transport ships that helped win World War II.
Today it's an area where a variety of often incompatible industrial, commercial and residential uses - including oil tanks, restaurants, condominiums and the city's new Bug Light Park - struggle to coexist.
About a year ago, a committee made up of representatives from the varied interests in the area began looking at changing the zoning in the neighborhood.
It's now zoned industrial, which means that virtually anything is allowed. Residents learned that the hard way about three years ago when they had to wage almost a yearlong battle to prevent the Irving Oil Co. from opening a tank farm in the shipyard.
The committee's proposal marks the fifth time the city has tackled the shipyard zoning issue in about 20 years. This time, Jordan says, a workable proposal has been developed because of the diversity of the zoning committee.
Jordan and other city officials praise the proposal as a good compromise that will preserve the working waterfront while eliminating the heavy manufacturing that is most incompatible with residences.
The plan calls for two new zones in the shipyard area, with Madison Street as the dividing line: the Spring Point zone, which would allow mixed uses including commercial and residential; and the Shipyard Zone, which would allow light industry but prohibit residences. The council recentlyapproved a third smaller zone in the area, the Conditional Shipyard-1 zone, in which a congregate housing facility is scheduled for construction.
The plan has won planning board approval. But now Jordan fears it may be derailed by a clause allowing
seafood processing plants in the Shipyard Zone.
The clause was added late in the process, after Portland Shellfish, a South Portland business that processes about 5 million pounds of crab and lobster each year, came to the committee.
Jeff Holden,the owner of the business, wants to open a 20,000-square-foot plant in the Shipyard Zone.
Holden says he and a group of business owners want to buy the 26-acre parcel that Irving had purchased for its proposed tank farm. The parcel is near Bug Light Park.
The committee and the planning board were persuaded to allow seafood processing because Portland Shellfish is a clean, well-operated business, employing about 90 people, city officials and committee members say.
But residents in and around theshipyard area are saying they don't want seafood processing there. Even if Holden's business doesn't smell, they say, others might.
Jordan says that to avoid the failure of the entire ordinance, he is recommending the City Council strike the seafood processing clause from the zoning proposal.
Councilors are likely to hear from residents at tonight's meeting.
A petition will be presented to them signed by about 150 residents in the nearby Ferry Village neighborhood, asking the city not to allow any kind of food processing or rendering in the shipyard area.
Katherine Latendresse, president of the Ferry Village Neighborhood Conservation Association, says many neighbors fear the reappearance of an operation like the former Pine State By-Products.
That business opened in the shipyard in 1966, rendering chicken and fish parts into animal feed. It had odor problems almost from the start and the city finally had to take it to court before it agreed to close in 1984.
Maureen Puckett, who liveswith her husband in a townhouse in the shipyard area, fears living next to such a business.
"We love this area and I don't want to see a business creating such an odor that you can't open your window or sit on your deck," she said. "Whatever the city does is something it's going to have to live with for a number of years. They should think long and hard before they do something that harms this area."
The council appears divided. And the zoning change needs five out the seven votes to pass.
Three of the seven councilors, Christopher S. Bowring, Linda R. Boudreau and Ralph C. Baxter Sr., say they are leaning toward deleting the seafood processing clause.
Bowring plans to introduce an amendment that will do that. "I don't want to see the zoning proposal fail because of one issue," he said.
Bowring served on the committee that came up with the zoning proposal, and initially supported allowing seafood processing. But now he has changed his mind.
He says he believes Holden's business is a "very good operation," but says that "having given it more thought, I think the decision was made around his operation and not the industry as a whole."
Boudreau and Baxter say they don't want to lose the whole ordinance to the issue. Both say they might consider conditional zoning later to let in a particular business such as Portland Shellfish.
Mayor Susan B. Avery couldn't be reached for comment Friday.
Three other councilors, Birger T. Johnson, Nancy L. Larsen and Kevin J. Glynn, want to keep the seafood processing clause.
Johnson said, "My own feeling is because you had an industry years ago that did bad things with its processing, other companies should not be punished."
Larsen says any seafood business that would want to open in the area would need planning board approval, so the board could reject any problem businesses. "I think the seafood processing business is a valid marine use for that area," she said.
And Glynn, who lives about a quarter-mile from Portland Shellfish, considers it an "incredibly fine establishment," far removed from Pine State's business. "There will be no cow heads sitting outside at Jeff Holden's business," Glynn said.
He's proposing that the council amend the zoning proposal to allow shellfish processing instead of seafood processing so Portland Shellfish can relocate in the shipyard area. "We love this area and I don't want to see a business creating such an odor that you can't open your window or sit on your deck." MaureenPuckett

Abstract: The Blue Door is open year-round for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The formal downstairs rooms serve as the backdrop for dinner; breakfast and lunch are served in a rear extension of the building. The decor is in keeping with the house - lace curtains and table toppers, oil paintings of landscapes and small oil lamps on dinner tables. Meals begin with three soups ($2.25 to $4.50) and six appetizers ($4.25 to $6.95). Entrees include six seafood dishes ($7.95 to $14.95), seven fried seafood dinners ($8.95 to $22.95 and market price), four poultry selections ($8.95 to $11.95 and a chef's choice priced daily), five beef offerings ($11.95 to $16.95), the three light entrees ($7.95 to $9.95) and a four-item kids' menu ($4.50). Several specials are offered each evening. My soup was a baked onion ($2.95 cup, $4.50 bowl). Served in a cup, bread cubes were floating in the soup and were topped with cheese. The whole cup was run under the broiler until it was bubbling. It was a disappointing version, pale and lacking a robust onion flavor.

The Blue Door Restaurant & Inn is one of many beautiful and historic homes on Route 202 in Alfred Village. This charm-loaded, scenic section of highway is a delight to travel.
The Blue Door is open year-round for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The formal downstairs rooms serve as the backdrop for dinner; breakfast and lunch are served in a rear extension of the building. The decor is in keeping with the house - lace curtains and table toppers, oil paintings of landscapes and small oil lamps on dinner tables.
It's apparent that the unflappable wait staff - two sisters - have been working at their trade for a long time. They are as sturdy and reliable as the house itself, and they call customers "dear."
The menu is what you would expect of a travelers' roadhouse restaurant. Here, tradition holds, with the emphasis on beef, seafood, chicken and fried foods. With the exception of three dishes billed as "light entrees," new, lighter American cooking is not among the offerings.
Meals begin with three soups ($2.25 to $4.50) and six appetizers ($4.25 to $6.95). Entrees include six seafood dishes ($7.95 to $14.95), seven fried seafood dinners ($8.95 to $22.95 and market price), four poultry selections ($8.95 to $11.95 and a chef's choice priced daily), five beef offerings ($11.95 to $16.95), the three light entrees ($7.95 to $9.95) and a four-item kids' menu ($4.50). Several specials are offered each evening.
While we waited for our soup to arrive, we sampled the homemade dinner rolls, served warm with butter. They reminded me of my grandmother's - tender, fragrant, satisfying - and a delight to pull apart.
My soup was a baked onion ($2.95 cup, $4.50 bowl). Served in a cup, bread cubes were floating in the soup and were topped with cheese. The whole cup was run under the broiler until it was bubbling. It was a disappointing version, pale and lacking a robust onion flavor.
My companion ordered the chowder ($2.95 cup, $4.50 a bowl). This rich, buttery soup was full of haddock, small pieces of potato and onion. It was finished off with a bit of black pepper and oyster crackers. The flavor was full-bodied and delicious.
We ordered the baked Brie ($6.50), which came with bread and fresh fruit. The small round of Brie was served warm, covered with sliced almonds and honey. A demi loaf of bread, frozen and baked at the restaurant, came along with it, as well as thin slices of apple, orange sections and kiwi. The presentation was nice and the combination tasty.
Other appetizers include fried cheese sticks ($4.25), stuffed mushrooms ($5.95) and Buffalo wings ($5.95).
Dinners come with a choice of potato, vegetable, soup or salad. The salad contained iceberg and leaf lettuce, cabbage, carrot, cucumber, green pepper, tomato and croutons. None of the dressings is homemade. I ordered the poppyseed, onthe side. While the flavor was OK, my salad arrived already liberally dressed. It detracted from the enjoyment.
I selected one of the evening's specials, roast pork stuffed with apples and pecans ($14.95) and an anisette-flavored sauce. The pork was overcooked or had dried out in the kitchen while waiting to be served. The rich stuffing had an interesting texture and flavor and was the better part of the dish. The anisette sauce had a cream base and offered a subtle infusion of taste.
Also on the plate was homemade applesauce that was good, though suprisingly sweet because of the brown sugar that had been added, and a twice-baked potato. The potato was over-baked. There was a side dish of canned green beans that had been mixed with canned tomatoes, onions and peppers. It was old-fashioned and heavily salted.
My companion ordered the blue plate special, a seafood dish of tri-colored linguine ($16.95). A huge dish of pasta was topped with a generous amount of scallops, three lobster claws, shrimp, mushrooms, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots and red pepper, and covered with a sherry cream sauce. The vegetables were still crunchy, and the scallops and lobster were good, though the latter was very salty. The shrimp disintegrated in the dish.
Other entrees include haddock in bread crumbs ($7.95), turkey dinner ($8.95), prime rib ($11.95 to $16.95) and vegetable lasagna ($7.95).
The Blue Door is known for its homemade pies ($2.50 slice), all made by the owner's daughter.
The chocolate cream, a deep, dark colored version, was so thick you almost had to slice though it. I didn't care for the consistency - it was too thick - and the chocolate flavor didn't match the intensity of the color. It was topped with a plethora of canned whipped cream.
My companion ordered the lemon meringue. The filling was incredibly thick. The lemon flavor was good, and the meringue was high and nicely browned. The crusts of both pies were heavy.
Other pie choices were apple crumb, blueberry, pecan, Toll House cookie and coconut cream. Other desserts include bread pudding ($1.95), Grape-Nut pudding ($1.95), ice cream ($1.95), sundaes and parfaits ($2.50).
Our bill, without drinks, tax or tip, was $48.

FRESH GARDEN DILL OFFERS LOTS OF FLAVOR FOR LITTLE SEED

Abstract: If it hadn't been for dill pickles, the herb might never have found its way out of the Northern European countries to these shores. Nicholas Culpeper, in the mid-1600's, described dill as "unprofitable, being never put to any use." Since it was not found in English gardens, it was equally ignored here in America. Fortunately for us, dill can easily be grown in a small space. There are at least two varieties (and I plan to plant them both.) One is Dukat Dill, bred in Finland. Its flavor is exceptional, especially nice with shellfish and fish, and a natural with cucumbers and carrots. Shepherd's catalog suggests chopped Dukat sprinkled over ripe tomatoes, freshly steamed potatoes, green beans or buttered yellow squash . . . and a handful in a mixed salad just before serving. The dill to plant if it's seeds you need is Shepherd's Bouquet Seed Dill. It grows big umbels of yellow lacy flowers that are followed by seed heads. Add some dill seed to potato salad or coleslaw; steamed cabbage, squash, carrots and cauliflower. And if you put up pickles, you won't have to run to the store for this item.

Have you remembered to send in your seed order? Did you include a packet or two of dill?
If it hadn't been for dill pickles, the herb might never have found its way out of the Northern European countries to these shores. Nicholas Culpeper, in the mid-1600's, described dill as "unprofitable, being never put to any use." Since it was not found in English gardens, it was equally ignored here in America.
It seems a pity that Culpeper had never tasted chopped fresh dill flavoring a mild cream cheese or cottage cheese, or discovered it in a potato salad or a platter of cold salmon - or even in a mustard-based sauce. All of this came with other cultures, other food styles, but it took some time.
One of the first translations of European recipes into English, "The Heart of the Settlement Cookbook," listed only dill pickles as a possible use for the herb. This was in 1901.
Fortunately for us, dill can easily be grown in a small space. There are at least two varieties (and I plan to plant them both.) One is Dukat Dill, bred in Finland. Its flavor is exceptional, especially nice with shellfish and fish, and a natural with cucumbers and carrots. Shepherd's catalog suggests chopped Dukat sprinkled over ripe tomatoes, freshly steamed potatoes, green beans or buttered yellow squash . . . and a handful in a mixed salad just before serving.
The dill to plant if it's seeds you need is Shepherd's Bouquet Seed Dill. It grows big umbels of yellow lacy flowers that are followed by seed heads. Add some dill seed to potato salad or coleslaw; steamed cabbage, squash, carrots and cauliflower. And if you put up pickles, you won't have to run to the store for this item.
Danish Cucumber Salad
3 large cucumbers, peeled
Salt
2/3 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill leaves
Slice the cucumbers very thin. Arrange them in layers in a ceramic bowl, sprinkling each layer with salt. Put a plate on top of the cucumbers with a heavy weight on top, holding it down firmly. Leave the bowl out at room temperature for several hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Drain the cucumbers thoroughly, and pat them dry with paper towels. Return them to the bowl.
In a small skillet, heat the vinegar, water, sugar, salt and pepper until it comes to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer 3 minutes. Pour this hot mixture over the cucumbers and sprinkle with chopped dill. Chill for 3 to 4 hours, then drain cucumbers and serve in a glass bowl surrounded by red or yellow cherry tomatoes. Serves 6 to 8.
HERE IS A versatile recipe that can be made with any cooked grain - rice, barley, millet, couscous - all work well with the steamed broccoli and the fresh taste of dill.
Dilled Grain & Broccoli Salad
1 medium bunch broccoli
3 1/2 to 4 cups cooked grain
1 1/4 cups minced fresh dill
1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes, chopped
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 to 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
Trim and cut broccoli in bite-sized pieces. Steam on a rack until crisp-tender, then run under cold water to set the color. Drain. Combine the grain, broccoli, dill and tomatoes in a large bowl. In a small jar (with a top) combine the oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice. Shake well and pour over the salad. Toss until blended. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Serve on a bed of lettuce.
THIS RECIPE depends upon having small, new potatoes and fresh dill - as well as allowing the dish to stand at room temperature for an hour before serving so the potatoes can absorb the flavors.
Dilled Potato & Green Bean Salad
1 pound green beans, trimmed
1 pound small new potatoes, just cooked
1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/4 cup olive oil
3/4 to 1 cup tightly-packed minced fresh dill
1 to 3 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
Sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
Steam the green beans until tender-crisp, about 3 to 5 minutes. Run under cold water and drain. Cut into thirds lengthwise and place in serving bowl.
Cut the cooked new potatoes in quarter-inch slices and add them with the walnuts and the beans.
In a blender or food processor, combine the oil, 3/4 cup of the dill, 1 teaspoon mustard, 1 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar and the salt and pepper. Blend to a thick, creamy dressing. Check the seasonings, adding more mustard and vinegar if necessary.
Toss the vinaigrette with the potato/bean mixture and let it marinate at room temperature at least an hour before serving. Serves 4.

Abstract: If telephone calls to the athletic offices at the University of Southern Maine are an indication of interest, there could be a line today for tickets to the women's Division III Final Four games this weekend. "The phone has been ringing off the hook," said Debra Rossi, an assistant to USM Athletic Director Al Bean. "We've even been getting calls from out of state. Tickets are on sale at the USM ice arena in Gorham from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. today and Thursday. Ticket sales Friday start at 10 a.m. and will continue throughout the day.

Full text: If telephone calls to the athletic offices at the University of Southern Maine are an indication of interest, there could be a line today for tickets to the women's Division III Final Four games this weekend.
"The phone has been ringing off the hook," said Debra Rossi, an assistant to USM Athletic Director Al Bean. "We've even been getting calls from out of state.
"I've never had this volume of inquiries before. It's pretty exciting."
As Rossi was answering questions,her phone continued to beep from incoming calls. She assumed the calls were basketball fans in search of tickets.
"And this is only Tuesday," she said.
Tickets are on sale at the USM ice arena in Gorham from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. today and Thursday. Ticket sales Friday start at 10 a.m. and will continue throughout the day.
The cost of a ticket is $5. There is no limit on how many tickets an individual may purchase at one time. Hill Gymnasium seats 1,400, but bleachers can be added to accommodate another 600.
A separate ticket is needed for Saturday's consolation and championship games. One ticket is good for two games each night.
"I've heard people were planning on lining up outside to wait for the tickets to go on sale," said Bean. "It's first-come, first-served."
Rowan (26-2) plays Washington (25-2) in Friday's opening game at 6 p.m. USM (28-2) and Mount Union (28-2) play 30 minutes after the completion of the first game.
The consolation game is at 5 p.m. Saturday, with the national championship 30 minutes after the end of the first game.
WASHINGTON UNVERSITY, from St. Louis, Mo., and Rowan University, from Glassboro, N.J., are flying into Portland late today. Mt. Union College from Alliance, Ohio, should arrive early Thursday.
All three visiting coaches - Nancy Faye, Washington; Candice Crabtree, Rowan; and Deanne Knoblauch, Mt. Union - were interested in Maine's weather and the price of lobster.
"What do you mean there's no snow?" asked Knoblauch. "Maine withoutsnow in the winter doesn't sound right."
Faye said a $10 lobster was a bargain in the Midwest.
"If you live out here, that's considered a deal," she said.
Shellfish vendors should take note.
MT. UNION didn't take an easy route to the Final Four.
The Raiders got a first-round bye but then needed a layup from All-American guard Suzy Venet with two seconds left to play to beat Calvin, 57-56, in a second-round game. Mt. Union had to overcome a 17-point deficit in a 79-74 victory againstSt. Benedict of Minnesota and then defeated St. Thomas of Minnesota 67-63 in the sectional final.
"Those games gave our fans a lot of heart attacks," said Knoblauch. "But when you get to this time of the season, you have to be ready for it."
Mt. Union has won 14 straight. The Raiders are 14-0 when scoring 80 points or more and 21-1 when scoring 70 or more.
VENET, A 5-foot-5 senior, is a candidate for Player of the Year in Division III, and both professional women's leagues have expressed interest in her.
Venet's numbers reflect an all-around player. She is the only college player ever to record two quadruple doubles, and in her career has had 10 triple-doubles.
She needs 13 assists to become Division III's single-season leader. The record is 303.
"She broke all the strength-testing records for women at our school," said Knoblauch. "She can play 40 minutes and not be tired."
For the record, Venet averaged 37.2 minutes, 18.3 points, 9.7 assists and made 82 percent of her free throws. She also led the Raiders in rebounding, with 6.7 per game.
Not surprisingly, Venet was the top scorer in 23 of Mt. Union's 30 games, including the final six.

Abstract: Town councilors voted 8-0 Monday night to accept a settlement with Harpswell on the location of the line that separates the two towns. The vote took place without a word from the public, unlike in Harpswell, where the issue generated rancorous debate before and at the annual town meeting Saturday. Eventually, voters there overwhelmingly supported the deal. In the agreement, Brunswick gives up 200-300 acres of tidal water and mud flats, in addition to 5-acre Crow Island in Middle Bay. And both towns agreed to work together on water-quality issues that affect the bay and threaten its delicate ecosystem.

Full text: Town councilors voted 8-0 Monday night to accept a settlement with Harpswell on the location of the line that separates the two towns.
The vote took place without a word from the public, unlike in Harpswell, where the issue generated rancorous debate before and at the annual town meeting Saturday. Eventually, voters there overwhelmingly supported the deal.
In the agreement, Brunswick gives up 200-300 acres of tidal water and mud flats, in addition to 5-acre Crow Island in Middle Bay. And both towns agreed to work together on water-quality issues that affect the bay and threaten its delicate ecosystem.
"This is one of the best results I've ever had in my career," saidEd Bradley, the attorney representing Brunswick. "I think common sense prevailed."
The two towns now will work together to survey a new common boundary, which has to be approved by the state Legislature.
"This brings Harpswell and Brunswick together to agree on the line, and it never has to be an issue again," Bradley said.
Clam diggers from Brunswick and Harpswell for years worked on each other's flats with impunity under a cooperative shellfishing agreement. When that agreement broke downin 1994, it became necessary to know exactly where the town border was.
It soon became clear to Harpswell residents that the line was not clear at all. Brunswick, and until that point Harpswell, had been relying on a line drawn by the U.S. Geological Survey. But the charters for Harpswell and Brunswick, drawn by the Massachusetts Legislature in the 1700s, described conflicting lines.
Ironically, though Harpswell came away with as much as 300 more acres, a vocal group of residents there fought the settlement, arguing that the town was settling for too little.
They believed that Harpswell had a claim to all the land in Middle Bay up to the high-water mark on the Brunswick side. And they wanted the town to go to court to prove it, a battle that some predicted could have lasted for years and cost as much as $100,000.
"It wasn't crystal clear," Bradley said of the town's position. "I commend you for understanding that that uncertainty translated into expense and risk."
"This could have been an expensive and long-drawn-out disaster," Brunswick Councilor Michael Feldman said.
Chairman Stephen McCausland commended Councilor David Gleason and Harpswell Selectman Gordon Weil for meeting on their own and working out the terms of the agreement when efforts to mediate a solution went nowhere.

Abstract: One man voiced his opposition to a 630-mile natural gas pipeline by strumming a guitar and singing a song. Another man held a moment of silence for the animals and trees the pipeline would disturb. They were two of the dozens of people from Pownal, Yarmouth, Cumberland and several other towns who complained to federal officials Tuesday about a $1 billion pipeline that would run from Nova Scotia through Maine to Massachusetts. Most people said they support the project, but are opposed to the route the pipeline is taking through their towns. They said the pipeline would, among other things, destroy old stands of trees, slash through back yards, and threaten clam and lobster populations.

Full text: One man voiced his opposition to a 630-mile natural gas pipeline by strumming a guitar and singing a song. Another man held a moment of silence for the animals and trees the pipeline would disturb.
They were two of the dozens of people from Pownal, Yarmouth, Cumberland and several other towns who complained to federal officials Tuesday about a $1 billion pipeline that would run from Nova Scotia through Maine to Massachusetts.
Most people said they support the project, but are opposed to the route the pipeline is taking through their towns. They said the pipeline would, among other things, destroy old stands of trees, slash through back yards, and threaten clam and lobster populations.
"Don't give up the land for no rusty pipeline," sang JimHale of Pownal as he played his guitar.
About 70 people attended the hearing at Harrison Middle School organized by officials with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC is gathering comments on a draft environmental impact statement it issued for the project last month.
That 2-inch-thick report analyzed the 347 miles of pipe that would run from Westbrook to the Canadian border. It concluded the project would have a "limited adverse environmental impact."
The pipeline will run underground and is 2 feet in diameter in most places. It is scheduled to deliver natural gas to southern New England from offshore wells in Nova Scotia by November 1999.
Throughout the fall and winter the project has generated controversy in several communities. Maritimes & Northeast has negotiated route changes with such towns as Cumberland, Richmond and Yarmouth to satisfy some opponents.
For example, residents of Cousins Island in Yarmouth vowed in the fall to lie down in front of bulldozers because of the pipeline would destroy trees. But after months of negotiations and several route changes, a Cousins Island resident told FERC Tuesday that the neighborhood now supports the project.
The strongest opposition Tuesday came from residents of Pownal. The proposed route through the town is almost entirely outside of utility line corridors. Pownal residents want it to run entirely inside the corridors, most of which are already cleared for power lines.
"We are not opposed to the Maritimes & Northeast pipeline," said Stephen Hyde of Pownal. "We are adamantly opposed to the taking of private and town-owned lands for this project.
"We hope that common sense will prevail," Hyde continued. "But if necessary we are prepared for a long siege."
Pownal and Maritimes & Northeast are nearing an agreement that would place 75 percent of the route through the town in the utility corridor owned by Central Maine Power Co. They are having trouble with the remaining section, about 4,300 feet of pipe, because of conflicts with CMP's use of the corridor.
Other complaints came from people living on Pleasant Valley and Blanchard roads in West Cumberland. They said the pipeline will destroy trees that shield their homes from the big power lines.
And Jay Pinkham, chairman of the Yarmouth/North Yarmouth Shellfish Committee, said Maritimes & Northeast should have to relocate clam and lobster populations in the area where the pipe goes underwater.
Brian Prenda, a Maritimes & Northeast spokesman, said the company will continue to do all it can to address the concerns of all the communities.
He said he's confident the conflicts will be resolved in the next few months. The company expects FERC to approve the project early this summer, and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to give its approval next fall, Prenda said.
Laura Tuner, the project manager for FERC, said it appears the pipeline company is making good progress in its negotiations with the communities, though she said it remains uncertain whether FERC's approval will meet the company's schedule.
The comment period on the draft environmental report ends March 23. FERC is holding hearings on the report tonight in Gardiner and Thursday in Bangor.

Full text: A late-night fire Wednesday closed J's Oyster on the Portland waterfront. Workers said Thursday that they didn't know how long it would take to make repairs.
The fire started at 11:30 p.m. as the kitchen was being cleaned up for closing. A broiler above a range was set on high as part of the cleanup and apparently ignited some grease, which started a fire in the ceiling, said Deputy Fire Chief Rick Curran.
The business was open at the time. Nobody was injured in the fire, but the repairs and cleanup will take time, said the owner, Cindy Moran.

TOWNS PROPOSE BOUNDARY SETTLEMENT THE PLAN STILL MUST BE APPROVED BY THE HARPSWELL TOWN MEETING, BRUNSWICK TOWN COUNCIL AND THE LEGISLATURE.

Abstract: Correction published March 4, 1998: A story Tuesday on Page 1B of the Coast edition about the proposed boundary settlement between the towns of Harpswell and Brunswick should have said Harpswell could gain between 150 and 200 acres of water and tidal flats, including 5-acre Crow Island. Incorrect information was provided to the newspaper. After months of sometimes acrimonious exchanges, a Brunswick councilor and a Harpswell selectman were able to work out a settlement in the dispute over their town boundaries in about an hour last week, avoiding spending as much as $100,000 in litigation. In separate meetings Monday, selectmen and councilors voted unanimously to bring the proposed agreement to formal votes at the March 14 Harpswell town meeting and the March 16 Brunswick council meeting. The Brunswick council vote will be preceded by a 7:30 p.m. public hearing on the settlement.

Full text: Correction published March 4, 1998: A story Tuesday on Page 1B of the Coast edition about the proposed boundary settlement between the towns of Harpswell and Brunswick should have said Harpswell could gain between 150 and 200 acres of water and tidal flats, including 5-acre Crow Island. Incorrect information was provided to the newspaper.
After months of sometimes acrimonious exchanges, a Brunswick councilor and a Harpswell selectman were able to work out a settlement in the dispute over their town boundaries in about an hour last week, avoiding spending as much as $100,000 in litigation.
"I guess it went faster than I thought it would," Selectman Gordon Weil said. "It was easy in that both of us had a lot of background."
If the agreement is approved, about one-third of an acre on Brunswick's side of Middle Bay, including Crow Island, will become the property of Harpswell.
In separate meetings Monday, selectmen and councilors voted unanimously to bring the proposed agreement to formal votes at the March 14 Harpswell town meeting and the March 16 Brunswick council meeting. The Brunswick council vote will be preceded by a 7:30 p.m. public hearing on the settlement.
If both towns endorse it, the new boundary must then be adopted by the state Legislature. The action will clear up inconsistencies in the Massachusetts legislation that created Brunswick in 1738 and Harpswell 20 years later.
The towns also agreed to work cooperatively on maintaining the water quality in Middle Bay, a delicate habitat for shellfish and animals.
"I'm particularly excited about that part of it," Brunswick Councilor Eleanor Swanson said. "We were always talking about half a bay, and you cannot accomplish that way what two towns working together can."
For decades, the exact location of the line in the mud between the two towns was irrelevant. Their clam diggers shared common licenses and were able to dig freely in each other's flats.
Harpswell dissolved that agreement in 1994. Harpswell diggers were permitted to dig only in their own town, as were Brunswick diggers. The problem arose when the towns could not agree on the exact location of the boundary.
In October, Harpswell filed suit in Cumberland County Superior Court, where a judge recommended that the towns try mediation before litigation. The formal mediation process had not yet begun when Weil and Councilor David Gleason met face to face last Tuesday to see if they could come to an agreement.
Harpswell's new property will include all of Crow Island and the water and tidal flats south and east of it, almost to Barnes Point.
Officials from both communities praised the agreement, and the fact that it could negate the need for costly litigation.
"This will save both communities a considerable amount of money," Gleason said.
Estimates on the cost of litigation went as high as $100,000; mediation could have cost about $10,000.
"Each party had some view of their likelihood of prevailing," Weil said. "There is always a risk in litigation that things will turn out worse."
Weil said Harpswell already has spent $25,000 on research. When asked if it was worth it for one-third of an acre, only half of which is tidal, Weils said: "There is a certain economic value to land over time."
If voters at the Harpswell town meeting do not adopt the agreement, they will have the option of continuing with litigation. If they defeat that proposal as well, the line will remain where Brunswick had placed it, coinciding with the U.S. Geological Survey's placement. "I guess it went faster than I thought it would." Gordon Weil, Harpswell selectman

When clam season opens again Sunday, clam diggers will have about 75 more acres ofmud flats where they can dig in their rakes in search of steamers.
State officials earlier this month said the water quality around the flats had improved to the point where the clams were perfectly safe to eat and could be harvested from areas that previously were off limits. Little by little, clam flats in York County are reopening after years of being closed.
The soft-shell clam - a k a the steamer - is a strong component of Maine's coastal heritage. For generations, Mainers have dug clams for fun and for their livelihoods.
But in the 1980s, tens of thousands of acres of clam flats closed along the state's coastline after strict new federal regulations on bacterial pollution put the sites off-limits.
In southern Maine, nearly every clam flat was closed and clamming became but a memory in many towns. But in the past three years, they have been coming back to life in Kennebunkport, Ogunquit, Wells and Eliot.
Officials say there are two main reasons for the resurgence: cleaner water and better water testing to prove the flats are clean enough to produce safe clams.
In Wells, clamming was banned outright in the mid-1980s. Most clam flats had been shut down on and off for years before that. But over time, the waters became cleaner because of the town's new sewer system, which was built in the 1970s and eliminated much of the sewage that had been discharged directly into the ocean.
With the water less polluted, the town still had to document its cleanliness before clamming would again be allowed. To do so, a network of volunteers established a water-testing program to prove the waters were clean. Under law, the clam flats are considered too polluted to dig clams unless they can be proven otherwise.
The payoff came on March 17, 1996, when dozens of residents took to the flats in Wells for the first time in years.
Marshall Boston, who serves on the Wells Clam Conservation Committee and helped lead the charge to open up the flats, said the open acreage has grown steadily each year since. The town now issues 400 recreational clam permits a year.
"People in Wells, some of us have been digging clams since we were youngsters," Boston said. "They're quite tasty."
The same thing happened in Ogunquit, where most clam flats reopened last year after being shut down in 1988.
"It's part of the tradition, the way of life, in coastal communities to be able to get your own food, especially when it's right there and you can see it growing," said Isabel Lewando, an Ogunquit resident who worked to help get the flats open.
SMALL COMMERCIAL HARVEST
Maine's commercial clam digging industry stretches roughly from Scarborough to the eastern stretches of the state, where many diggers supplement their incomes seasonally by harvesting clams. Washington County at one time was the world's largest supplier of soft-shell clams.
In southern Maine, however, clamming is primarily a recreational undertaking, where residents dig a peck of clams on weekends for fun and a meal. The commercial harvest in York County has hovered between nothing and 61,000 pounds of clam meats each year since 1980. Some years - most recently in 1993 - there has been no commercial harvest.
The commercial harvest in the county is limited to "depuration" clamming, a process in which clams are dug from marginally polluted areas and then cleaned in a depuration plant.
Spinney Creek Shellfish in Eliot is the only licensed depuration plant in Maine. It pumps the contaminants out of the clams and sellsthe cleaned product to retailers and restaurants.
Paul Anderson, director of the public health division of the state Department of Marine Resources, said about 50,000 acres of once-closed clam flats statewide have been opened since 1995. He credits the resurgence to three factors.
First, he says, municipal wastewater treatment plants have improved, resulting in less sewage flowing into the ocean where the clams live. He also credits laws that lessen the amount of waste being discharged from individual homes.
Another factor, he says, is that people are more aware and better-educated about "non-point" pollution - or runoff from yards, parking lots, farms and other places that are difficult to pinpoint - and how to take steps to minimize it. Homeowners, for example, may be prone to use less fertilizer on their yards if they think it might eventually run into the ocean when it rains and add to the pollution.
"I don't mean to paint an amazingly rosy picture, but all these factors are slowly improving the environment," Anderson said. "As it improves, we're opening up clam flats."
REAPING THE BENEFITS
The focus on water quality also has motivated people to help the clams in other ways.
In Wells, volunteers began re-seeding clam flats with juvenile clams, and thinking up ways to deter green crabs from decimating the clam population. Green crabs crack open clam shells and eat the clams.
The results of all the work can be seen on most weekends and holidays when residents - sometimes dozens of them - take to the flats to rake their daily allowance.
Nonresidents, too, are enjoying the benefits. When the town issued its nonresident clam licenses on Feb. 13, a line formed outside town offices at 4:30 a.m. The town's 40 nonresident licenses were gone in a half-hour.
Michele Dionne, a marine ecologist at the Wells Reserve, has worked on clam seeding and pollution programs since 1995. She thinks getting people involved in bringing back the flats has made them more aware of the world around them in general.
"I think the interest people have in clams is great because it's motivating them to look into water-quality issues and other conservation issues in their towns," she said. Commercial clam harvest
The state's commercial clam harvest brings in millions of dollars annually to clam diggers, but has fallen three straight years.

Isabel Lewanco, an Ogunquit resident who helped to get the flats reopened after a decade-long closure, said: "It's part of the tradition. The way of life in coastal communities to be able to get your own food, especially when it's right there and you can see it growing." Jon Paine rinses a peck of clams in the Ogunquit River in early November. Experts point to improved water quality and better means of testing water for the upgrade in clam flats. Another 75 acres will reopen to harvesters when the season begins Sunday.

The clam harvest in York County isn't limited to just recreational diggers. There are also "depuration" diggers who harvest clams commercially from Biddeford to Eliot.
Spinney Creek Shellfish in Eliot sends crews to clam flats statewide - including spots in York County that are deemed too polluted for recreational digging, but are clean enough for the clams to be harvested and cleaned at the Spinney Creek depuration plant.
Once the clams get to the plant, the contaminants are pumped out and the clean clams are sold to retailers and restaurants, primarily in New England but as far away as Aspen, Colo.
In Ogunquit and Wells, some of the local residents frown upon the depuration harvesters. Why, they ask, should Spinney Creek benefit from their hard work of testing water quality and seeding the flats?
Marshall Boston, a member of the Wells Clam Conservation Committee, said most residents feel that the clams should be reserved only for residents of Wells and a few out-of-town recreational diggers.
"If we're putting in the work and the money, then we should be able to control our flats," said Boston. "We should be able to say yes or no."
Paul Anderson, director of the public health division of the state Department of Marine Resources, said local towns have the authority to manage clam flats that are deemed clean enough for recreational and commercial harvesting. But the state maintains the management authority over areas that are too polluted for everyday harvesting.
Areas that are marginally polluted, which include many spots in York County, can be harvested by commercial diggers as long as they are treated at the Spinney Creek plant, the only licensed depuration plant in the state.
By law, Spinney Creek has to hire local diggers, when they are available, to join its own digging crew. It also has to follow a host of other regulations and pay the towns 50 cents for every bushel its crews harvest.
Anderson said Spinney Creek has been given a bum rap by some towns. The company, he said, has good conservation practices and gives local diggers a chance to make a few bucks clamming.
"It's unfair that some of these towns don't give them a fair shake," Anderson said.
Tom Howell, president of Spinney Creek, said his company has 12 to 14 harvesters of its own, and also buys from commercial diggers up the coast where the company has buying stations in Waldoboro and Phippsburg. Less than 30 percent of its clams come from polluted areas.
The company, which hopes to handle 20,000 bushels this year, is also in the process of building a new hatchery at its plant. That way, Howell said, the company can help local communities reseed their flats to keep the clam populations healthy.
Howell said, "We want to be the `Johnny Clamseeds.' "

Abstract: As a travel-happy member of the Geritol Generation, I'm turned off by Caribbean cruise commercials portraying bikini beauties and bronzed hunks - fugitives from a Calvin Klein ad - cavorting by the pool, romantic couples nuzzling in the tropical moonlight, tuxedos and evening gowns at dinner and wannabe Las Vegas extravaganzas in the show room. A few brochures, travel guides and toll-free phone calls later, the Commodore Cruise Line emerged as a likely choice. What it offered was a seven-night cruise to Cozumel and Play del Carmen in Mexico, Jamaica and Grand Cayman. The Commodore brochure showed a relaxed, casual atmosphere.

Full text: Michael Horton is a free-lance writer who lives in Brunswick.
As a travel-happy member of the Geritol Generation, I'm turned off by Caribbean cruise commercials portraying bikini beauties and bronzed hunks - fugitives from a Calvin Klein ad - cavorting by the pool, romantic couples nuzzling in the tropical moonlight, tuxedos and evening gowns at dinner and wannabe Las Vegas extravaganzas in the show room.
The same goes for a bald, fat TV personality surrounded by adoring lovelies, wolfing down a poolside lunch and then, winking slyly at the camera, saying with mouth full, "I can't wait for the midnight buffet."
Laugh-a-minute frolics, shipboard romance and show-biz glitter are no longer the sea-going attractions they might have been in my past. What counts now are the eternal verities of cruising - sun, sea, siestas, and service minus the glitz and synthetic glamor - at a price in line with retirement incomes.
A few brochures, travel guides and toll-free phone calls later, the Commodore Cruise Line emerged as a likely choice. What it offered was a seven-night cruise to Cozumel and Play del Carmen in Mexico, Jamaica and Grand Cayman.
The Commodore brochure showed a relaxed, casual atmosphere. The cruise begins and ends in New Orleans, an added attraction. Travel Holiday magazine called the cruise "the best value in the Caribbean." Rates begin at $498 a person, double occupancy. So my wife, Lydia, and I booked.
The ship is the Enchanted Isle, a converted 40-year-old ocean liner which, under various names, long plied the North Atlantic and Mediterranean. At one point it was Holland America's Veendam.
In contrast to the new megaliners, which weigh up to 100,000 tons and carry 3,000 passengers, the Enchanted Isle at 23,000 tons carries 750 guests. As a classic liner, its staterooms are larger than those on the new floating high-rises build specifically for the cruise trade.
We arrived from Portland (spending $300 round-trip with senior coupons) the day before sailing to enjoy a bit of New Orleans. We checked into a Travelodge 10 minutes from the dock at a special rate of $35 a person arranged by Commodore. Then we headed for the French Quarter and enjoyed the jazz brunch at The Court of Two Sisters.
Next we strolled to central Jackson Square, with its street musicians, artists, fortune tellers and jugglers. We made the ritual stop at Cafe du Monde in the nearby French Market for coffee with chicory and beignet - a doughnut without the hole.
We had a Creole dinner of crawfish etouffe and oysters Rockefeller at the legendary Galatoire's Restaurant, today somewhat out of place amid the sleazy tourist traps that now dominate Bourbon Street.
Next came a pilgrimage to Preservation Hall, the ramshackle shrine of old -time jazz. The standing-only, jampacked room has no seats, no drinks, no restrooms - just great music.
Next day at dockside we admired the ship's sleek, graceful lines and fresh, bright colors. On board, we had the impression the painters and decorators had just left. The decor was quiet and tasteful. Our inside stateroom (who needs a porthole at a higher price?) was adequate in size with plenty of closet space and a well equipped bathroom. Our cheerful cabin steward, a Jamaican, helped us get settled.
The lounges, bars, dining room and other public areas were restfully decorated. The sun decks, classically made of teakwood, were spacious, with a small swimming pool.
Food is the leading attraction on all such cruise ships, and the budget-priced Enchanted Isle is no exception. It pampers its guests with a lavish international menu (escargot and lobster bisque on French night) including six courses with multiple choices, and cheerful, brisk service. In addition to the dining room there is a help-yourself-bistro, a sundeck barbecue and free room service.
Casual garb prevails. Even on the two dress nights, a jacket and tie suffice for men.
The main lounge presents an evening show with a seven piece orchestra and a troupe of dancers and singers, led by a comedian-emcee. Not Broadway level, nuy entertaining. Rehearsals of these shows are a day-time attraction of the lounge.
Other daytime activities include bingo, "horse racing," which is a standby of ocean liners, art auctions and a wine-and-cheese tasting. Some might fault an overamplified sound system in the lounge and on decks, but there is always the tranquility of the card-and-library room for reading, bridge and scrabble.
A discoteque lured the late-nighters, which did not include Lydia and me. A piano bar is an intimate refuge. There are first-run films in the movies theater.
A casino operates day and night, with slot machines, roulette and blackjack.
Other facilities include a duty-free gift shop, beauty parlor, medical center, fitness room with exercise gear and a small pool for working off the calories picked up at those dinner.
Shore excursions offered a tempting choice. We took a visit to the historic Mayan ruinsin Cozumel, a rafting trip down a rain-forest stream in Jamaica, and a memorable submarine ride in Grand Cayman to view exotic marine life, underwater vegetation, and a sunken ship or two. The sightseeing submersible, including a window for each of its 40 passengers, was a splurge at $79, but a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
A lively attraction in Grand Cayman ius the offshore Stingray City. Guests in swimsuits wade out to play with the friendly - despite their name - denizens.
The words "duty free" dominate the dockside shops at every stop. Advertising leaflets, distributed at shipboard briefings before each stop, state with refreshing candor that the shops pay a "promotional" fee to the cruise line.
We spurned the world famous brands. Arthur Frommer, tue guru of budget travel, says "Most island `bargains' are jokes. We did buy a few locally made knicknacks and condiments, and some Cuban cigars.
After the cruise we spent two more days in New Orleans, taking a Gray Line Tour, riding the full length of the St. Charles trolley line, an eating several Cajun and Creole meals. The Enchanted Isle's home port added a delightful "lagniappe," or a little something extra, to the cruise.
The seven night cruise leaves every Saturday year round. For reservations or further information, call the Commodore line at 1-800-237-5361.

Abstract: The menu at Broad Arrow is large and diverse. It offers traditional tavern fare jazzed up for today's sophisticated tastes, including sandwiches like baked cheese on herbed foccacia ($2.95) withham ($1.50) or tomato (50 cents); burger ($5.50) with cheddar ($1), mushrooms (75 cents) or onion (50 cents); chili with chopped onion and cheese ($5.50); and an updated version of pizza baked in the wood-fired oven. Larger brick oven pies include a Southwestern version ($9.95 for an 8-inch, $13.95 for a 12-inch) with spiced ground beef, onion, peppers, blue corn chips, three cheese blend, and red sauce. It's finished with lettuce, onion, tomato, olives and jalapenos. Seafood pie ($16.95/$20.95) contains lobster, shrimp, scallops, roasted corn, scallions, white sauce and grana cheese. The goat cheese crisp was an unusual combination. A large portion of warmed cheese was sitting on a toasted herbed foccacia. The apple pear conserve was served on the side, nestled in a bed of greens. The goat cheese had a good taste and texture, and was enhanced by the spicy conserve. The large hunk of foccacia, the "crisp," was a clunky addition. This dish was good but needs refinement in presentation.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
The Broad Arrow Tavern at the Harraseeket Inn has moved from a small area in the basement to a large room with two window-lined walls facing Main Street.
The Tavern's dark teal-green walls have been reproduced in the new space, and the hunting and fishing regalia, stuffed animal and fish trophies, and framed sportsman prints and paintings have been rehung.
The wood-fired grill and kitchen are open to diners' view and provide wonderful smells. A fireplace on an interior wall divides the dining area and a small bar. The ceiling is low, and, with the dark walls, the room should feel cozy, like a hunting lodge.
A better lightingarrangement would help. The evening we visited, the track lights mounted on the ceiling were aimed in such a way that they caused annoying glare and uneven pockets of light. The light over our table was out, and reading the menu was a challenge.
Though the atmosphere is casual at the Tavern, the dining experience the night we were there was not relaxing. The place was packed. The wait staff was racing around the large dining room, and the racket from the kitchen raised the noise level.
Our waiter, while trying to be helpful, lacked polish and even some basics. He didn't serve water until our meal was almost finished, though we asked him several times. It seemed like the staff was still striving to become a team and hadn't jelled yet. It's a problem owner Chip Gray says he is aware of and working to solve.
The menu at Broad Arrow is large and diverse. It offers traditional tavern fare jazzed up for today's sophisticated tastes, including sandwiches like baked cheese on herbed foccacia ($2.95) withham ($1.50) or tomato (50 cents); burger ($5.50) with cheddar ($1), mushrooms (75 cents) or onion (50 cents); chili with chopped onion and cheese ($5.50); and an updated version of pizza baked in the wood-fired oven.
Small pizzas - "pizzettes" - are served as appetizers and include pesto shrimp with grana cheese ($7.95), barbecued pork with cheddar and scallion greens ($6.95) and smoked trout with mozzarella, creme fraiche and tomato ($7.95).
Larger brick oven pies include a Southwestern version ($9.95 for an 8-inch, $13.95 for a 12-inch) with spiced ground beef, onion, peppers, blue corn chips, three cheese blend, and red sauce. It's finished with lettuce, onion, tomato, olives and jalapenos. Seafood pie ($16.95/$20.95) contains lobster, shrimp, scallops, roasted corn, scallions, white sauce and grana cheese.
More traditional dinner fare is also offered with many unusual twists. For starters, there are spicy chicken wings with tangy red pepper sauce ($4.95), natural cheeses and fresh fruit with house breads ($7.95), lobster stew ($5.50 cup, $8 bowl), steamed Maine clams ($8.95) and jumbo shrimp cocktail ($1.95 each/six for $6.95).
All entrees are a la carte, and two salads are available: mixed local greens ($4.50), and Caesar ($5.95), with beef ($8.95), chicken ($7.95), and shrimp ($1.95 each).
Entrees include steamed Maine lobster, clambake and wood-roasted Maine lobster (all market price); brochette of mixed grill ($10.95); rosemary-rubbed beef tenderloin fillet ($17.95) stuffed with roasted garlic; spit-roasted chicken ($8.95 half, $14.95 whole); and seafood fettucini alfredo ($16.95).
Each offering on the menu has a wine or beer suggestion to complement it - a great idea.
Wine is served by the glass or the bottle ($4.25 a glass and up); beer is served by the bottle, glass or pint ($3.50 and up). We tried the 1996 Murphy-Goode Reserve Fume Blanc ($5.50 glass, $25 bottle). It had a mellow, smoky flavor that complemented the wood-roasted food. Full bar service is available.
For appetizers, we chose the oven-roasted oysters with spiced butter ($9.95), and the goat cheese crisp with apple pear conserve ($5.75). The six large oysters were unevenly done. The several that were cooked to "warm" had a delicious flavor enhanced by the wood smoke and the butter. The underdone ones were not as appealing.
The goat cheese crisp was an unusual combination. A large portion of warmed cheese was sitting on a toasted herbed foccacia. The apple pear conserve was served on the side, nestled in a bed of greens. The goat cheese had a good taste and texture, and was enhanced by the spicy conserve. The large hunk of foccacia, the "crisp," was a clunky addition. This dish was good but needs refinement in presentation.
Before the entree, we tried a salad of mixed greens ($4.50). The lettuces, grated carrots, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, radiccio and sunflower seeds were a nice combination, but the roasted shallot balsamic vinaigrette dressing lacked oomph and needed more vinegar.
For an entree, I selected the grilled fillet of slacked salmon ($14.95). The term "slacked" means coated with molasses, an old-time treatment of curing meat and fish. The salmon had a sweet, charred coating, while the inside retained its moisture.
It was served with roasted potatoes that had no seasoning and were bland. It also came with a delicious medley of wood-roasted vegetables - beans, broccoli, red and yellow peppers, red onions and carrots.
My companion ordered the baked penne pasta with charred vegetables and herbed ricotta ($9.95). This generous portion was rich with crusty cheese but lacking in vegetables. The flavor was good, but the dish would have been better if the cheese-to-vegetable proportion was reversed.
For dessert, I tried the grilled pound cake ($5.50). A fresh slice of pineapple, caramelized on the grill, was served with two oversized, triangular wedges of thick cinnamon flavored pound cake and homemade double vanilla ice cream. The plate was decorated with chocolate and powdered sugar. The portion was enormous and the pinneapple was succulent.
But I had the same feeling about this dish as I did about the goat cheese crisp. It needs refinement in proportion and presentation. And this time it had too many flavors going at once - pineapple, caramel, ice cream, chocolate, cinnamon and powdered sugar.
My companion had the apple pie ($5). It was a large wedge, loaded with apples, gently spiced and served with homemade ice cream.
Other dessert choices include dessert pizza with a choice of topping ($4.95); chocolate truffle samore ($6), oven-baked banana sundae ($6) and blueberry pie ($4.50, $5 with ice cream).
Our bill, without wine, tax or tip, was $65.
The Broad Arrow Tavern is already popular. It will be first rate in food and service - like the main dining room at the Harraseeket Inn - as soon it smooths out the details. And tempers the lights.

THREE SEAFOOD RECIPES MAKE THE MOST OF MOLLUSKS, CRUSTACEANS

Abstract: Aquatic creatures with a hard, jointed outer skeleton, such as crabs, crayfish, lobsters and shrimp, are crustaceans. Various species live in both salt and fresh water. They regularly grow out of their outer bodies, shedding an old suit for a larger model. Place the jumbo and small shrimp (shells and all) in a blender or food processor. Add 2 1/2 cups water and process. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and set aside to cool. When it has cooled, blend or process it again. Strain the mixture through a fine strainer; discard the broken shells and reserve the puree. In the saucepan in which the shrimp was cooked, poach the scallops in the sherry for 1 minute. Stir in the shrimp puree and the milk and heat slowly until it reaches a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream. Season to taste. Serve hot or chilled, garnished with a sprig of dill or snipped chives. (Serves 4 to 6)

Even though I've lived among them for 30-odd years, I've never been quite sure aboutshellfish: for example, which is a mollusk and which is a crustacean?
After digging around in various books, I've found that mollusks have shells and this group includes bivalves, such as abalone, oysters, clams, mussels, scallops, cockles, winkles, whelks and the sea urchin (which is also an echinoderm).
Aquatic creatures with a hard, jointed outer skeleton, such as crabs, crayfish, lobsters and shrimp, are crustaceans. Various species live in both salt and fresh water. They regularly grow out of their outer bodies, shedding an old suit for a larger model.
Shrimp and langoustine, also known as Dublin Bay prawn and Norway lobster, have also been called the scavengers of the sea - all of which leads up to a recipe I have for you this week, one that might be called
Mollusk and Crustacean Soup
(Scallop and Shrimp)
8 ounces unpeeled raw jumbo shrimp
8 ounces unpeeled raw small shrimp
4 sea scallops, halved
2/3 cup dry or medium sherry
1 1/4 cups skim milk
2 tablespoons sour cream
Salt and ground black pepper
Dill or chives, to garnish
Place the jumbo and small shrimp (shells and all) in a blender or food processor. Add 2 1/2 cups water and process. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and set aside to cool. When it has cooled, blend or process it again. Strain the mixture through a fine strainer; discard the broken shells and reserve the puree.
In the saucepan in which the shrimp was cooked, poach the scallops in the sherry for 1 minute. Stir in the shrimp puree and the milk and heat slowly until it reaches a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the sour cream. Season to taste. Serve hot or chilled, garnished with a sprig of dill or snipped chives. (Serves 4 to 6)

NOT ONLY ARE scallops sweet little morsels, but they are very low in fat. One of my favorite dishes is a quick stir-fry over rice, using any of those multicolored peppers when they are available:
Quick & Spicy Scallops and Peppers
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 large green bell peppers, cored & thinly sliced
2 large yellow bell peppers, cored & thinly sliced
2 large red bell peppers, cored & thinly sliced
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded & thinly sliced
2 tablespoons dry red wine
1 pound scallops, rinsed and patted dry
1 tablespoon minced fresh basil (or 1 teaspoon dried)
1/2 teaspoon salt
In a large nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add all the peppers. Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the wine and continue to cook for 1 minute.
Add the scallops (slicing if necessary), basil and salt, stirring to combine. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the scallops are cooked through. Serve hot.
Chilled Shrimp
with Remoulade Sauce
1 cup mayonnaise (low-fat Hellmann's is OK)
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh tarragon
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 tablespoon drained capers
1 teaspoon sweet paprika
1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard
Pinch cayenne pepper to taste
1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 garlic clove
12 ruby leaf lettuce leaves, washed, dried & chilled
2 pounds shelled, deveined and cooked shrimp, chilled
6 sprigs fresh tarragon
To make the remoulade sauce, use a small glass or ceramic mixing bowl. Whisktogether the mayonnaise, tarragon, parsley, capers, paprika, mustard, cayenne and lemon juice until thoroughly combined.
Insert a wooden toothpick into the garlic clove and stir it around in the sauce, allowing the garlic to remain in the sauce.
Cover and refrigerate 2 hours, removing the garlic clove before serving.

WEATHERVANE: BIG SERVINGS, SMALL PRICE A FULL-FILLING DEAL

Abstract: The menu includes fish and clam chowder ($2.45 small, $3.45 regular), cocktail shrimp, cherrystone clams or oysters on the half-shell (75 cents each; six for $4.25), steamed mussels ($3.95) and steamed Maine clams (priced daily). Broiled and baked dinners are also available in the regular and smaller seafarer sizes, including baked haddock ($11.45), baked jumbo shrimp ($12.95), broiled swordfish (priced daily), and a three-way combo - broiled haddock, scallops and jumbo shrimp ($14.45).

It spurred us on to order the appetizer special of the evening, a fried combo consisting of mushrooms, onion rings, mozzarella sticks and potato skins ($4.99). It was large enough to feed four. Along with the food came three sauces for dipping - ranch dressing, marinara and melted cheese - and sour cream. The onion rings and mushrooms were our favorites, covered with a light batter and fried to a light golden color. The oil tasted fresh, and the food was served piping hot. The potato skins could have been crunchier, and the mozzarella was boring.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
Venturing into the Weathervane Seafood Restaurant on the Sunday after the ice storm, we found a satisfying and comforting meal.
The family-style restaurant was jam-packed with tired, cold, hungry people of all descriptions. In spite of the hubbub, the young staff was cheerful and working at top speed.
The restaurant is divided into long, narrow corridors, separated by wainscoted walls that rise about 4 feet. Tables are flush against the walls, with a center aisle between the tables in each section. The intent is to make it appear that diners are on a ship. The downside is that you cannot see over the wall and enjoy an unrestricted view of the dining room.
Weathervane's decor is nautical. Fish, oars, buoys and framed prints of ships abound.
Obviously, the entire concept has worked well for the chain. Begun more than 25 years ago, Weathervane has 17 restaurants in New England and New York, with four more slated to open soon.
The full menu is available all day, and a luncheon menu is served from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. A daily specials menu is also offered, as is full bar service, though there is no bar area.
The menu includes fish and clam chowder ($2.45 small, $3.45 regular), cocktail shrimp, cherrystone clams or oysters on the half-shell (75 cents each; six for $4.25), steamed mussels ($3.95) and steamed Maine clams (priced daily).
Appetizers are a fried affair - onion rings and nuggets (95 cents/$2.95 regular), mushrooms with ranch dressing ($2.25/$3.25), mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce ($3.75/$5.45), calamari ($2.95/$3.95), and potato skins with cheese ($2.25/$3.25).
The dinner menu is huge. There are fried seafood dinners including fish and chips ($4.25), fillet of sole ($6.95), bay scallops ($6.95) and seafood combos - scallops, shrimp, fish and clams ($8.95/$12.96 jumbo).
There are seafarer dinners with smaller portions of fried seafood at smaller prices ($2.95 to $6.25). Fried dinners are served with French fries, cole slaw, rolls and butter.
Broiled and baked dinners are also available in the regular and smaller seafarer sizes, including baked haddock ($11.45), baked jumbo shrimp ($12.95), broiled swordfish (priced daily), and a three-way combo - broiled haddock, scallops and jumbo shrimp ($14.45). Broiled and baked dinners come with a choice of tossed salad or chowder, baked or mashed potato, French fries or rice pilaf and rolls and butter.
There are also grilled chicken and seafood dishes; shrimp scampi ($9.45) and chicken tenders regular or barbecued ($6.45) are two of the choices. And there are "mainland" meals including broiled sirloin (priced daily), and broiled boneless chickenbreast ($7.95).
The traditional Maine lobster clambake is offered year round and in many combinations, with single, twin or triple boiled lobsters, super-sized lobsters - 1 1/2 pounds and up - with sirloin and steamer clams or mussels (all priced daily).
Lobster is also offered as fried tails ($13.95), with other fish combos and as a lobster roll dinner ($8.95).
While we waded through the menu, we got to observe other diners' meals being delivered to their tables. Enormous platters of mostly fried food smelled delicious.
It spurred us on to order the appetizer special of the evening, a fried combo consisting of mushrooms, onion rings, mozzarella sticks and potato skins ($4.99). It was large enough to feed four. Along with the food came three sauces for dipping - ranch dressing, marinara and melted cheese - and sour cream. The onion rings and mushrooms were our favorites, covered with a light batter and fried to a light golden color. The oil tasted fresh, and the food was served piping hot. The potato skins could have been crunchier, and the mozzarella was boring.
The other appetizer we ordered was steamed crab legs ($8.95). Seven meaty claws were served with drawn butter, a lobster bib, cracker and a plastic, two-tined seafood cocktail fork. The fork was useless, and I resorted to the tried-and-true method of extracting the meat with my teeth. There was nothing graceful about consuming this shellfish, but the sweet meat was worth the effort.
While we waited for our entrees, my companionwas served a salad of iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, red onion and croutons. It was a mediocre salad, and so was the honey mustard dressing that came with it. Also served were basic brown-and-serve rolls.
My entree, a sea-and-shore combo of broiled haddock and fried oysters ($9.45) was a mixed bag. The oysters were good and plentiful. But the haddock, while nicely done, was lounging in a ramekin with way too much butter. My baked potato came with sour cream and butter and was not overbaked.
My companion's baked stuffed lobster pie ($17.95) was loaded with lobster and, once again, too much butter. The bread crumb stuffing was mixed with crab and was soggy, but the lobster meat was tasty.
The side dish ordered with this dinner was rice pilaf. It was the only inedible part of all the food we sampled. It was so overcooked it had turned mushy, and the overriding flavor was salt.
With the amazing amount of food served to all diners at the Weathervane, it's hard to imagine that anyone would orderdessert. But we did our best and discovered that, of the restaurant's many bargains, dessert is the biggest.
Four choices are offered - strawberry shortcake ($1.49), cheesecake with strawberries ($1.99), and hot fudge or strawberry sundaes (99 cents). I chose the hot fudge, a thick, rich sauce poured over good ice cream. It was served in a huge dish and was delicious. My companion chose the strawberry shortcake and was delighted by the homemade biscuit, generous frozen strawberries and whipped cream. Once again, the serving was enormous.
Our bill, before tax, tip and beverage, was $43.75. The average diner would spend far less and walk away satisfied.
The Weathervane is a good port to stop in, even without a storm.

Abstract: Gov. Angus King nominated Lewiston Police Chief Michael F. Kelly as public safety commissioner Monday, the second time in four months that King has tried to fill the job. Bowater Inc. stunned northern Maine on Thursday by hanging a "for sale" sign on its Great Northern Paper mill in Millinocket, a century-old facility that was once the world's largest newsprint mill. Over the next three years, Bowater's actions are likely to mean the loss of up to 300 jobs at the East Millinocket mill. The outlook for the Millinocket mill remains uncertain. Its future depends on whether another company buys it and can operate it profitably. If not, the 800 workers in Millinocket would lose their jobs as well.

Lewiston police chief gets nomination for state job
Gov. Angus King nominated Lewiston Police Chief Michael F. Kelly as public safety commissioner Monday, the second time in four months that King has tried to fill the job.
At a State House news conference attended by Kelly and members of his family, King described his nominee as a "model police officer" who enjoys the respect of his peers and subordinates.
Kelly, 42, was chosen chief of the year in 1996 by the Maine Chiefs of Police Association. He worked his way up to the position over 17 years, having previously served as a Lewiston patrolman, detective and sergeant. His nomination awaits a review by a committee of legislators and confirmation by the Senate.
MILLINOCKET
Bowater puts up for sale century-old paper mill
Bowater Inc. stunned northern Maine on Thursday by hanging a "for sale" sign on its Great Northern Paper mill in Millinocket, a century-old facility that was once the world's largest newsprint mill.
But theSouth Carolina-based company stressed that it's not abandoning the area. Bowater plans to invest $220 million next door in East Millinocket to modernize a companion paper mill.
As many as 1,100 of the roughly 1,400 jobs at the two mills could be in jeopardy as a result of Bowater's decisions to sell one plant and modernize the other.
Over the next three years, Bowater's actions are likely to mean the loss of up to 300 jobs at the East Millinocket mill. The outlook for the Millinocket mill remains uncertain. Its future depends on whether another company buys it and can operate it profitably. If not, the 800 workers in Millinocket would lose their jobs as well.
While job cuts and potential losses are unwelcome news, Bowater's decision does represent a major long-term commitment to the economy of northern Maine.
Referring to the plans for modernizing the East Millinocket mill, Gov. Angus King said, "They're investing something over $200 million. That's not dumping a facility; that's anchoring afacility."
WILTON
Rural town faces future without Bass shoe plant
For the first time in generations, people in this rural town face a future without a Bass shoe factory.
Along Main Street, from Mario's Pizza to Sassy Sizzors to the United Methodist Church, people questioned what will happen to their town when the G.H. Bass & Co. plant closes after 122 years, leaving 350 people looking for work.
Bass, the town's largest employer and taxpayer, announced Wednesday that the plant will close this summer. People expect the ripple effect of shuttering the plant will be enormous, ranging from the loss of paychecks to the loss of the town's identity.
"This is just going to be devastating to the town," said Vicki Gordon, owner of Sassy. "I can't imagine."
WATERVILLE
Opera house and cinema to host movie festival
Many Maine communities would be happy just to have a movie theater. Waterville is about to get its own movie festival.
The Maine International Film Festival is scheduled for July 10-19 at the Waterville Opera House and Railroad Square Cinema.
The festival would show films that otherwise might not make it into local movie theaters. Organizers hope to show 30 films, three times each, at the 10-day event.
The organizers don't expect the festival to be another Sundance - one of the handful of American film festivals that attract attention from the movie industry. Their goals are to bring independent and foreign films to Maine that might not come here otherwise, getMaine some attention from filmmakers and build an annual event that might draw tourists.
"We want to add to the summer cultural scene and give film buffs an opportunity to see a whole lot of films," said Joan Phillips-Sandy, a Waterville lawyer and the festival's director. "This is not a one-shot deal. We're expecting it to be an annual event."
AUGUSTA
Monhegan Islanders get hearing on lobster zone
More than 200 residents of Monhegan Island and the mainland communities across Muscongus Bay crowded into a legislative hearing Tuesday to argue about who can set lobster traps in the rich waters around the island.
At issue is a bill that would effectively prevent mainlanders from entering the island's traditional trapping territory. Also at stake, however, may be the future of the island's year-round community and the state's legal tradition that public resources belong to all citizens.
"We need protection for our resource, our way of life and the future of our island community," said Sherman Stanley, a sixth-generation lobsterman from Monhegan Island.
"I don't think the Atlantic Ocean belongs to anybody, and a lobster doesn't belong to anybody until it's in your trap," said Keith Simmons, one of five lobsterman from Friendship who want to set traps near the island.
The bill was introduced after the five men got state permits to fish in the area and marine resources officials feared the destruction of fishing gear and even violence this winter. A compromise allowed the two groups to set traps in different areas until the Legislature could settle the issue.
SANFORD
Merge nightclub ordered to stop holding `raves'
A popular nightclub here that has attracted crowds of young people from as far away as Boston could be shut down if it continues to hold all-night dances, the town's codes enforcement officer said Tuesday.
Merge, which has become one of southern Maine's hippest clubs for teen-agers since it opened last August, has been ordered by the codes officer to stopholding "raves" on the weekend and to fix more than 30 code violations.
Raves, begun a decade ago in England, are all-night, alcohol-free dance parties hosted by a disc jockey and characterized by a light show and a throbbing, never-ending beat.
Merge holds after-hours dances on Saturday nights, in violation of its license from the town.
"We're not trying to put anybody out of business," said Paul Demers, Sanford's codes officer. "They're not licensed to operate after 1 a.m. and the code problems are a serious public safety issue."
AUGUSTA
Study finds state allows too much toxic discharge
Maine's environmental regulators have done a poor job of controlling toxic chemical discharges into the state's rivers, according to a new study by the Natural Resources Council of Maine.
The study found that the Department of Environmental Protection often allows sewage treatment plants and industries to discharge wastewater with relatively high levels of lead, copper, mercury or other toxic substances.
The findings are important because high levels of certain toxic chemicals already have been found in Casco Bay and some other coastal waters.
If the toxic releases aren't reduced at the plants, advocates say, wildlife could suffer and people who eat fish, lobsters, clams or other shellfish could be exposed.
"They're investing something over $200 million. That's not dumping a facility; that's anchoring a facility." Gov. Angus King, on Bowater's plans to modernize an East Millinocket mill even while putting a nearby one up for sale
"I don't think the Atlantic Ocean belongs to anybody, and a lobster doesn't belong to anybody until it's in your trap." Keith Simmons, a Friendship lobsterman commenting on Monhegan Islanders' claim to a protected zone
"We want to add to the summer cultural scene and give film buffs an opportunity to see a whole lot of films. This is not a one-shot deal. We're expecting it to be an annual event." Joan Phillips-Sandy, director of Waterville's new filmfestival
"This is just going to be devastating to the town. I can't imagine." Vicki Gordon, owner of Sassy Sizzors, on the coming closing of Wilton's Bass shoe factory and the loss of 350 jobs

Abstract: Charles Grenough "Chippy" Chase, 89, of Mere Point Road, a highly acclaimed woodcarver whose bird figures are in museums all over the country, died Wednesday. Mr. Chase began carving birds as a hobby in 1933 while he was a mathematics teacher at St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H. He began carving birds professionally in 1949 and exhibited his carvings in countless museums, including New York's Natural History Museum. His bird No. 302, an American oyster catcher carved in black walnut, was displayed in the Oval Office of the White House during Gerald Ford's presidency. In a 1976 Maine Sunday Telegram interview, Mr. Chase joked that his title was "chiseler to the president."

For more than 30 years he worked about six hours a day in his small studio, a former garage in Wiscasset. The tools of his trade were drills, saws, mallets and about 100 different chisels.
He carved a wide range of species from all over the world, and completed an average of 12 sculptures a year. Sometimes he spent as many as eight months on a single large bird, such as an eagle, condor or heron.
The color and grain of wood he would use depended upon the species of bird he was carving. He favored walnut, ebony, maple, birch, rosewood and other close-grained hardwoods.
"It's the hand sanding that brings out the glory of the wood," he said in a 1990 Press Herald interview. "But it's damned monotonous work."
Nearly 400 of Mr. Chase's sculptures are held in private collections or are on display in museums throughout the country.
His bird No. 302, an American oyster catcher carved in black walnut, was displayed in the Oval Office of the White House during Gerald Ford's presidency. In a 1976 Maine Sunday Telegram interview, Mr. Chase joked that his title was "chiseler to the president."
Before he was a math instructor, he was a shipfitter at Bath Iron Works. He's also was a mathematical engineer for W.S. Burgess yacht designers.
An airplane and helicopter pilot, he ran the Brunswick Flying Service at Brunswick Naval Air Station after World War II, during the few years that the government temporarily closed the airport.
He traveled extensively throughout the world to film and observe birds for his work, and traveled to the headwaters of the Amazon River when he was 81. He had been several times to Africa, as well as India, Australia, Bali and Alaska. In 1990, his tally of the birds he had seen was up to 2,449.
Mr. Chase was recognized in 1984 as a "master of wild life artist" by the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Museum in Wausau, Wis., the first sculptor to receive this award.
Born in Boston, a son of Walter and Fannie Hubbard Chase, he graduated from St. Paul's School, and in 1930 from Harvard University with a bachelor's degree in mathematics.
During World War II, he was a lieutenant commander in the Navy and was an anti-submarine warfare instructor.
He was a member of the Century Association of New York City since 1958 and while at Longwood Day School in his youth, received the certificate of neatness for 1918-1919.
In earlier years, he was active in the Brunswick Skating Club. He was an avid reader and loved nature, art, fishing, the Boston Red Sox, Harvard football and people.
He was formerly married to Georgianna Pratt Chase of Scarborough.
Surviving are a son, Charles D. of Portland;a sister, Judith C. Churchill of Princeton, N.J.; and a nephew, Jack Churchill of Camden.
A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday at St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Pleasant Street. The Rev. Ellen Shaver will officiate. Arrangements are by Brackett Funeral Home.

Abstract: Maine's environmental regulators have done a poor job of controlling toxic chemical discharges into the state's rivers, according to a new study by the Natural Resources Council of Maine. The study found that the Department of Environmental Protection often allows sewage-treatment plants and industries to discharge wastewater with relatively high levels of lead, copper, mercury or other toxic substances. Maine passed a law in 1994 that requires sewage plants and industries to test their wastewater for 126 toxic compounds, including dioxin, PCBs, pesticides, and heavy metals such as copper, lead and mercury.

Full text: Maine's environmental regulators have done a poor job of controlling toxic chemical discharges into the state's rivers, according to a new study by the Natural Resources Council of Maine.
The study found that the Department of Environmental Protection often allows sewage-treatment plants and industries to discharge wastewater with relatively high levels of lead, copper, mercury or other toxic substances.
The findings are important because high levels of certain toxic chemicals already have been found in Casco Bay and some other coastal waters.
If the toxic releases aren't reduced at the plants, advocates say, wildlife could suffer and people who eat fish, lobsters, clams or other shellfish could be exposed.
DEP Commissioner Ned Sullivan acknowledged in a written statement that the toxics testing program "had some real problems." He said the department was committed to solving them and helping the plants comply with the law.
Martha Kirkpatrick, chief of the DEP's water-quality bureau, said the department already has taken steps to correct many of the deficiencies.
Maine passed a law in 1994 that requires sewage plants and industries to test their wastewater for 126 toxic compounds, including dioxin, PCBs, pesticides, and heavy metals such as copper, lead and mercury.
If the tests show that toxic chemicals in wastewater exceed federal standards, the DEP is required to change the plant's state license to require it to control the pollution.
In a study that reviewed test results from 1995 and 1996, the Natural Resources Council found numerous problems with the testing program:
Thirty-six of the state's 73 municipal sewage plants and 11 of 21 industries - including paper mills, tanneries and electronics manufacturers - were releasing excess levels of toxic chemicals. The most common substances were heavy metals such as lead, zinc, copper, arsenic, silver, aluminum and mercury.
In 1995, nearly a third of all the plants failed to submit some or all of the required tests. In 1996, inadeqate testing was done at one-quarter of the plants. The DEP failed to require the plants to do more testing.
Many of the test results were found to be unreliable, and simply could not detect the presence of toxic chemicals at the levels required by law. As a result, the DEP couldn't be sure whether violations were occurring at those plants.
In Falmouth, the sewage-treatment plant recorded eight tests with copper levels at concentrations ranging from 9 to 31 parts per billion. That's three to 10 times the permitted concentration in the Presumpscot River.
Another sewage plant, in Yarmouth, was discharging waste with 30 parts per billion of silver - 30 percent over the limit for the Royal River.
Control Devices, an electronics plant in Standish, was discharging waste with 130 parts per billion of aluminum, twice the level permitted in the Little River, a tributary of the Presumpscot.
At the DEP, Kirkpatrick said the department didn't have enough staff to run the program correctly.
"This required a level of effort and a level of training that I underestimated," she said. "So did a lot of other people."
To address the problems, the DEP has shifted more staff members to work on the program. The agency has begun a full review of all the plant licenses.
The department also will adopt procedures to make sure all the required tests are conducted and all violations are addressed, Kirkpatrick said.
Industries release the toxic chemicals mostly as a byproduct of their production processes. At sewage plants, the chemicals are probably coming from sources located throughout the communities they serve.
Copper, for example, could come from corroding plumbing. Silver may enter the system from photo labs or schools.
Because the tests are normally done only once a year, it can be difficult to tell whether the toxic chemicals are flowing continuously into the rivers. So it's hard to tell whether the chemicals are causing significant damage.
In Casco Bay, however, elevated levels of heavy metals have been found in sediments and mollusks - especially near the mouth of the Presumpscot River.
And that river carries waste from several treatment plants and industries that discharge heavy metals like copper and lead in their wastewater. ____________________________________________________________________ ____

Abstract: Bob Houston clicks his mouse on a map of Maquoit Bay and the shoreline is suddenly awash in orange and pink, with big splotches of red splashed liberally around the coastline. Houston, a biologist and geographic information systems specialist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is demonstrating a valuable new tool for town planners, land trusts and science teachers. It's a CD rom that pinpoints all of the important coastal wildlife habitat in the 15 towns surrounding Casco Bay, and ranks it in importance. The maps include data on feeding and wintering habitats for waterbirds, shorebirds, seabirds and wading birds. They tell which streams and rivers are best for freshwater and river-spawning fish. They pinpoint the locations of marine worm and shellfish harvest areas. And they show which spots are ideal for bald eagle nesting sites.

Here, in the upper reaches of the Maquoit Bay, are some good feeding areas for endangered piping plovers.
Houston, a biologist and geographic information systems specialist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is demonstrating a valuable new tool for town planners, land trusts and science teachers. It's a CD rom that pinpoints all of the important coastal wildlife habitat in the 15 towns surrounding Casco Bay, and ranks it in importance.
It covers an area from Cape Elizabeth to Phippsburg and reaches as far inland as Pownal and North Yarmouth.
This collection of computerized maps could make it much easier to decide where to put that new subdivision on the outskirts of town. Conservationists can use it to figure out which parcel of woodlands or snippet of shoreline they should save with their limited number of dollars.
"It's great for a teacher up in Cumberland who wants to work with his kids on data that's in their own back yard," Houston said. "It makes it much more real for them."
The idea for the mapping program grew out of the Casco Bay Estuary Project, which identified loss of wildlife habitat in this region as a major concern.
The maps include data on feeding and wintering habitats for waterbirds, shorebirds, seabirds and wading birds. They tell which streams and rivers are best for freshwater and river-spawning fish. They pinpoint the locations of marine worm and shellfish harvest areas. And they show which spots are ideal for bald eagle nesting sites.
The maps can be laid over each other with a click of the mouse. Click the word "Canada goose" on a map of the Back Cove area in Portland, for example, and the bird's feeding and wintering habitat lights up along the edges of the cove.
Then click on "Eider duck," and the duck's feeding habitat just north and south of Mackworth Island appears, too.
The computer maps were built using the best information that researchers have, but that doesn't mean the data is perfect.
For some rare creatures, such as piping plovers and least terns, biologists have been compiling detailed maps of nesting areas along the Maine coast for years. Getting that information was easy.
But other data had to be dug out of old reports, or fished out of scientists' cabinet drawers.
In other cases, biologists at the Fish and Wildlife Service's Gulf of Maine Project used the characteristics of the landscape to project which areas might be valuable habitat for certain species.
"We know that a great blue heron likes to feed in mud flats, and it has the capability to feed in mud flats of a certain depth," said Stewart Fefer, the project leader. "So using the environmental data, we could project where the mudflats were of that depth range, and then we could project that as habitat for the heron."
The maps also rank the habitat by how important it is. Red signifies hotspots, places that are either valuable to many different species or of great importance to a single species - say, a bald eagle.
Orange means the habitat is of "medium value," and pink is reserved for spotsthat are of lesser value.
The maps also identify a yellow "sensitivity zone" immediately surrounding the important habitats where development could be damaging to wildlife.
The maps will give town planners, conservation commissions and land trusts a more rational method of finding out where development should be controlled or conservation money spent.
Got a federal grant to protect waterbirds? Click on common loon, Canada goose and black duck to see where they like to hang out.
Want to buy a parcel of land for a city park? Why not buy a piece that's home to five or six different wildlife species rather than just one or two?
Better yet, talk to neighboring towns and start linking up protected lands to form a larger wildlife corridor and recreation area.
Holly Dominie, a consultant working with the Freeport Conservation Commission on its new open space plan, used the new maps to find out if there was a pattern of valuable resource areas in the town.
Dominie and her staff added deer wintering yards to the wildlife maps. Then they overlayed the wildlife maps with a map of working farms and fields, and a map that showed shoreland areas and wetland buffers.
Then they assigned points to the resource areas based on whether they had low, medium or high value. They discovered that there are about 1,200 acres of valuable open space in Freeport, which represents just 5 percent of the town.
Dominie is using the maps to get specific recommendations from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife about which parts of Freeport should be conserved for wildlife and for hunting.
The Freeport Conservation Commission and Freeport Conservation Trust will use the information to think about what land should be acquired next and which landowners should be encouraged to have easements on their property.
"It's not just conserving land willy-nilly around town as the opportunity arises," Dominie said. "It's thinking out a rational, long-term system so you have all the areas connected to one another, and the wildlife can move back and forth and the people can have trails."
Biologists who have worked on the maps say they're also a good reminder that things are still relatively unspoiled here in Maine.
"I think that's a big message here," said Stewart Fefer of the Fish and Wildlife Service. "We still have a lot of things in Casco Bay that a little bit farther south, they're spending millions to restore."

Abstract: The building has been unchanged for the recent re-opening. Most of the dining room space is upstairs, with seating for a dozen or so patrons downstairs. The downstairs arrangement is awkward when people are waiting. You feel like people are on top of you, inspecting your food and waiting for you to be on your way so they can have your seat. In nice weather, a charming patio and private garden are open behind the building as well as a second-floor, outdoor deck with garden view. When the entrees arrived, we were already quite full. But who could resist the crab-stuffed filet mignon ($18.95) that was presented to me? This generous center cut of Angus tenderloin was char-grilled, as I had requested. It was stuffed with Maine crab meat and asparagus tips and was finished with a rich bernaise sauce. The presentation was dramatic, and the portion was huge. Also served on the oversized charger were roasted red bliss potatoes and a stir fry vegetable medley of zucchini, onion, eggplant, mushroom, tomato and green pepper. The vegetables were tossed with dried herbs and were too heavy with thyme for my taste. Other entrees included Pernod garden scampi ($15.95), a sautee of tiger shrimp in olive oil, garlic and herbs with julienned vegetables with a hint of Pernod and served over lemon-pepper linguini; poached Atlantic salmon ($14.95), a fresh filet poached in Riesling wine with a touch of garlic; chicken marsala ($13.95), a full breast quartered, floured, sauteed and deglazed with marsal, oyster mushroom and herbs; and vegetable primevera ($12.95), asparagus, eggplant, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil and herbs served over linguini.

Opened originally in 1990, Bintliff's has undergone many changes. This small restaurant across from the Post Office in Portland burned in November 1995 and was renovated in the Greek Revival style, reopening in January 1997. It closed seven months later.
In September 1997, it made its latest comeback, as Bintliff's American Cafe.

In nice weather, a charming patio and private garden are open behind the building as well as a second-floor, outdoor deck with garden view.
I'm happy to report that the food is as great as ever and the service has improved dramatically. Roger Bintliff, the owner and chef, is in full-time residence. And he's cooking up a creative storm in the open kitchen on the first floor.
Dinner is now served only on Friday and Saturday evenings; breakfast and lunch are served seven days a week. The dinner menu changes monthly, and specials are sometimes offered.
The night we visited, it was between holidays, and the restaurant was enjoying a steady pace but wasn't jammed. We were seated at a cozy table by a window on the second floor. This provided both a view of the street and a private spot to slowly enjoy dinner. A lamp on each table cast a warm and intimate glow.
Our server, who provided appropriate attention to our needs along with presenting a professional demeanor, was outstanding.
We were presented with an impressive wine list as well as choices from the full bar. When I asked if they had eggnog, I was delighted to find that the answer was yes.
Drinks in hand, we perused the menu. Four appetizers and two soups were offered in prices ranging from $2.95 to $6.95. Salads are not included with entrees, but two choices were offered - Caesar ($3.95) and mesculin ($2.95). Nine entrees were offered ranging from $12.95 to $18.95.
To begin, I ordered the signature crab and scallop bisque ($3.75). This oversized bowl of rich soup was thick with crab and scallop meat. It had a pureed consistency and a slightly spicy bite. It was garnished with finely minced parsley and easily could have served two.
My companion had the handmade wild mushroom ravioli ($6.95). It was sauteed with olive oil, basil and garlic. The pasta was al dente, and the mushroom stuffing was a creamy puree with an intensely dark color and flavor. It was served on an oversized charger with grated cheese, parsley and olive oil. It was divine and a meal in itself.
Other appetizers included salmon and roasted red pepper quesadillas with a spicy salsa and sour cream ($6.95); escargot in garlic butter with a pastry lattice ($5.95); and Maine crab-stuffed mushrooms in a sherried crab sauce ($5.95).
While waiting for our salad, we sampled the bread. It was homemade, twisted into shape, brushed with egg and dusted with herbs. It was served with whipped butter.
We shared an enormous plate of mesculin greens and garnishes ($2.95). It was one of the best salads I have ever eaten. The assorted fresh greens were liberally dotted with roasted shallots, raw cashews and coarsely grated parmesan cheese. The finishing flourish was balsamic vinaigrette applied with a prudent hand. The combination was dazzling. And it was so large we couldn't eat it all.
When the entrees arrived, we were already quite full. But who could resist the crab-stuffed filet mignon ($18.95) that was presented to me? This generous center cut of Angus tenderloin was char-grilled, as I had requested. It was stuffed with Maine crab meat and asparagus tips and was finished with a rich bernaise sauce. The presentation was dramatic, and the portion was huge. Also served on the oversized charger were roasted red bliss potatoes and a stir fry vegetable medley of zucchini, onion, eggplant, mushroom, tomato and green pepper. The vegetables were tossed with dried herbs and were too heavy with thyme for my taste.
My companion ordered the mixed grill ($17.95). A char-grilled double-thick pork chop, braised Atlantic salmon and grilled marinated lemon herb breast of chicken were served with a trio of sauces - a garlicky pesto, rich bernaise and Calvados, an apple brandy. The meat and fish were cooked perfectly, though the chicken was underdone. The server removed it and returned with a freshly cooked portion. The plate also contained the bliss potatoes and vegetables. The dish could have fed a family of four.
Other entrees included Pernod garden scampi ($15.95), a sautee of tiger shrimp in olive oil, garlic and herbs with julienned vegetables with a hint of Pernod and served over lemon-pepper linguini; poached Atlantic salmon ($14.95), a fresh filet poached in Riesling wine with a touch of garlic; chicken marsala ($13.95), a full breast quartered, floured, sauteed and deglazed with marsal, oyster mushroom and herbs; and vegetable primevera ($12.95), asparagus, eggplant, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, olive oil and herbs served over linguini.
There were only two dessert choices the evening we visited. I selected the cheesecake ($3.50) served in a pool of Bailey's Irish Creme sauce. The light cheesecake was encased in a tasty graham cracker crust. It was topped with a deep chocolate mousse and garnished with dollops of whipped cream. It was extravagant.
My companion chose the dessert crepe with fresh fruit ($3.50). This enormous, fluffy crepe was filled with two varieties of melon, fresh pineapple and banana flavored with Sambuca. The whole beautiful affair was dusted with confectioner's sugar.
Our bill, excluding tax, tip and drinks, was $55.

SURF SCOTER A SIGHT TO BEHOLD ON WINTER COASTAL WATERS ITS BOLD HEAD PATTERN AND MULTICOLORED BILL STAND OUT.

Full text: No other bird of North Atlantic winter coasts is patterned like the surf scoter. Large white spots on the head fore and aft, a white eye and a large, bright orange, white and black bill contrasting smartly with dull black body plumage make the male a sight to remember. Both the male and the dusky brown female appear all dark at any distance, though a pair of binoculars can pick out the white on the male's head from 0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile) away.
A bird of the breaking surf as its name implies, it also comes into the bays and coves of both coasts to spend the winter. On the East Coast, where its breeding grounds range from Labrador to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, it heads south for the cold-weather months to points from the Bay of Fundy to Florida.
In Maine, the surf scoter can be observed close-up at such favored places as the Peaks Island ferry landing in Casco Bay. Elsewhere along the coast, it often can be seen diving into the surf for the mollusks and crustaceans it prefers.
Wherever it is seen, one is unlikely to forget the encounter.

Full text: One day last month, six lobstermen from York drove to the Kittery Town Landing to find William Crawford and his son Michael.
The confrontation quickly turned violent.
The men, familiar rivals on the ocean, punched and wrestled each other on the driveway to the landing. When Kittery police officers arrived, William Crawford was getting pulled out of his truck while one man pounded in its windows with a baseball bat.
The six men from York are scheduled to be arraigned in York District Court on Tuesday on charges of assault. The case goes deeper than a simple brawl, however.
It was the culmination of a feud that's simmered for years in the waters off southern York County. And, in a sense, it's rooted in a collision between the traditional view of a vast and limitless ocean and the modern pressures of a public resource that's overused and overcrowded.
"The ocean's getting pretty small. It's hard to believe, but it is, and it's creating some tension," said Lt. Dan Morris of the Maine Marine Patrol.
Both sides of the Nov. 7 Kittery brawl have yet to tell their stories, but the general circumstances are familiar to marine officials. The York men accused the Crawfords of cutting away buoys marking their lobster traps, according to investigators and William Crawford, the only one involved who could be reached and would comment.
Crawford denies cutting the traps and said the dispute goes back decades about who can fish where. "It's a territorial thing," said Crawford. "They want to draw imaginary lines out there."
The fight is just one of the recent skirmishes that testify to growing tensions and fading civility on the ocean off Maine's coast. Points of friction range from the standoff between Monhegan Island and Friendship lobstermen to the slashed tires of an outsider who was digging oysters off Harpswell.
Morris said marine patrol officers now spend most of their time preventing, mediating or investigating conflicts that rarely erupted a decade ago. "They've increased over the last six or seven years substantially," he said. "It's all about competition."
It's an important issue for more than just people who fish. Along with the costs of keepingpeace and allocating public resources, some see the conflicts as a sign of a failure to manage the ocean and part of a painful transition away from a system of open access to marine resources.
Quahog Bay turf battle
Tom Howell found himself in a typical turf battle last month.
Howell runs Spinney Creek Shellfish in Eliot, and on Nov. 24 was in a small boat just off the Harpswell shore in Quahog Bay. He and a crew were using long-handled rakes to dig oysters from the bottom.
Howell says alocal man circled menacingly in his larger boat and then yelled at Howell to stay away. When Howell got back to his truck, his tires were slashed, he said.
The Cumberland County Sheriff's Department is investigating. Howell, meanwhile, went back for more oysters.
"These are public resources. I refuse to be intimidated by these guys who think this is mine and not yours," he said. "I just wish all the fishermen would . . . just acknowledge that's the way our country works."
Indeed, the country was set up so that the ocean would be open to everybody. Once, the resource seemed to be inexhaustible. Now that system is straining.
While increasing in number, there have long been conflicts between free access and territorial control of Maine's ocean.
In his book, "Lobster Gangs of Maine," University of Maine anthropology professor James Acheson writes of lobstermen sinking boats and burning fish shacks to protect territory.
"You've always had these gear conflicts," said Acheson. "I just think there's more people now. . . . You do have an escalation of all kinds of gear in the water. You've got more traps. You've got a lot more fishermen."
And you've got fewer fish.
Overfishing of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder has shifted pressure to other species: urchins, shrimp, lobster.
Now those species also are being depleted or, in the case of lobster, are still plentiful but facing new restrictions because of record-high fishing pressure.
"There are a number of fisheries where there's just a lot of strain right now," said Robin Alden, who recently resigned as Maine's Commissioner of Marine Resources. "It's really stress. That's what you're seeing."
Because of the pressures, traditional fishing has become more aggressive and more competitive.
There are now more than 2.5 million lobster traps in the waters off Maine's coast during the summer and fall, compared to about 1.8 million in 1985. Some lobstermen use more than 1,000 traps to compete for their share of the lobsters.
Meanwhile, fishermen who pull nets along the bottom for fish or shrimp have adapted to the depletion of traditional fishing grounds. They use rollers, or "rock hoppers," on their nets so they can fish over rocky areas that used to be safe haven for lobsters and lobster traps.
Draggers vs. lobstermen
Conflicts between draggers and lobstermen are now common.
The surface outside Casco Bay was dotted with brightly colored lobster buoys last September when the New England herring fleet arrived.
The boats, closed out of fishing grounds to the south, netted tons of the small fish and unloaded them into tanker trucks nightly on the Portland waterfront.
About 1,800 lobster traps disappeared during about three weeks - costing 20 to 30 lobstermen an estimated $80,000 in lost equipment. About 500 traps have been found, ruined, often more than a mile away.
Maine's Department of Marine Resources is still investigating. Although it is not illegal for a fishing boat to run over trapswhile it is trying to catch fish in an open area, the state tries to prevent conflicts from repeating.
"We can't afford to let them drive us (away from the lobsters) anymore," said Arthur "Sparky" Pierce, a lobsterman from Phippsburg who lost 80 traps.
Furious lobstermen called for banning rock-hoppers and keeping draggers and midwater trawlers farther offshore.
Fred Bayley of Scarborough owns two herring trawlers, and said they steer clear of traps because the conflicts hurt everybody.
But, he said, it's the lobstermen who are doing the driving. "Lobster catchers have so many traps. They go right into what we call dragger bottom. They claim it," he said. "Lobster catchers want to prevail over everything."
The pressures are changing the culture of fishing.
"When we got into fishing, we were told by the old people the proper ways to act. You never cut somebody else's line (when tangled up), you cut your own," said Pierce. "If I ran over a buoy and no one was around to see it, I'd call the guy and tell him and offer to pay for it."
There is less respect for each others' gear now, according to Pierce and others.
"I see the gentleman part of the business fading fast," said Morris of the Marine Patrol.
Some see a measure of relief in efforts by Maine's lobster industry to limit the number of traps to as few as 800 or 600 per boat along some parts of the coast. That would ease crowding, but only if the Legislature prevents other lobstermen from putting additional traps in the same areas.
The state has responded by stepping up patrols when conflicts are foreseen. This week, patrol officers will watch the shrimp fleet, which is sure to follow shrimp inshore in the coming days and potentially run into lobster traps.
Officers also try to mediate disputes, and sometimes moderate meetings between competing groups to set up unofficial boundaries.
One conflict in particular has demanded lots of state resources this winter.
Five lobstermen from Friendship, complaining of crowding in their lobster grounds, got state permits to trap lobsters in the waters around Monhegan Island. Islanders considered the incursion into their territory as a threat to the community and a slap in the face of 100 years of local control and conservation.
The marine patrol and Coast Guard have been watching closely because of threats of a major "trap war" and rumors of violence. And top state officials helped negotiate a temporary boundary to allow peaceful lobster trapping.
So far, both sides are catching a lot of lobsters and not fighting, said Morris, of the marine patrol. "That kind of takes the edge off the tension."
Lawmakers are expected to take up the Monhegan conflict in January, perhaps protecting Monhegan's traditional territory with a landmark law to limit access to the ocean there.
Acheson, the anthropologist, sees the Monhegan dispute as part of the debate about whether the ocean can remain an open-access public resource.
"You've got two groups of lobster fishermen that are arguing, in essence, how do we go into the future," he said.
"To a large extent, what you're seeing is institutions designed for a very sparsely settled agricultural country, and we're trying to live with those at the end of the 20th century," said Acheson. "I think we need to come to the realization that . . . the proud tradition of open access to marine resources is probably coming to an end."
If true, it's a volatile transition. And most observers foresee more conflictsflaring up like the brawl last month in Kittery.
"It's got more violent," said William Crawford. "There's going to be more and more trouble." -------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ FOR LINKS to Internet information on the state of fishing in Maine, go to the Press Herald's World Wide Web site: www.portland.com "(Conflicts have) increased over the last six or seven years substantially. . . .

Abstract: The Clinton administration, responding to public alarm over the safety of meat and produce, will propose a significant increase in spending for food inspection and safety research in the budget to be presented to Congress early next year, administration officials have said. After a year that saw outbreaks of food-borne illnesses from tainted Guatemalan raspberries, Louisiana oysters and Midwestern ground beef, President Clinton is seeking an additional $71 million for food safety programs at the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "What we are trying to do is take the agencies that deal with food inspection from the 19th century to the 21st century," said a senior White House official, who insisted on anonymity because he was discussing figures that will not be officially released until February. "We are carrying out the first update of our food safety programs in 90 years."

Full text: The Clinton administration, responding to public alarm over the safety of meat and produce, will propose a significant increase in spending for food inspection and safety research in the budget to be presented to Congress early next year, administration officials have said.
After a year that saw outbreaks of food-borne illnesses from tainted Guatemalan raspberries, Louisiana oysters and Midwestern ground beef, President Clinton is seeking an additional $71 million for food safety programs at the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The proposed increases would continue a four-year trend of devoting additional public money to ensuring food safety. The increase, to a total of $817 million for all federal programs, represents a 9 percent increase in a year when the overall federal budget will grow 1 percent.
The money is being proposed in the budget for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.
Spending on food safety has increased more than 60 percent since Clinton took office in 1993.
"What we are trying to do is take the agencies that deal with food inspection from the 19th century to the 21st century," said a senior White House official, who insisted on anonymity because he was discussing figures that will not be officially released until February. "We are carrying out the first update of our food safety programs in 90 years."
Critics say the government is belatedly addressing a problem that has been growing worse for years because of an explosion of imports of fruits and vegetables and lax enforcement of existing laws governing hygiene at the feedlots, slaughterhouses and packinghouses.
Inspectors are overwhelmed by the volume of imports and scarce resources for inspecting tens of thousands of processing centers, the critics say.
"It is good that they are funding new inspectors for overseas, but they haven't begun to grapple with the fact that they need new inspectors for domestic produce and seafood," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group here. "The money for the FDA, in particular, is minimal and really a drop in the bucket compared to what they really need to improve the FDA's food program."
Administration officials responded that Congress trimmed spending for FDA food inspectors in the final hours of budget negotiations in the fall and that the new money would help bring the inspection staff up to authorized levels.
The number of inspectors at the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service dropped to 7,500 at the beginning of 1997 from 12,000 in 1978. The Food and Drug Administration entered the current year with fewer than 700 inspectors.
Last year, Clinton announced the most sweeping changes in meat inspection since the government created the system at the beginning of the century, when Upton Sinclair chronicled abuses in "The Jungle." The new rules called for replacing old "poke and sniff" inspections with scientifically based tests.
This year, the president proposed a broad initiative that combines aggressive inspection with new tools to detect outbreaks of food-borne illnesses before they become widespread.
Pathogens carried in food are responsible for up to 30 million cases of illness and 9,000 deaths a year, officials report. The problem was dramatized in 1993 by the deaths of four children in the Northwest from eating undercooked Jack-in-the-Box hamburgers contaminated with the E. coli 0157:H7 bacteria.
This year, a major processor recalled 25 million pounds of hamburger after 17 people in Colorado got food poisoning from meat tainted with the E. coli.
No amount of federal inspection, of course, can prevent food from becoming tainted in the home if it is not properly refrigerated or is otherwise mishandled.
Under the administration spending plan, $41 million would go to the Agriculture Department to improve testing of meat and poultry for unseen contaminants like E. coli and salmonella, bringing the department's total spending on food inspection to $647 million in 1999. The department's inspectors would begin to use new scientific tools to detect pathogens in meat.
The department would also provide educational material to the elderly, who have the highest risk of illness from food-borne bacteria, and to workers in school cafeterias. Thousands of children become sick each year from poor handling of food in school lunches.
Food inspection at the Food and Drug Administration would receive a $25 million increase, to $150 million, mostly for surveillance of imported fruits and vegetables, a growing source of contaminants. Though food imports to the United States have doubled in the past decade, inspections of those imports by the FDA have fallen by more than half.
Officials said the additional money would help add up to 100 new inspectors, who would be sent to examine farming overseas, including the use of fertilizers and pesticides, as well as safety systems.
The proposal would also add $5 million for the CDC to hire new scientists and buy new equipment to detect food-borne diseases. The increase would put the agency's food safety budget at $20 million.
"The idea is to target resources to the areas of highest risk - children, the elderly - and to try to identify the critical points where contamination can occur," an administration official said. "Once we figure out where the worst risks of contamination are, how pathogens build through the system, that's where we'll devote more of the resources."
DeWaal welcomed the plans for additional resources for food safety but questioned whether the administration could continue to address the problem in such a fragmented way, with authority divided among three federal agencies and dozens of state programs.
She said she was particularly concerned about the FDA's ability to carry out its inspection duties. The agency's 700 inspectors and laboratory workers must monitor 53,000 domestic plants.
"The additional money for USDA and the CDC sounds appropriate to me," DeWaal said. "My concern is that the FDA budget is still way too small. The Clinton administration has really embraced food safety as a banner issue, and that's good. But it would be a shame if their legacy as they leave office is that they've left the FDA's food program weaker." "What we are trying to do is take the agencies that deal with food inspection from the 19th century to the 21st century." Senior official at White House

Abstract: Every seafood processor must follow strict new rules starting Thursday to keep tainted fish from reaching Americans. The long-awaited rules mark the first industrywide test of a touted safety program that the government plans to expand into other foods, starting with meats next month. And because half the seafood eaten in the United States is imported, FDA inspectors will monitor seafood importers for the first time, even send inspectors into some foreign plants, to make sure they meet safety standards. Under the new rules, every seafood plant must follow a customized plan designed to prevent bad seafood from reaching consumers. Called HACCP, which stands for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points, plants identify every point where contamination could occur and prove that they took proper preventive steps at these points, providing a continual safety record.

Full text: Every seafood processor must follow strict new rules starting Thursday to keep tainted fish from reaching Americans.
Hoping to prevent up to 60,000 seafood poisonings a year, the government is requiring processors to prove they do everything from buying only clean, fresh fish off boats to forcing employees to wash their hands.
"There's not a moment when you can let your guard down," said Dr. Michael Friedman, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
The long-awaited rules mark the first industrywide test of a touted safety program that the government plans to expand into other foods, starting with meats next month. And because half the seafood eaten in the United States is imported, FDA inspectors will monitor seafood importers for the first time, even send inspectors into some foreign plants, to make sure they meet safety standards.
But consumer advocates say the rules aren't enough, because the FDA won't police fishing boats or retail stores. The question is how effective each seafood plant proves at fighting contamination.
"It's going to take a couple of years before we see . . . if the rules really have an impact," said Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
The FDA actually wrote the new rules two years ago, but gave seafood plants until Thursday to comply.
About 9,000 Americans die every year from food poisoning, but no one knows how many deaths are caused by tainted fish. The FDA estimates 114,000 Americans are sickened by bad seafood each year and that the new rules will prevent up to 60,000 of them.
Seafood is vulnerable to pollution, viruses, bacteria, even natural toxins that emerge if the fish isn't properly chilled. Until now, the FDA had only a snapshot of safety during annual or biannual plant inspections, with no way to know how the food was handled after inspectors left.
Under the new rules, every seafood plant must follow a customized plan designed to prevent bad seafood from reaching consumers. Called HACCP, which stands for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points, plants identify every point where contamination could occur and prove that they took proper preventive steps at these points, providing a continual safety record.
FDA inspectors will visit some 3,800 seafood plants in the next year to ensure they are complying. The agency initially will help plants whose HACCP plans don't appear safe enough to improve them, but later violations will be prosecuted.
The risks differ by species, but the first "critical point" is the docks.
Any processor buying tuna or marlin, for instance, must ensure the boat adequately chilled the fish and didn't stay at sea too long, because scombroid poisoning can occur once those species even slightly decompose, said FDA seafood chief Philip Spiller.
"If those assurances can't be provided, go elsewhere," he warned seafood plants.
Back at the plant, there are different risks. Precooked seafood such as crabmeat must be cooked at a hot enough temperature and refrigerated quickly to prevent bacterial growth, explained Thomas Rippen of the Maryland Sea Grant Program, who spent months teaching HACCP classes for seafood workers.
Ultimately, HACCP isn't that cumbersome, said Carol Haltaman, president of the John T. Handy Co. in Crisfield, Md., who bought better thermometers and hired a quality-control manager to ready the small crab plant. HACCP will cost Handy just half a cent a crab, she said.
But the rules stop short of forcing seafood plants to test their products for pathogens, such as the Vibrio vulnificus that has killed 24 people who ate tainted raw oysters this year, consumer advocate DeWaal said. She is pushing the FDA to require plants that sell raw oysters to pasteurize them.
The FDA is considering whether that is necessary, and is preparing additional safety guidelines for fishing boats.
"There will be changes that occur: new hazards, new solutions, new checkpoints," Friedman said. But for now, the HACCP rules "make common sense, they make scientific sense." PREVENTION PLAN
Under the new federal rules, every seafood plant must follow a customized plan designed to prevent bad seafood from reaching consumers.
Called HACCP, which stands for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points, plants identify every point where contamination could occur and prove that they took proper preventive steps at these points, providing a continual safety record.

Abstract: It would be a shame, after all this time, if we allowed a few to rule for the majority. The large majority of Maine citizens showed their support for the amendment to the Maine Human Rights Act by not signing the citizens' veto petition and by electing the legislators and the governor who passed and signed the law. It is a dangerous situation to allow a minority group such as the Christian Civic League to dictate civil rights in Maine. This is what happened in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust resulted. The way to prevent this is to get out and vote "no" on Feb.10. I justhope that the people also take the time to look into the issues for themselves and not just vote blindly the way Gov. King and the press urge them to on the referendum to repeal the gay rights law early next year. That is also a complicated law with consequences for our state far more important and far-reaching than the forestry compact. Thank you.

Full text:   More discussion of gay rights vote on Feb. 10
Thank you for your lead editorial on Sunday, Nov. 30, which was direct and to the point. It is extremely important for all people who are opposed to discrimination to get out and vote on Feb. 10.
It would be a shame, after all this time, if we allowed a few to rule for the majority. The large majority of Maine citizens showed their support for the amendment to the Maine Human Rights Act by not signing the citizens' veto petition and by electing the legislators and the governor who passed and signed the law.
It is a dangerous situation to allow a minority group such as the Christian Civic League to dictate civil rights in Maine. This is what happened in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust resulted. The way to prevent this is to get out and vote "no" on Feb.10.

I WOULD LIKE to congratulate the people of Maine on their vote on the governor's forestry compact last month.
That was a complicated issue and there was a lot of propaganda put out by Gov. King and the press. However, rather than blindly voting the way Gov. King and the press were urging people to vote, people took the time to study the issues and voted the way they thought would be best for the state. That is the only way a democracy like ours can work.
I justhope that the people also take the time to look into the issues for themselves and not just vote blindly the way Gov. King and the press urge them to on the referendum to repeal the gay rights law early next year. That is also a complicated law with consequences for our state far more important and far-reaching than the forestry compact. Thank you.

TWO LETTERS in the Maine Sunday Telegram (Dec. 7) by persons favoring the repeal of the law protecting the civil rights of gays contain some specious arguments.
Christopher Ritter argues that homosexuality is a matter of choice (debatable) and therefore should not be covered by anti-discrimination legislation. By his logic, religion, which is also a matter of choice, should also be excluded from our civil rights laws. Of course, the exclusion of religion might turn Maine into another Northern Ireland or Bosnia, but that's the price of freedom to discriminate.
Bill Corish argues because some employers consider homosexuality to be "sinful" and may reflect on an applicant's "character" (and thus job performance), he should have the "right to refuse employment."
But the civil rights laws have been written to protect individuals against such stereotyped assumptions about an individual's behavior or character on the basis of group affiliation. To follow Mr. Corish's argument to its logical conclusion, the moralistic employer should also examine closely the sexual behavior of his heterosexual applicants.
He should refuse to hire any divorced persons (they may have been unfaithful in marriage); reject any applicants who admit to having sex outside of marriage (the sin of lust). He might also reject applicants who drink (they might become drunkards); reject all overweight applicants (guilty of gluttony); and all well-dressed applicants (sin of vanity).
Our nation's strength comes from our tolerance of diversity, which we have incorporated, when necessary, in our laws. Gays have suffered demonstrably from violent prejudice and discrimination and thus deserve protection under our civil rights laws.

RECENTLY, TWO letter writers argued that "special status" should extend only to those "groups" exhibiting "factors" that are in-born or "acquired without choice" and that "bosses" have the "right" to refuse employment to those whose "behavior" they find "immoral."
These writers have carefully neglected to mention that "religion," too, is a protected category, one that is "freely chosen" and "behavior-based," involving rituals and rites that "illustrate an individual's character."
Say, for example, that persons A and B work together packing boxes. A is a biblical literalist whereas B loves to eat lobster in spite of "several very clear biblical references" condemning the eating of shellfish as an "abomination." No matter how reprehensible A finds B, or vice versa, neither has done anything to disqualify him or her from packing boxes.
Therefore, a boss who is a biblical literalist cannot fire B simply for eating lobster and a boss who eats lobster cannot fire A for attending services to pray that God smite B for ignoring Mosaic law. Neither activity has anything to do with packing boxes.
There is, though, a "freely chosen" behavior that adversely affects how people pack boxes and that clearly has no place on the job site. It is wrong because it attempts to deny people jobs on the basis of "factors" that have nothing to do with packing boxes. That behavior is called discrimination and it should remain illegal.

Correction
A sentence in Christopher Ritter's letter last week on gay rights and the Feb. 10 referendum should have read: "If Maine voters think it's important to keep the government out of private nonviolent disagreements about freely chosen behavior, they will have a chance to say so."

Abstract: Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline's willingness to adjust its plans marks a new level of cooperation with a community that felt its concerns were being ignored. The pipeline is a 12-mile offshoot of a 630-mile line that Maritimes and Northeast wants to build from Nova Scotia to Dracut, Mass. Proposals for the offshoot and other sections of the pipeline have angered residents in several Maine towns besides Yarmouth, including Richmond and Cumberland. Residents have opposed the route the pipeline would take through their communities and have criticized Maritimes and Northeast, saying the company has not addressed their concerns.

Full text: A company that has proposed building a natural-gas pipeline to Cousins Island has adjusted its construction plan so that it won't have to cut as many trees.
The changes are a response to complaints from island residents, who have sent hundreds of letters to the company, the state Legislature and Congress claiming the tree-clearing would scar the island landscape.
Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline's willingness to adjust its plans marks a new level of cooperation with a community that felt its concerns were being ignored.
But the changes, which primarily involve shifting the location of the pipeline 10 feet, might not be enough to eliminate the community's anger.
The company will discuss its plans at a meeting at 7 tonight at Yarmouth High School and at a meeting at 5 p.m. Monday, also at Yarmouth High School.
"It's a step in the right direction," said Guy Vigue, a town councilor who lives on the island. "I think they are somewhat responsive to our concerns. We still have some work to do."
The pipeline is a 12-mile offshoot of a 630-mile line that Maritimes and Northeast wants to build from Nova Scotia to Dracut, Mass.
Proposals for the offshoot and other sections of the pipeline have angered residents in several Maine towns besides Yarmouth, including Richmond and Cumberland. Residents have opposed the route the pipeline would take through their communities and have criticized Maritimes and Northeast, saying the company has not addressed their concerns.
The 16-inch-wide offshoot pipe would connect the main line to the W.F. Wyman Power Station on Cousins Island.
The line would follow a Central Maine Power Co. line that runs down the center of the island. Maritimes and Northeast would have to cut hundreds of trees at the edge of the power line corridor, exposing the power lines and the clear cut to the island's main road and walking path.
In a letter to island residents dated Dec. 4, Maritimes and Northeast wrote that it has filed a request with federal regulators to move the pipe 10 feet closer to the center of the corridor. The shift would enable the company to leave more trees standing near the road and walking path.
The company also is looking at ways it can adjust its standard construction practices to save trees.
"We are trying to reduce substantially the impact of the tree-cutting," said Brian Prenda, a spokesman for Maritimes and Northeast. "So far the response to us working with the community has been really good."
Some opposition to the proposal will likely remain, however, because the company would still have to cut a lot of trees and because many residents don't want the pipeline anywhere on the island.
The solution most popular with the island community and town officials is to place the pipe underwater from the mainland to Wyman Station.
Maritimes and Northeast has considered an underwater route. But the Dec. 4 letter states that it is not the primary route "due to the adverse environmental impacts to the bay such as eelgrass beds, shellfish beds, lobster and other fisheries, harbor seals, roseate terns, etc."
Prenda said an underwater route is still a possibility, but it would require further study of the environmental impact.
Vigue said that study should be done. He said keeping the entire route underwater would not inflict much more damage than the current proposal to go partially underwater and partially on land.
"You're going to affect the sea environment regardless of which route you take," Vigue said. "And if you're going overland, you're going to disturb a heck of a lot of human life. I'd rather see some sea life disturbed."
Prenda said Maritimes and Northeast plans to continue to work on the issue with the community and hopes to reach a satisfactory solution for all sides by the end of January. "We are trying to reduce substantially the impact of the tree-cutting." Brian Prenda, spokesman, Maritimes and Northeast

FOR GRISSINI FARE, SERVICE - PUT ON YOUR GALOSHES AND GO

Abstract: The furnishings are sleek contemporary Italian design - chairs of woven black and tan rattan on bamboo frames and wildly oversized stemware. Black banquettes occupy one wall under oversized recessed windows. Mounted in the window casings are glass shelves lined with bottles of olive oils and preserved fruits. In daylight, it must create a stained glass effect. The tables are spaced well and create a sense of privacy in the room - each an oasis. The feeling is also helped along by the music. Pavarotti, Domingo and Caras dominate, taking turns singing serious opera and popular favorites like "O Sole Mio." The music is loud, booming at times. It resounds off the high ceiling, bare wood floors and glass walls. All the cooking is done on a wood-fired grill and the emphasis is on traditional and contemporary cuisine from the northern Italian/Tuscan region. The menu offers more than 45 choices, including hot and cold antipastos (appetizers and soups, $3.95 to $6.95), pizza ($6.25 to $7.95 small, $9.25 to $10.95large), salads (insalate, $4.50 to $5.95), pasta ($9.95 to $13.95) and other entrees (secondi, $11.95 to $13.95) and side dishes (contorni, $2.25 to $2.50). Vegetarian offerings are available in all the categories.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
When you visit Grissini, an Italian trattoria (restaurant), you will be transported to a world of good design and satisfying food.
The main dining room almost overwhelmed me. It is cavernous, with a high ceiling, exposed beams, ceiling fans, and a gigantic stone fireplace on one end of the room. There is also a bank of French doors that open onto a patio in good weather.
The center of the room is dominated by an enormous table heaped with baskets of fresh breads, bottles of wine, candle sconces and a flower arrangement that dramatically zooms 6 feet into the air.
The wooden floor is painted in a traditional black/white square pattern. The paint has begun to wear in the year and a half the restaurant has been open and that patina grounds the huge room.
The furnishings are sleek contemporary Italian design - chairs of woven black and tan rattan on bamboo frames and wildly oversized stemware. Black banquettes occupy one wall under oversized recessed windows. Mounted in the window casings are glass shelves lined with bottles of olive oils and preserved fruits. In daylight, it must create a stained glass effect.
The tables are spaced well and create a sense of privacy in the room - each an oasis. The feeling is also helped along by the music. Pavarotti, Domingo and Caras dominate, taking turns singing serious opera and popular favorites like "O Sole Mio." The music is loud, booming at times. It resounds off the high ceiling, bare wood floors and glass walls.
The stormy night we visited, we were seated next to the French doors. It was chilly, but we soon warmed up to the interesting and plentiful menu selections.
Our server, like all the Grissini wait staff, was dressed in a white shirt, black trousers and a long gray and white striped apron tied at the waist. She was extremely knowledgeable, going out of her way to answer our questions. She even went into the cooler to find the label on one of the cheeses. That same level of service was apparent throughout the restaurant.
Upon being seated, diners are offered the choice of ice water or Pellegrino ($6 liter), imported Italian spring water. There is a full bar on the lower level.
All the cooking is done on a wood-fired grill and the emphasis is on traditional and contemporary cuisine from the northern Italian/Tuscan region. The menu offers more than 45 choices, including hot and cold antipastos (appetizers and soups, $3.95 to $6.95), pizza ($6.25 to $7.95 small, $9.25 to $10.95large), salads (insalate, $4.50 to $5.95), pasta ($9.95 to $13.95) and other entrees (secondi, $11.95 to $13.95) and side dishes (contorni, $2.25 to $2.50). Vegetarian offerings are available in all the categories.
All the bread is homemade and is served directly on the white paper cover that tops the white linen on each table, with premium olive oil for dipping. The bread is also available to go.
To begin, I chose the butternut squash soup ($3.75). The bowl was enough to serve three. The soup had a cream base. The squash was mild and flavored with a bit of garlic and garnished with chives. It was pleasant but not exciting.
My companion had the torta di zucchine ($5.95). This layered tart of zucchini with parmesan and mozzarella cheeses and aioli was served cold. It was overly rich with cheese and too cold to appreciate.
Other choices include pagnotta ($3.95), warm rustic bread buttered with herbs and garlic; portabella alla griglia ($5.95), wood grilled portabella mushrooms drizzled with pesto; and zuppa d'orzo ($3.95), a hearty soup of barley, vegetables and pancetta.
We decided to share a salad and agreed on the insalata mista della casa ($4.50). The freshest mixed field greens, calamata olives, tomato, gorgonzola and wood oven roasted pine nuts combined for one of the best salads we've ever had. The gorgonzola was spectacular. It was a triple-cream base, and the pungent, distinctive flavor knocked us out. The dressing was just the right amount of balsamic vinaigrette, and the salad sizewas perfect for two.
Other salads include insalata di spinaci ($4.95), spinach salad with sun-dried tomato puree and pancetta vinaigrette; and caprese ($5.95), fresh tomato and mozzarella with basil, aged balsamic vinegar and XVOO cognac.
For an entree, I selected the bistecca d'agnello alla griglia ($13.95), a wood-grilled leg of lamb steak with Tuscan white beans, pancetta, black pepper, mild garlic and rosemary. It was outstanding. The lamb was tender, plentiful and beautifully seasoned. It was resting in a pool of tasty white beans enhanced by the pancetta. It was a great combination.
For a side dish, I tried the purea di patate ($2.25) mashed potatoes with garlic. They were any garlic-lover's fantasy - delightfully heady and a creamy consistency.
My companion had the pappardelle ai funghi ($11.95), wide ribbons of fresh pasta with shitake, oyster and portabella mushrooms tossed in a porcini chicken broth, XVOO and fresh herbs. The perfectly done pasta melted in your mouth. The mushrooms were plentiful and the broth mouthwatering. It was topped with aged parmesan. Since the bowl was so huge, it made a second meal the next day.
Other entrees include gnocchicon burro e salvia ($9.95), fresh potato dumplings in a creamy parmesan and sage sauce; fettuccine con pollo e basilico ($11.95), fresh fettuccine with wood-grilled chicken breast, pesto and brandied apples; anatra al miele ($13.50), roasted local duck breast and braised leg on a bed of baked tomato and eggplant; and salmone alla griglia ($12.95), grilled local salmon on creamy sweet potato polenta and spumante butter sauce.
Dessert was limited to three choices (each $5). Considering the meal, I opted for the fresh berries. A large dish of blueberries and strawberries was served with fresh whipped cream. My companion went for the chocolate terrine, three decadent wedges of deep rich chocolate, assembled like a piece of art. They were sitting in a puddle of vanilla cream sauce and garnished with toasted almonds. It was really over thetop. The other offering was tiramisu - ladyfingers soaked in espresso and covered with powdered chocolate and sweet cheese.
Our bill, excluding tax and tip, was $60.
A hot cup of excellent coffee made it easier to face the weather for our journey home. But we agreed: A return trip would be worth braving a dark and stormy night anytime.

Abstract: The Europeans who settled the shores of the Gulf of Maine had come for one reason: to fish. They had discovered what was, and still is, an enormously productive marine ecosystem, one of the most robust in the world. Maine is the fourth-largest seafood-producing state in the country. Our fishermen harvest some 60 species of marine finfish, shellfish, plants and invertebrates for an international marketplace. They work in our rich coastal environments and in waters hundreds of miles from home. In 1995, Maine's commercial landings were valued at $262 million, with Portland alone accounting for $66 million. The commercial fishing industry generated over 22,000 jobs, and is estimated to have contributed $487 million to Maine's economy. Total capital investment in commercial fishing and related infrastructure well exceeds $1 billion.

Full text: ABOUT THE AUTHOR John Williamson is a commercial fisherman who lives in Kennebunk.
The Europeans who settled the shores of the Gulf of Maine had come for one reason: to fish. They had discovered what was, and still is, an enormously productive marine ecosystem, one of the most robust in the world.
Maine is the fourth-largest seafood-producing state in the country. Our fishermen harvest some 60 species of marine finfish, shellfish, plants and invertebrates for an international marketplace. They work in our rich coastal environments and in waters hundreds of miles from home.
In 1995, Maine's commercial landings were valued at $262 million, with Portland alone accounting for $66 million. The commercial fishing industry generated over 22,000 jobs, and is estimated to have contributed $487 million to Maine's economy. Total capital investment in commercial fishing and related infrastructure well exceeds $1 billion.
COMMERCIAL fisheries are the bedrock of the economies of our coastal communities. Our fishermen are resourceful small-businessmen. More than tourism, more than logging, fishing is the defining industry of our state.
All this coming from a resource base that is, beyond all dispute, in crisis.
That is the wonder of it and the opportunity. If the marine resource was managed to its potential, to produce at a level of abundance that is within living memory, then the benefits would represent a huge return to Maine's economy.
Commissioner of Marine Resources Louise "Robin" Alden has resigned that office to be with her family. Those of us who have watched her routinely working 15-hour days, much of the time on the road or out of state, know what she sacrificed to do her job.
However,her departure also points to a shift in the commissioner's job. Marine fisheries once were healthy enough to take care of themselves with little tending. In recent years, with increased exploitation, that balance has changed. Past DMR commissioners have had to prioritize staff demands to concentrate on the more valuable species. That does not work any longer.
ALDEN ARRIVED at the DMR three years ago after a long involvement with the Maine fishing community. She clearly understood the interrelationship of all marine species, she recognized the importance of all the diverse fisheries that make up the whole, and she understood the complex interdependence between coastal communities and the marine system.
In her passion and commitment she has attempted to do what needed to be done rather than settle for what could be done within current budget and staff limits.
For someone with her depth and vision of what it takes to manage fisheries well, this has been an impossibly demanding job. She has set the benchmark. We hope that the next commissioner can continue to build on her ground-breaking work.
The United States does not manage its ocean resources well. Few countries do. The reasons for failure are many and we have much to learn.
Maine must be a leader in developing the methods, the system and the knowledge to protect and enhance the productivity of our marine environment. We cannot continue to depend on extraordinary efforts from our most talented people to get the job done.
ONE REASON we manage fisheries poorly is because we know so little. Maine is home to some world-class marine scientists; we need to attract more top-quality people by expanding research opportunities, creating a mandate for better science and the broadest possible database.
Maine should be the center for applied marine sciences on the East Coast. Additionally, we must foster an atmosphere of innovation within our fishing community; the responsibility of stewardship falls most heavily on them. The core of this industryis highly professional, and it must be fully integrated into the scientific and management spheres.
Take the example of Iceland, a barren island on the Arctic Circle. It is the size of Maine with a smaller population and few land-based resources. Seventy-five percent of the Icelandic economy is based on marine products. They confronted their "fisheries crisis" 15 years ago. Iceland now has the highest standard of living of all European countries.
Maine's operating budget for the DMR relies on state taxes for a little more than $7 million, with an additional $2 million coming from license fees and other revenue. That is not enough by any measure, but certainly not in comparison to the economic contribution of fisheries to this state, and especially not in consideration of the resource's potential yield.
Marine fisheries are our most renewable resource, if we invest in their growth. Not to do so is to fall further behind.

WHEN IT COMES TO QUAHOGS, HE'S A GENUINE MUCK-A-MUCK HARVESTER JIM MACLEOD OF BRUNSWICK FINDS THE MUDDY MOLLUSKS IN HIS OWN WET WAY.

Abstract: In his hooded wet suit, Jim MacLeod looks more like a deep-sea diver than a clam digger. MacLeod harvests quahogs, the large, thick-shelled clams distinctive to New England. While most quahog harvesters stand in a boat and rake the submerged mud flats, MacLeod ventures into the water himself. With his head above water, he combs for the clams by running his fingers through the squishy mud. He then tosses them in a shellfish basket floating in a black inner tube.

Full text: In his hooded wet suit, Jim MacLeod looks more like a deep-sea diver than a clam digger.
"Everybody knows who I am, though, because of the way I dig," the 53-year-old Brunswick man said recently.
MacLeod harvests quahogs, the large, thick-shelled clams distinctive to New England. While most quahog harvesters stand in a boat and rake the submerged mud flats, MacLeod ventures into the water himself.
With his head above water, he combs for the clams by running his fingers through the squishy mud. He then tosses them in a shellfish basket floating in a black inner tube.
MacLeod admits his style is unconventional. But it's also practical.
"I don't have a boat. All I have is a canoe and I knew I couldn't rake in a canoe," he said.
MacLeod has harvested on and off for 40 years, but this is the first year he's gone with the wet suit method. He used to have waders, but that got too cold.
"This time of year I wouldn't usually be digging because it's too cold. But now with the wet suit I can dig till the pond freezes over," he said.
His competitors on the water laughed when he showed up in his outfit. "They stopped laughing when I started bringing in eight bushels of quahogs," he said. "I have never dug quahogs as thick as this. I've never made as much money."
MacLeod is out digging most days from early morning until the afternoon. If the water is iced over, he breaks it up with his canoe, named "The Quahaug King" (using the Indian spelling for the mollusk).
"I'm pretty insensitive to the cold," he said.
Sometimes a seal accompanies MacLeod in the water. Otherwise, he's the main attraction at the New Meadows Lake and Mill Pond.
"One guy said to me, `Hey look there's a walrus in the water,' " MacLeod said.

His wet suit enables him to stay in the water for hours. Most other harvesters rake for quahogs from boats. Quahogs, a salty and thick-shelled clam, are distinctive to New England.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
DownTown! is the newest restaurant to inhabit the basement of the old Biddeford Journal building, across from City Hall.
Diners should not be fooled by the unassuming surroundings. DownTown! is uptown when it comes to food, wine and personal attention from chef and owner Myke Leavitt.
The restaurant is divided into two areas. A bar and smokers' dining room is to the right of the entry hall. Beyond that is a large main dining room. Three walls are exposed brick, the ceiling is low, and there is no natural light. With all the bottles on display, the feeling is like being in a wine cellar - and of being in the most casual dining room you can imagine in spite of the white, gray and black linens on the table.
Leavitt's philosophy is that formal dining experiences are limiting, that only a certain number of people will suffer formality for food. He has chosen to offer a gourmet experience in an atmosphere that encourages people to come as they are, including flannel shirts and Bean boots. "Give them good food," he says, "and they will come."
And his food is fabulous.
Each day, a full sheet of specials is offered, including soups, appetizers, pasta, pork, game, fish, veal, chicken and shellfish. That's in addition to the extensive regular menu, which offers six appetizers ($4.95 to $6.95), three soups ($2.95 cup to $4.95 bowl), three salads ($1.95 to $3.95),seven entrees of seafood ($8.95 to $14.95, plus market price for specialties), six selections of chicken and veal ($12.95 to $14.95), eight choices of beef and wild game ($14.95 to $18.95) and four vegetarian offerings ($10.95 to $14.95), such as vegetable Napoleon ($14.95). He cooks to order, too.
Along with the full bar is an expansive wine list. Leavitt is also open to suggestions from patrons for wines and beers.
The evening we visited, we saw his expertise and enthusiasm first-hand. A party ofthree came in and confessed their lack of knowledge about red wines. After inquiring about their dinner selections, he went off to the bar and returned with three bottles. Uncorking them, he offered an impromptu wine tasting. After the three came to agreement on one vintage, Leavitt poured the wine and removed the other bottles.
Our waitress that evening was pleasant and friendly but not as knowledgeable as she should have been. In fairness, it was her first week, and she had not had the opportunity tosample the food.
With such a vast array of choices, we ordered a soup as a starter. I ordered sweet potato and leek ($2.95 cup/$3.95 bowl). It was sweet with a slight crunch and bite from the leeks. It had the additional subtle benefit of brandy, and it made for a delicious combination. My companion had the coastal Maine chowder ($2.95 cup/$4.95 bowl). It was packed with lobster, clams, scallops and fish all swimming in a light cream base.
We also tried the homemade bread, a delicate egg variety sprinkled with black and white sesame seeds.
Next, we ordered the lobster strudel appetizer ($4.95) to share. This luscious concoction of lobster and goat cheese was wrapped in a light phyllo dough and garnished with caramelized orange segments. It was served on a charger decorated with a red pepper sauce flourish in the shape of an elaborate L - in celebration of lobster. We devoured it.
Other appetizers include mushrooms ($6.95) stuffed and baked with seafood, macadamia nuts, Swiss cheese and fresh aromatic herbs; and a goat cheese platter ($5.95) accompanied by pear salsa.
We shared a pretty salad ($1.95 small/$3.95 large) of mixed greens, mushrooms, raddichio, red onion, grated carrot, calamata olives, cucumber and homemade blue cheese dressing. It was served on the side without requesting it that way. It was a blue cheese lover's delight, crammed with good-quality chunks of cheese in a light, creamy base. It was one the best dressings I've ever had. The dressings, all made from scratch, includechili caper (the house special) and a sour cream and herb.
For entrees, we each ordered chef's specials of the day. I selected the jumbo shrimp and scallops with fresh orange and ginger rice ($17.95). The 20-plus scallops and five huge shrimp were caramelized and then deglazed with brandy. They were served over a bed of fantastic fresh orange and ginger rice.
My companion chose the pork tenderloin with spiked apples ($16.95). The generous tenderloin was dipped in molasses and charbroiled, topped with a touch of Katahdin cheddar cheese. It was served over sauteed apples spiked with sweet spices and Calvados Boulard brandy. The dish was as dramatic as it sounds. The pork, molasses, cheddar, apple and brandy combination was outstanding.
Served with both dinners were roasted red bliss potatoes and tender, fluffy zucchini fritters accompanied by a zesty tomato reduction relish.
Other entrees included charbroiled bison steak ($19.95) served over a roasted red pepper-port wine demi-glaze and topped with a fresh sage gremolata; roulades of veal with a seafood stuffing ($16.95) served over a tomato-caper buerre blanc; and chicken and lobster veloute ($17.95) - a boneless breast of chicken, breaded and wrapped around a Maine lobster tail and served over a lobster veloute.
Groaning with delight, we bravely pushed on to dessert. I ordered the chocolate-orange sorbet ($3). It arrived served in a hollowed-out orange shell, sitting on a plate decorated with rich chocolate sauce. It was beautiful, refreshing and tasty.
My companion had Stars & Scotia Blues ($4.75). The premium Nova Scotia blueberries were tossed with Grand Marnier liqueur and garnished with slices of succulent star fruit. It was served in a lacy pastry shell.
Also offered was Landry's apple pie ($3), named for DownTown!'s excellent Sous Chef. Several parfaits are available, including Vandermint, Bailey's Irish Cream and Sambuca (all $4.75).
Our bill - excluding drinks, tax and tip - was $66.29.
Outstanding food, great wine, causal atmosphere - everyone's going to wish DownTown! was right around the corner in their town.

STATE, WEST BATH SEEK WASTEWATER SOLUTION TO REOPEN CLAM FLATS

Abstract: Brighams Cove, closed to clam digging for 15 years, could reopen if a solution can be found to residential sewage systems that send treated wastewater into the New Meadows River. More than 350 acres of mud flats on Brighams Cove have remained closed because the homes - all equipped with overboard discharge systems - spew treated wastewater into the river. Under state and federal regulations, the presence of the discharge pipes requires the flats to be closed even if the wastewater is not polluting flats. A properly functioning system treats wastewater with chlorine and other chemicals before it enters the river. The issue goes beyond West Bath's borders. Phippsburg's 36 commercially licensed diggers, who must cope with periodic clam-flat closures on the Kennebec River side of their town, are clamoring for Brighams Cove flats to reopen. The boundary between the towns splits Brighams Cove in half. There are 23 commercial diggers in West Bath.

Full text: Brighams Cove, closed to clam digging for 15 years, could reopen if a solution can be found to residential sewage systems that send treated wastewater into the New Meadows River.
State and local officials met Monday at West Bath Town Hall to discuss how to prevent seven homes on the West Bath side of the cove from discharging treated wastewater from toilets and sinks.
Officials will explore several plans, which could be financed by a $100,000 state grant given to West Bath. The money is to be used to address problems caused by such discharge systems, which were banned in the state in 1987.
More than 350 acres of mud flats on Brighams Cove have remained closed because the homes - all equipped with overboard discharge systems - spew treated wastewater into the river. Under state and federal regulations, the presence of the discharge pipes requires the flats to be closed even if the wastewater is not polluting flats. A properly functioning system treats wastewater with chlorine and other chemicals before it enters the river.
In the past, the state Department of Environmental Protection issued licenses for overboard discharge systems. But with the adoption of more stringent federal guidelines, the practice waseliminated and by 1987 no new licenses were being issued. Currently, the state renews licenses for about 2,000 overboard discharge systems allowed before 1987.
In 1989, the Legislature created the Overboard Discharge System grant program to help homeowners with the cost of removing them. West Bath is eligible to receive a $100,000 grant. The DEP has begun to target such areas as Brighams Cove where clams could be harvested.
The issue goes beyond West Bath's borders. Phippsburg's 36 commercially licensed diggers, who must cope with periodic clam-flat closures on the Kennebec River side of their town, are clamoring for Brighams Cove flats to reopen. The boundary between the towns splits Brighams Cove in half. There are 23 commercial diggers in West Bath.
"We'd like to see those flats reopened," said Joel Knee, chairman of West Bath's Shellfish Committee. "But West Bath's hands are totally tied. There's nothing we can do. The people who need to have pressure put on them (are) the Department of Environmental Protection."
The DEP says it is prepared to start spending funds from the $100,000 grant to help homeowners on Brighams Cove replace or repair their existing overboard discharge systems. But, in the DEP's view, the project is an all-or-nothing proposition.
"If you only fix say three out of the seven (overboard discharge systems), then you've accomplished nothing in that cove," said David Achorn, a senior engineer who administers the DEP's Overboard Discharge Loan program.
West Bath selectmen decided that a meeting with the state's soil scientist, David P. Rocque, might lead to a solution which would satisfy clam diggers, the DEP and property owners.
"I think this (meeting) is more or less the last resort. If we can't save the cove then that's it. It goes on the back burner," said Ronald Beal, chairman of the selectmen.
In the final analysis, Rocque said all but one of the seven overboard discharge systems could be replaced with a system that will not pollute clam flats. The system owned by Dr. John VanOrden poses a problem because of its location.
VanOrden's year-round home is on a rocky ledge that juts out into the cove, said William Maier, a Bath consultant hired to study the problem.
"I don't know how we could get to it," Maier said. "It's a ledge ridge."
Another solution would be a cluster septic system. It would serve all of the Brighams Cove homes that have overboard discharge systems. Land would have to be acquired. Selectmen said they would have to present such a proposal to town meeting for approval.
"You'd be asking the town to approve funding for seven homes to dump there," Selectman Ralph Merry said. "It won't happen."
If the town and state cannot come up with a solution, then Brighams Cove will have to remain closed to clam digging.

Full text: You might call it a victory for the environment, or a testament to better land use. Carol Putnam, a novice clam digger, just calls it "great."
Saturday marked the opening of the first full clamming season in 10 years at the flats here. The state allowed only nine days of clamming last spring.
In some places, opening clam flats that were previously closed because of pollution means a boon to people who supplement their incomes by digging clams.
But in Ogunquit, where clamming has always been for recreation only, the opening of the flats reestablishes one of those distinctly Maine traditions.
"There's no economic impact here to speak of," said Dana Putnam, Carol's husband. "You do it because you love it."
Putnam's black rubber boots with the yellow line are ankle deep in mud on the low-tide banks of the Ogunquit River. Wearing two flannel shirts, he digs with his bare hands and a clamming fork - like a four-tonged garden rake with a shorter handle and 9-inch tongs.
Putnam drops the clams into a wooden slatted basket.
The temperature here is a bit below 40 degrees. With the 20 mph winds, the wind chill is well below freezing. The roar of the choppy ocean is unmistakable over the far side of a tall sand dune.
Mounds of dark mud left behind by clammers pock the flats and stand in contrast to seas of golden sea grass that will be submerged in a few hours' time. When the water next recedes, the flats will be smooth again.
"It's like going out and picking a tomato and eating it in the garden. It's good food," said Isabel Lewando, the woman most responsible for the
reopening of the flats. "It's like picking blueberries or shooting a moose."
It was Lewando who helped step up the pace of water-quality testing by the Department of Marine Resources and got the agency to approve clam-digging during winter, when there is the least amount of pollution in the water.
After new federal rules went into effect in 1988, the state closed many flats because the fecal bacteria counts were too high. Since then, the Department of Marine Resources has been opening more flats each year. From a high of about 33 percent in 1988, now only about one quarter of the flats are still closed. Each year the department opens about 10,000 acres of flats and adjacent waters to clamming.
Fecal contamination in estuaries like this come from many sources, including human sewage treatment plants and septic systems, wild animals and pets. When there's too much fecal matter on land, it usually makes its way into the water.
Paul Anderson, director of the public health division of the Department of Marine Resources, says the biggest reason for more clam flats opening is that sewage treatment plants are getting better, as are septic systems.
He gives the Clean Water Act of the 1970s a lot of credit for that.
While residents haven't had a chance to dig for clams in a decade, one group has: professional diggers for Spinney Creek Shellfish in Eliot. They were allowed to dig from January to March this year. When flats are closed because of pollution, DMR can give companies with special purification plants, like Spinney, permission to dig slightly contaminated clams, purify them and sell them.
That doesn't sit well with residents who have been waiting to get a crack at the clams. Several remarked Saturday that the biggest clams seemed to be gone.
Now that the flats are open, though, the town gets to set some of the rules. One of those rules is that clammers can dig only one peck of clams per day, only on weekends and holidays, and they can't sell what they collect. Spinney is out.
Because it's been so long since the flats were open, many of the 100 people to get licenses this year were newcomers who rarely - if ever - have dug clams before.
The last time Elsie Johnson went clamming was 50 years ago in New Bedford, Mass.
"Here we are in our 70s and we decided to get a license to go clamming," said Johnson, decked out in green rubber boots, a reddish-orange knit winter hat and black rubber gloves cinched at the wrists with rubber bands. Her husband, George, carries a garden rake for digging.
"It'sjust the fun of being out, and eating them," Elsie said. The two left after an hour or so, content with the barely dozen clams they picked up.
"People's attitudes are great," said Arthur Damren, the town's clam warden. "They're very very happy we're doing this again this year."
Wearing hip waders so he can cross the river - even at low tide it's waist deep - Damren will be crisscrossing the flats from the bridge by Beach Street to the footbridge about three-quarters of a mile north, talking toclammers, making sure they know the rules. He gave the Johnsons a cross-section of a 2-inch PVC pipe so they could measure their catch and make sure the clams were large enough.
But he hasn't seen any problems so far, and doesn't expect any.
"They're just happy they can come down here and clam," he said. "People's attitudes are great." Arthur Damren, Ogunquit clam warden

KATAHDIN KEEPS PACKING 'EM IN - WITH GOOD REASON

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]09 Nov 1997: 2.E.

Abstract: Stepping inside Katahdin, you find a plethora of kitsch, art and ephemera to keep diners amused for hours. The large, long bar occupies the far wall of the dining room. Tables are dotted around the room, against walls, windows and any available space. Some have comfortable wing and easy-type chairs pulled up to them. The majority of tables tops are hand-painted. No two are alike. Ditto for the salt and pepper shakers at each table. They're all vintage collectibles. Many are gifts from loyal customers. Murals are painted on the walls of the dining room, over the bar and even in the bathrooms. All this color and movement sets the tone for the fast pace the Katahdin enjoys on most nights. Dinners run the gamut from pasta to pork, pot roast to grilled seafood, priced from $10.95 to $14.95.

Many restaurants are like old friends. Even though you haven't visited with them in a while, as soon as you sit down together, you remember what you like about them so much.
That's just how I felt during a recent visit to Katahdin.
Established in 1991, this restaurant holds court at High and Spring streets in Portland. It's a fine and funky place that has won the following of Mainers and tourists alike because it serves interesting food at affordable prices. And the wonderful atmosphere adds to the happy experience.
Stepping inside Katahdin, you find a plethora of kitsch, art and ephemera to keep diners amused for hours. The large, long bar occupies the far wall of the dining room. Tables are dotted around the room, against walls, windows and any available space. Some have comfortable wing and easy-type chairs pulled up to them. The majority of tables tops are hand-painted. No two are alike.
Ditto for the salt and pepper shakers at each table. They're all vintage collectibles. Many are gifts from loyal customers. Murals are painted on the walls of the dining room, over the bar and even in the bathrooms. All this color and movement sets the tone for the fast pace the Katahdin enjoys on most nights.
From the 20-somethings at the bar sipping martinis and Katahdin's famous margaritas to the 70-somethings imbibing in the same drinks at their tables, the clientele is a cross-section of Maine.
We arrived at 5 p.m. on a Saturday night. By 6 p.m., there was barely standing room, as people lined up at the bar and at thedoor, all waiting for a table.
Gretchen Bates, the owner, has put her personal stamp on the place, not only with the decor but with the menu. The emphasis is on fresh food grown or raised locally whenever possible. The result is a menu that is both eclectic and satisfying.
The set menu offers three soups daily - fish chowder ($2.95 cup/$3.95 bowl), oyster stew ($3.95 cup/$6.95 bowl) and a soup of the day ($1.95 cup/$2.95 bowl). Five appetizers are offered as well as two daily specials ($5.50 to $6.95). The five salads range from modest garden ($2.50) to Caesar topped with London broil ($8.50).
Dinners run the gamut from pasta to pork, pot roast to grilled seafood, priced from $10.95 to $14.95. A daily chef's choice blue plate special ($10.95), served with a cup of soup and a garden salad, is always offered. Vegetarian entrees are also available, such as the enchilada filled with black beans, corn, spinach and cheddar cheese ($11.95).
After a deliciously icy martini, I began with a cup of thebutternut squash soup with honey and clove ($1.95). The flavor was subtle and included carrot and cream. The texture was light and delicious. It was garnished with chives, a beautiful color contrast to the pale orange soup.
My companion ordered the chef's special smoked seafood plate ($6.95), a combination of salmon, trout, mussels and shrimp. This generous plate was served with a red onion marmalade and a remoulade sauce that had a nice bite. All the seafood was tasty, though our personal favorites were the trout and mussels. Their flavor was outstanding.
The chef's special mesclun salad ($5.50) with apples, walnuts, blue cheese and a sherry vinaigrette sounded appealing. The presentation was as pleasing to the eye as the flavor combo was to the palate, and the amount of dressing was just right.
My companion had the garden salad that is served with most meals. Fresh greens were combined with cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage and julienne carrots. Unfortunately, it was overpowered by an intense creamypesto dressing that had been copiously applied. Along with the salads, we had Katahdin's trademark warm buttermilk biscuits.
For an entree, I chose crab cakes ($14.95). Advertised as Katahdin's secret nontraditional recipe, it was served with grilled tomatoes and tarter sauce. "Nontraditional" is an apt description, as the over-sized cakes are fish-mousse based, rolled in cornmeal and lightly fried. Though crammed with crab, the dominant flavors were egg and cornmeal. I prefer a crabbier tasting cake.
Served alongside was a tasty rice with carrot, black pepper, lemon and tumeric and Katahdin's quirky non-fat mashed root vegetable dish of turnip, beets, butternut squash and orange. I like the combination, especially the spicy bite, but because I was dining with a confirmed turnip-beet-squash hater, it made me wonder how many other people would prefer another choice of vegetable.
My companion had the braised lamb shank ($11.95) with curried chick peas and rice. The shank was huge and fork-tender,the curry mild and the right touch with the meat. Rice, mashed root vegetables and a medley of zucchini, cauliflower and carrots were also served.
Other special entrees that evening were grilled mahi mahi ($13.95) in a Thai marinade with a roasted red pepper pistachio pesto; stuffed sweet potato ($10.95) with curried cous cous and lentils and a honey cucumber yogurt sauce; and the blue plate special, pan-seared bluefish ($10.95) with mustard herb crust.
Desserts are a real treat at Katahdin. I had the peach raspberry cobbler ($4.25) served warm with real whipped cream. It was sensational.
My companion could not pass up the chocolate mountain ($4.50), the dessert for which the restaurant has become famous. Chocolate mousse is enrobed in chocolate cake, which is encased in a chocolate shell. Then the "mountain" is covered with chocolate sauce and topped with homemade whipped cream. It truly is to die for.
Other dessert choices include chocolate pudding cake ($3.75), pecan bourbon pie ($4.25) and homemade ice cream and fat-free sorbet ($3.50).
Our bill, without drinks and before tax and tip, was $55.
As we wedged our way out the front door, we were immensely satisfied and happy. We can't wait for a reunion.

THE GOOD TABLE: CAPE'S ROADSIDE DINING TREAT

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]02 Nov 1997: 2.E.

Abstract: Entrees, including sandwiches and salads, range from $3.50 to $14.95. Sandwiches served during dinner include Haddockwich with fries and slaw ($5.60), and gyros, a Greek classic of tender strips of beef and lamb ($4.95). Other beef, chicken, fish and Greek entrees come with salads and vegetable side dishes. For an entree, I chose one of the evening's specials, sesame salmon with carrot, leek, ginger butter sauce and cold sesame noodles ($12.95). The salmon was a generous portion covered with a subtly fragrant sauce of leeks, ginger and carrot. The sesame noodles were a surprising and interesting accompaniment. Flavored with peanut butter and sesame seeds and served cold, they played off the sweet and spicy sauce of the salmon. My companion chose another special, linguine with grilled chicken, parmesan cream sauce and butternut squash ($10.95). The cream sauce was outrageous - thick and rich with butter, cheese and cream. The chicken breast was moist and served in slices over the pasta. The butternut squash came unadorned as a side dish after it was requested it be served that way. The squash is usually served with the chicken on top of the dish.

After ingesting every crumb of my appetizer, I whispered to my dining partner, "Do you think I could get away with licking my plate?"
It was a great way to begin our meal at The Good Table, the warm and comfortable restaurant on Route 77 in Cape Elizabeth, just across from the road that leads to Two Lights State Park.
Established in 1986 by daughter and father Lisa and Tony Kostopoulos, The Good Table is a roadside dining treat that lives up to its slogan "honest food, honest prices."
The Good Table is housed in a small, cape-inspired building complete with window boxes, lobster traps, a wood-burning stove and an enclosed porch for use most of the year.
The night we visited, there were bountiful displays of seasonal produce at the entrance. With a nip in the air, it was the right touch to put us in mood for steaming mugs of mulled cider infused with rum ($3.95), the featured seasonal cocktail of theevening.
Lisa Kostopoulos is the executive chef and official greeter. Her expansive personality makes her the perfect host. She's also an exacting chef. I saw her return to a table where an appetizer had just been served and remove it. She explained to the diners that she could smell a change in the oil used to fry it. She returned with a fresh order.
The restaurant seats 100 people in three areas, including the porch. The walls are decorated with old photos and amusing collections of items such as women's hats from the 1950s. Large windows throw soft light on summer evenings and flood the place during Sunday brunch. Furnishings are plain, floors are bare hardwood, and specials are listed on a blackboard each day.
Though there is no bar area, a selection of house wine is available - hymettos, pendelli, retsina, roditiys, white Zinfandel - at $3.25 a glass, $12 a bottle. There are a limited number of other selections at $15 and $16 a bottle.
Three soups are offered each day, including Tony Kostopoulos' famous fish chowder ($2.25 cup/$3.95 bowl) and several soups of the day ($1.75 cup/$2.75 bowl). Appetizers are listed on the specials board and change daily (95 cents to $5.95).
Entrees, including sandwiches and salads, range from $3.50 to $14.95. Sandwiches served during dinner include Haddockwich with fries and slaw ($5.60), and gyros, a Greek classic of tender strips of beef and lamb ($4.95). Other beef, chicken, fish and Greek entrees come with salads and vegetable side dishes.
Vegetarians are also represented with spanakopita - spinach and feta nestled in fillo ($8.95), several large salads including Greek ($4.95) and such specials as squash stuffed with leeks, vegetables, rice and cheddar ($10.95).
The appetizer that made me want to lick my plate was pan-blackened Cajun oysters ($5.95). These tender delicacies were fried to light perfection and served with a spicy roumalade sauce. They melted in my mouth. The spice on both the oysters and in the roumalade was noticeable but not overpowering. This was truly a delicious dish.
My companion was smiling over a cup of the creamy mushroom soup ($1.75). It was made from a turkey stock and was redolent with cream, butter and mushrooms. It was the best either of us had ever eaten.
The other soup that evening was a spicy Jamaican pepperpot made with root vegetables. Other appetizers were focaccia with sun-dried tomatoes and boursin cheese ($3.95), and a hummus platter with toasted pita bread and cut vegetables ($3.95).
Our house salads were a nice mix of lettuce, tomatoes, green peppers, red onion, summer squash, cucumbers and grated carrot. I tried the creamy garlic dressing. It could have been a bit more garlic-intense for my taste, but it was pleasant. My companion had the Greek vinaigrette. Once again, it was mild but flavorful. Our complaint was that there was too much of it. The salads were saturated. We would have been satisfied with a third of the amount served.
For an entree, I chose one of the evening's specials, sesame salmon with carrot, leek, ginger butter sauce and cold sesame noodles ($12.95). The salmon was a generous portion covered with a subtly fragrant sauce of leeks, ginger and carrot. The sesame noodles were a surprising and interesting accompaniment. Flavored with peanut butter and sesame seeds and served cold, they played off the sweet and spicy sauce of the salmon.
My companion chose another special, linguine with grilled chicken, parmesan cream sauce and butternut squash ($10.95). The cream sauce was outrageous - thick and rich with butter, cheese and cream. The chicken breast was moist and served in slices over the pasta. The butternut squash came unadorned as a side dish after it was requested it be served that way. The squash is usually served with the chicken on top of the dish.
Other special offerings that evening were pan-blackened mahi mahi with black bean salsa ($12.95) and twin lobsters with French fries and slaw ($14.95). Off the regular menu, Lisa suggested their best-seller, Cambridge steak tips ($9.95). They are flame-grilled with Lisa's best barbecue sauce. The favorite Greek specialty is Psari Plaki ($9.95) fresh haddock, or Psari scallops ($10.95), baked in a tomato, sweet bell pepper, onion, olive oil and herb sauce.
Eating dessert wasn't a hardship. Every cake, pie and tart is homemade and mouthwatering. Making a choice was difficult.
I selected the chocolate amaretto cake ($2.75). The cake was tender and dark and iced with a light and creamy fudge frosting. It was topped with cherries and almonds, a great compliment to the amaretto flavor. It's available every day, along with cheese and carrot cake.
My companion had the warm apple pie with cinnamon ice cream ($4). It had a delicious crust and crumb topping. The cinnamon ice cream melted in rivulets, making it the perfect fall confection.
Our bill, before tip or tax, was $42.10.
By the time we ended our meal, the restaurant was full and would-be diners were waiting at the door. We were sure they wouldn't be disappointed.

LOUISIANA CAJUN CUISINE OVERSHADOWS FRANCO RECIPES

Abstract: Why is it that the Louisiana Cajun cooking has such a widespread following but the traditional Franco-American foods can barely be found in Maine? Both cuisines have the same French roots. Many Cajun recipes have French names peculiar to the Louisiana dialect. Nevertheless, Cajun cuisine seems to sell while many Franco-American foods are simply a part of ethnic nostalgia. For example, the staple base element of the Cajun cuisine is something called, "roux." Now, in my opinion, roux is nothing more than "fabrine brun" (brown flour). Roux is the staple for many Cajun recipes, especially gumbo. Delicious Cajun recipes like "chicken gumbo file" and "chicken gumbo with sausage and oysters."

Why is it that the Louisiana Cajun cooking has such a widespread following but the traditional Franco-American foods can barely be found in Maine? Both cuisines have the same French roots.
Many Cajun recipes have French names peculiar to the Louisiana dialect. Nevertheless, Cajun cuisine seems to sell while many Franco-American foods are simply a part of ethnic nostalgia.
For example, the staple base element of the Cajun cuisine is something called, "roux." Now, in my opinion, roux is nothing more than "fabrine brun" (brown flour). Roux is the staple for many Cajun recipes, especially gumbo. Delicious Cajun recipes like "chicken gumbo file" and "chicken gumbo with sausage and oysters."
In Franco-American recipes, "fabrine brun" is used to make ragout, a chicken dish familiar to nearly every Franco-American who grew up in a large family.
Both "roux" and "fabrine brun" are made by simply browning flour in a heavy skillet until the flour turns brown. However, a "roux" is made by adding oil or fat to the flour, while "fabrine brun" is generally mixed with just a little water.
Another similarity is "boudin," or sausage. Franco-Americans usually associate "boudin" with blood sausage. In the Creole kitchen, boudin can actually be a delicious light sausage that can be served as an hors d'oeuvre. Both the Franco-American and the Cajun boudin are made with the leftovers of the pig, but the Cajun variety usually calls for ingredients like jowls (pork cheeks) or pork belly with skin.
Cajuns also create something called, "chaudin," or "ponce with rice stuffing". This concoction is made with "ponce" or "pounce", which is actually the stomach of a pig. It is shaped like a kidney. Experts say when the ponce is cooked and stuffed with rice, it actually tastes something like bread! I am not sure if Franco-American cooks duplicate this recipe or not, but I have never heard of one who did.
Like most poor people who made their living from farms, there was very little that an imaginative cook could not create from the leftovers of a pig. Franco-Americans and Cajuns learned how to cook with pork backbones, pork fat, as well as nearly everything else.
What is interesting about Cajun cuisine is how many modern recipes continue to carry French names, like the families have taken pride in carrying on the traditions. Cajun cookbooks will list recipes like, "Poulet saute Parisian" (Parisian saute Chicken), and "filet de boeuf," like they are family staples.
Unfortunately, there are very few Franco-American recipes in most regional cookbooks. Most of the time, if a recipe is included in a cookbook, there is an excellent choice that it will be for "toutiere" (pork pie).
Cajuns make meat pies, but most of the recipes do not call for the wide variety of spices seen in Franco-American versions.
It is surely curious that the Cajuns in Louisiana have been able to build an entire culture around their language and cuisine, while the Franco-Americans are still struggling.

SLATES: IF THE QUIRKY DOESN'T GRAB YOU, THE GREAT FOOD WILL

Abstract: The notes from my visit read: "Visual Odyssey." Not the usual way I begin to describe a restaurant. But in the case of Slates in Hallowell, it's an apt description. Everything about this funky, fine bistro calls for attention - from the copious, eclectic art work to the inventive menu. The art, much of it vibrantly colored, lines the walls, perches on any available space and hangs from the ceiling. A concert series is offered in the restaurant every Monday, year round. We decided the restaurant serves as the unofficial cultural center of Hallowell. We were torn about choosing an entree with so many to consider. I selected one of the evening specials - spicy shrimp on a bed of Jasmine rice ($14.95). The five jumbo shrimp were served on the rice with oyster mushrooms and fried baby banana and topped with a jalapeno sauce. The presentation was dramatic - the whole affair was sitting on a banana leaf, the bananas golden and tender, the champagne colored mushrooms unfurled like ribbons, the shrimp beautifully pink. The flavors were outstanding, though I was surprised by the intensity of the jalapeno. The waitress had told me it was mild. It turned out to be fiery.

Full text: M. Eve Elzenga is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
The notes from my visit read: "Visual Odyssey." Not the usual way I begin to describe a restaurant. But in the case of Slates in Hallowell, it's an apt description. Everything about this funky, fine bistro calls for attention - from the copious, eclectic art work to the inventive menu.
Slates occupies an old storefront on Main Street, where it began 18 years ago under the current management. The restaurant is strung out in a series of rooms.
On the far end is the barroom. Straight out of another era, it has a low tin ceiling and an inviting, well worn mahogany bar that you can pull a stool up to. Booths line the exposed brick walls and there is a great table in the window.
The kitchen is behind this room and a display window between the two rooms allows you to mull over the dessert selections while you wait for a table.
The main dining room is narrow in depth but long. Opening off it are several smaller seating areas. All of them have exposed brick walls, all the better to showcase the art work - from the monthly rotating art show provided by local artists, to the permanent display of folk, primitive, arts, crafts, photographs, carvings, hooked rugs, stained glass and antiques.
The art, much of it vibrantly colored, lines the walls, perches on any available space and hangs from the ceiling. A concert series is offered in the restaurant every Monday, year round. We decided the restaurant serves as the unofficial cultural center of Hallowell.
The wait staff is as colorful as the decor, their outfits reflecting their personalities. A number of the staff have been with the restaurant since it opened. Our waitress was knowledgeable, efficient and very offbeat. Actually the whole place is - in a delightful way.
At 8:45 on a rainy weeknight in Hallowell, the place was packed. For a moment I thought I must surely be in Greenwich Village. The menu requires close attention - it's handwritten every day. That means the food changes daily, based on what's available and appealing at market.
Appetizers are advertised for one and two people. The eight choices the night we visited ranged in price from $5.95 to 8.95. Soup is $1.95 cup, $2.50 a bowl. Salads are a la carte and are available in dinner-size at $2.25-$2.95 and as entrees, $4.95-$6.50.
I counted 25 entrees that were listed, but more combinations are available. Prices range from $8.95-$16.95. There is also a child's plate at $5.95.
Since it was damp and chilly out, we skipped the appetizers and went for the soup. I tried a cup of the 1,000 vegetable ($1.95). It was a puree of carrots, potatoes, squash, and peas in a vegetable stock base flavored with curry. The consistency was thick and smooth and the flavor was taste-bud-bursting good.
My companion had a cup of the potato leek ($1.95). It was velvety and rich with lots of pepper and a lovely leek aroma.
Some of the appetizers we passed up included crostini with smoked shrimp, red onion and brie ($5.95), phyllo brie with habenero mango chutney and fresh fruit ($6.95) and a smoked seafood sampler ($7.95).
Along with the soup we tried the bread. It's all homemade, like all the baked goods, at Slate's bakery right up the street. The evening's selection was sage, scallion, cheddar. The crust was nicely browned with scallions on the top and the inside was tender and delicious.
A salad ($2.95) we shared was outstanding. A mix of fresh native greens and home-grown yellow tomatoes, it was dotted with tender pieces of fresh mozzarella. The balsamic vinegar and good quality olive oil that was served in cruets was just the right accompaniment.
We were torn about choosing an entree with so many to consider. I selected one of the evening specials - spicy shrimp on a bed of Jasmine rice ($14.95). The five jumbo shrimp were served on the rice with oyster mushrooms and fried baby banana and topped with a jalapeno sauce. The presentation was dramatic - the whole affair was sitting on a banana leaf, the bananas golden and tender, the champagne colored mushrooms unfurled like ribbons, the shrimp beautifully pink. The flavors were outstanding, though I was surprised by the intensity of the jalapeno. The waitress had told me it was mild. It turned out to be fiery.
My companion chose the grilled pork tenderloin ($14.95) with porcini mushrooms in a cognac sauce. The three large tenderloin slices had a wonderful crisp edge and a melt-in-your-mouth texture. The sauce was a subtle enhancement. It was served with yellow and green string beans and two perfect tiny baked potatoes.
Other offerings that night included shrimp and crabmeat with a coconut Thai sauce and sweet red peppers over rice ($13.50), vegetable parmesan on homemade pasta ($9.95) and beef tenderloin prepared as Diane ($14.25), Au Poivre ($14.50) or Boursin with mushroom ($14.95).
Since we never forget a good looking dessert, we couldn't wait to order what we had been perusing while we waited for a table. I selected the blackmagic cake with whipped cream and raspberries ($3.75). It was better than it looked! This was a real old-fashioned homemade deep chocolate cake with fudge icing.
My companion chose the bourbon toll house pie ($2.95, $4.25 for a la mode). With a dollop of real whipped cream it was sensational. Other desserts included homemade ice cream ($2.25 small dish, $4.75 for a sundae with homemade hot fudge or butterscotch), gingersnap or chocolate chip cookies ($1.00), cheesecakes ($3.50) and custard with raspberries ($2.75).
Slates is one of those rare treasures. They do what they do well, with their own quirky style. I can't wait to go again.

Abstract: Phippsburg's clam diggers say the dredging project will destroy clam flats by smothering baby clams and polluting flats. The project tookon a sense of urgency in August after the Sullivans DDG 68, a Navy destroyer built at BIW, scraped bottom near Doubling Point in Arrowsic. The vessel was on its way from the Bath shipyard to BIW's dry dock facility in Portland. Conflicts with local clam diggers arose when the Army Corps announced that 30,000 cubic yards of sand would be disposed of near Bluff Head, a spot close to Drummore Bay. Drummore is a clam flat Phippsburg hopes the state will reopen next year.

Full text: The federal government is planning to make the Kennebec River deeper to ensure the safe passage of Navy destroyers moving in and out of Bath Iron Works.
Phippsburg's clam diggers say the dredging project will destroy clam flats by smothering baby clams and polluting flats.
The project tookon a sense of urgency in August after the Sullivans DDG 68, a Navy destroyer built at BIW, scraped bottom near Doubling Point in Arrowsic. The vessel was on its way from the Bath shipyard to BIW's dry dock facility in Portland.
Destroyers travel up and down the river at least once a month en route to sea trials, to BIW's Portland facility, or to their home ports. The Kennebec River is their only access to the ocean from Bath.
Engineer Bill Kavanaugh, who is managing the dredging project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said the Sullivans sustained minor hull damage when it scraped the river's bottom.
The Army Corps plans to dredge the Kennebec River at Doubling Point and near Popham Beach, the river's mouth.
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection must approve the project before work can start. Kavanaugh said bids will be opened Oct. 27 with the work expected to start before Nov. 24, the date of the next scheduled trip of a Navy destroyer from the Portland dry dock to Bath. It should take three to four weeks to complete the job. The cost of the project won't be known until bids are opened.
Conflicts with local clam diggers arose when the Army Corps announced that 30,000 cubic yards of sand would be disposed of near Bluff Head, a spot close to Drummore Bay. Drummore is a clam flat Phippsburg hopes the state will reopen next year.
"They (the federal government) don't care about the little guy. All they care about is Bath Iron Works," said John D. Libby, a Phippsburg clam digger who works year-round.
Libby predicted tides will recirculate the sand dumped at Bluff Head onto the Drummore Bay flat and other Phippsburg flats along the river.
Diggers believe that dredged sand, which consists of some silt, will smother baby clams. They also worry that dredging will drive up fecal coliform levels, polluting clam flats.
Phippsburg's clam flats have a history of closing during heavy rainfalls, which cause Bath's sewage treatment facilities to overflow. Phippsburg is downriver from Bath.
"Our concern is, what if something happens? Who's going to help us?" Libby said. "We're going to squeak now because if we don't protect ourselves nobody else will."
Libby and other diggers have asked the Army Corps to dump all the dredged sand at Jackknife Ledge, an offshore dump site. Kavanaugh said moving sand dredged from Doubling Point 12 miles to the ocean would double project costs.
"The Army Corps is bound to find the least costly and most environmentally sensitive approach to a project like this and that (the clammers' request) does not accomplish that," Kavanaugh said.
In its proposal, the Army Corps said, "There is concern that Navy destroyers cannot transit the channel safely even during high tide. Future transits by these vessels could be delayed or hindered."
Phippsburg's Shellfish Committee, which has the support of the town selectmen, will monitor the condition of its clam flats by taking photographs and videos.
Brigit Cavanagh, a town selectman, said some Popham Beach property owners want the Army Corps to dispose of sand dredged from the river's mouth onto the beach, which they feel was eroded by a 1989 river dredging project. The Army Corps said that, too, would be too costly.
The Army Corps is planning to dispose of the sand dredged from Popham Beach at Jackknife Ledge. Studies have shown that currents redeposit sand dumped at the ledge onto the beach.
"You can rest assured Phippsburg will be keeping a close watch on the situation," Cavanagh said.

Abstract: Some antacids are billed as calcium supplements. It is unfortunate that consumers and health care providers alike have notbeen informed of their disadvantages. An antacid may contain calcium carbonate, but this is not a complete "osteoporosis preventative" formula. It lacks other essential nutrients for calcium absorption and bone mineralization. An adequate supplement will contain vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, boron - and calcium. Many antacids contain aluminum or magnesium hydroxides and can accelerate calcium loss from the body. I also do not recommend bone meal, dolomite clay and oyster shell calcium. These may benatural forms, but their calcium is not well absorbed, and they could contain hazardous amounts of toxic contaminants - arsenic, mercury, cadmium and lead. I tell my clients, "Just because it's natural, doesn't mean it's healthy."

Full text: Joan E. Herzog isa registered dietitian, nutrition consultant and owner of Nutrition Solutions Inc. You can write to her at 265 Stevens Ave., Portland, Maine 04103.
Here are more answers to your questions:
In an earlier column you stated you never recommend an antacid as a calcium supplement. What do you specifically recommend?
Some antacids are billed as calcium supplements. It is unfortunate that consumers and health care providers alike have notbeen informed of their disadvantages. An antacid may contain calcium carbonate, but this is not a complete "osteoporosis preventative" formula. It lacks other essential nutrients for calcium absorption and bone mineralization.
An adequate supplement will contain vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, boron - and calcium. Many antacids contain aluminum or magnesium hydroxides and can accelerate calcium loss from the body.
I also do not recommend bone meal, dolomite clay and oyster shell calcium. These may benatural forms, but their calcium is not well absorbed, and they could contain hazardous amounts of toxic contaminants - arsenic, mercury, cadmium and lead. I tell my clients, "Just because it's natural, doesn't mean it's healthy."
It is a very good idea to have your calcium intake assessed by a qualified dietitian and plan supplementation accordingly. Some experts advocate strongly for dairy foods as the preferred calcium source. Dairy calcium is well absorbed, but I cannot help concluding that some dietitians have fallen prey to the "GOT MILK?" propaganda.
The Dairy Council has long supported the American Dietetic Association with donations, free seminars and glossy patient education materials. Its brochure, titled Banking on Beautiful Bones, shows a too-thin model and states "Go for at least `3-a-day' dairy " as the first recommendation listed. With the vast majority of the world's population unable to drink cow's milk due to milk protein allergy, lactose intolerance and plain dislike, there are other ways to get calcium.
My daughters and I drink calcium-fortified soy milk and calcium-fortified orange juice. The juice contains as much calcium as cow's milk in a well-absorbed form, calcium citrate. We also eat tofu, salmon and dark green leafy vegetables. We take a supplement that meets my requirements. The CVS store brand called Calcium plus minerals with D is complete and also inexpensive, $1.99 for 60 600 mg. tablets when it is on sale.
I never know what I need in the vitamin store. Different clerks tell me different things. How do I get proper advice?
I believe you are looking in the wrong place if you want proper supplementation advice. I once asked a vitamin chain store clerk what would help my arthritis. The recommendations ranged from ludicrous (shark cartilage), potentially poisonous (oyster shells) to deadly (ephedra). The seven supplements he recommended ran more than $170.
The problem is the lack of jurisdiction the Food and Drug Administration has over the natural foodindustry. Manufacturers can produce and say about anything as long as their product is labeled as food.
Be smart and seek out the advice of a qualified dietitian. To find one, ask these questions: Where did you get your degree? Did you complete an American Dietetic Association hospital internship? Are you hospital trained in the area of my specific disease? Do you have advanced training in my disease?

REGENCY'S ARMORY OFFERS HOTEL DINING AT ITS MOST ELEGANT

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]28 Sep 1997: 2.E.

Abstract: We next turnedour attention to the dinner menu. Three soups were offered ($2.95 for soup du jour to $6.50 for lobster stew) along with nine appetizers ($4.95 to $7.95). Thirteen entrees are listed on the fixed menu ($14.95 to $23.95) as well as a separate lobster specials menu with five choices ($17.95 to $21.95). Several daily appetizer and entree specials are also offered. For an entree, I chose the lobster en croute ($19.95). It was a generous portion of sweet lobster meat sauteed with oyster mushrooms, leeks and herbs with puff pastry in a sherry cream sauce. The pastry was airy - tender, not tough - and had a delicate flavor. It lined the bottom of the plate as well as dramatically topping the dish. The oyster mushrooms were plentiful, their pale beige color playing off the reds and pinks of the lobster. The entire affair was resting in a pool of rich sherry cream sauce. The plate was garnished with citrus slices, decorative kale, small pink flowers and ultra-thin julienned yellow and red pepper curls. The presentation was a work of art. This dish was a joy to eat. My companion chose the chicken breast ($15.95) sauteed with artichoke hearts, watercress, leeks, garlic, lemon, white wine and rosemary. The presentation alone was worth the order. Two enormous sauteed breasts were separated on the plate by a serving of dark green rappi. The spicy flavor of this cooked green was made more pungent by the addition of vinegar. Arranged around the perimeter were six large artichoke hearts. The entree was resting on a bed of sauteed leeks and watercress in a delicious wine sauce. It also had the same garnish as my meal.

Forget everything you ever thought about hotel restaurant food. The Armory Restaurant, in the Regency Hotel in the heart of Portland's Old Port, proves otherwise.
The restaurant, on the lower level of the hotel, is an elegant and quiet retreat. Decorated in deep burgundies and greens, with rich texture on walls, upholstery and carpet, crowned with beautiful carved wood moldings, it is reminiscent of big-city supper clubs of the 1950s and early '60s. And the food is equal to the surroundings.
The midweek night we dined, we were the only people in the place. Surrounded by music that featured romantic ballads and show tunes, we settled into luxurious chairs and perused the menus.
The waitress left a wine list, and we were impressed by the good selection of red, white, champagne and sparking vintages. They ranged from $16 for Penfolds Koonunga - an Australian Chardonnay - to $139 for Dom Perignon Champagne. Wine was also available by the glass for $5 to $8.
We next turnedour attention to the dinner menu. Three soups were offered ($2.95 for soup du jour to $6.50 for lobster stew) along with nine appetizers ($4.95 to $7.95). Thirteen entrees are listed on the fixed menu ($14.95 to $23.95) as well as a separate lobster specials menu with five choices ($17.95 to $21.95). Several daily appetizer and entree specials are also offered.
After we made our selections, the waitress brought a warm, fragrant baguette presented in a dramatic wire basket lined with parchment. We tried not to eat too much while we waited for our appetizers.
My artichoke hearts ($5.95) had been lightly breaded and pan-fried with a garlic, basil and feta cheese sauce. While the artichokes were canned, not fresh, the preparation made them delicious.
My companion had the grilled jumbo shrimp ($6.95) served with a spicy hoisin barbecue sauce. The shrimp were huge, brushed with some sauce and grilled to caramelized perfection.
Other appetizers included a smoked seafood plate for two ($7.95) featuring native smoked salmon, trout, shrimp, scallops and Cajun catfish with a horseradish mustard sauce; mushroom tart ($4.95), a combination of mushroom duxelle topped with sliced mushrooms in a puff pastry crust; crab cakes ($6.50) and baked Brie ($6.50) with fresh fruit and crackers.
House salad was served next, a colorful mix of greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, julienned carrots and sprouts. The only dressing available was the house balsamic vinaigrette. This version was thick and too copiously applied, but it had a great flavor.
For an entree, I chose the lobster en croute ($19.95). It was a generous portion of sweet lobster meat sauteed with oyster mushrooms, leeks and herbs with puff pastry in a sherry cream sauce. The pastry was airy - tender, not tough - and had a delicate flavor. It lined the bottom of the plate as well as dramatically topping the dish. The oyster mushrooms were plentiful, their pale beige color playing off the reds and pinks of the lobster. The entire affair was resting in a pool of rich sherry cream sauce. The plate was garnished with citrus slices, decorative kale, small pink flowers and ultra-thin julienned yellow and red pepper curls. The presentation was a work of art. This dish was a joy to eat.
My companion chose the chicken breast ($15.95) sauteed with artichoke hearts, watercress, leeks, garlic, lemon, white wine and rosemary. The presentation alone was worth the order. Two enormous sauteed breasts were separated on the plate by a serving of dark green rappi. The spicy flavor of this cooked green was made more pungent by the addition of vinegar. Arranged around the perimeter were six large artichoke hearts. The entree was resting on a bed of sauteed leeks and watercress in a delicious wine sauce. It also had the same garnish as my meal.
Accompanying the entrees were side orders of a vegetable medley - zucchini, summer squash, carrots, onion and herbs. A bit too much oil had been used in the sauteeing, but they were cooked to perfection - not too crunchy or soft. My companion had the rice pilaf, very simple and a good match for the chicken dish. I chose the au gratin potatoes. These thin slices of potato had a great cheesy taste but were too oily.
Other entrees included tricolored cheese ravioli with grilled vegetables and fresh mozzarella ($14.95); roast veal tenderloin ($20.95) with portabella mushrooms, Marsala wine and a horseradish mustard mousseline sauce; and haddock fillets ($16.95) sauteed with Maine shrimp, wine, lemon and Parmesan cheese.
Forcing ourselves to choose dessert, I selected the iced lemon souffle ($4.50) with fresh strawberries and blueberries. A six-inch tall column of white chocolate lace wrapped around the frozen souffle and was topped with a slice of candied lemon. Sitting in a pool of lemon cream, the berries surrounding it, it was dramatic and delicious.
My companion had the bittersweet chocolate pate ($4.50) with fresh fruit and cinnamon hazelnut cookies. This generous, dense rectangular block of bittersweet confection had been rolled in powdered cocoa and topped with whole hazelnuts. Strawberries and orange slices were served along with the cookies. It was a death-by-chocolate experience.
The biggest surprise of the evening came when the check was presented. The Armory was offering a special - any two appetizers, entrees and desserts for $49. Without the special offer, the bill would have totaled $57.80, still a good deal.
As we sipped our coffee and tea and listened to Johnny Mathis croon an old tune, we knew this was one hotel dining room we'd be returning to soon.

But Kennedy grew up in Falmouth and has dedicated himself to the cause of cleaning up and reopening the hometown flats. Town officials voted Monday to issue recreational clamming permits for 150 residents and 15 non-residents. Falmouth's opening, scheduled for Nov. 1, is the latest in a series of clam-flat openings up and down the Maine coast.

Full text:   Lyman Kennedy soon plans to go clamming in his own town for the first time in over a decade, now that Falmouth is about to be added to the list of Maine towns with reopened clam flats.
Kennedy, 45, is a lobsterman who bought his first boat with the money he made from clamming. For years, he has been forced to take up his hobby elsewhere, most recently with his license in Cumberland.
But Kennedy grew up in Falmouth and has dedicated himself to the cause of cleaning up and reopening the hometown flats. Town officials voted Monday to issue recreational clamming permits for 150 residents and 15 non-residents.
"Some people go golfing. I go clamming," said Kennedy, chairman of the town's Shellfish Conservation Committee. "I just like to go down and walk the beach."
Falmouth's opening, scheduled for Nov. 1, is the latest in a series of clam-flat openings up and down the Maine coast. It has taken years, but volunteers and workers in understaffed state agencies have worked together to reclaim the flats - cleaning those that have been polluted and testing those that might be.
Flats in Brunswick, Kennebunk, Jonesboro, Wiscasset, St. George and the Portland islands are among flats opened this year or possibly scheduled to open within the next few months.
"We're riding a wave and going pretty well as far as cleaning up," said Paul Anderson, director of the state's shellfish sanitation program.
mx
In Falmouth, licenses can be used for digging on property southwest of the Casco Bay Terrace dock and northeast of Portland Country Club,including The Brothers Islands but excluding Mussel Cove.
Formal state approval is expected soon and licenses can be picked up Oct. 14.
Recreational licenses will allow clammers to take a peck - about 8 quarts - of clams each day from Nov. 1 through April 30.
"It's a neat option for locals for taking shellfish and harvesting their own dinner," Anderson said.
Ogunquit temporarily opened its flats for a few lucky locals and fewer non-residents in April, but closed for the summer months, when summertime pollution tends to contaminate the clams.
Tentatively, those flats will reopen in November.
Anthony Ciampa, 69, went clamming for the first time during the brief Ogunquit season. His daughters bought him a clamming fork for the occasion. After his first day, Ciampa realized he would need some boots, too.
"That was a great experience," he said, noting he collected enough clams over those few weekends to share with 10 families.
Since 1991, Freeport each year has opened about 200to 300 acres of its 13,000 acres of clam flats for commercial and recreational digging. In those six years, the percentage of open clam flats has increased from 30 percent to 99 percent, according to Mick McGivaren, Freeport shellfish program coordinator.
The change has been in sharp contrast to the flat-closing trend, which only recently is turning around.
In some areas, sewage or other pollutants were - and in some cases still are - flowing into the flats at a rate fast enough to contaminate clams. Because clams suck in whatever happens to come across their siphons, they may end up taking in bacteria or viruses harmful to humans.
If any given flat has too much pollutant over an 18-month average, the state closes it.
Many of the state's most-polluted flats, such as those in the Fore River in Portland, closed in the 1940s.
More flats closed in the late 1980s due to pollution from increased coastal development and tougher Food and Drug Administration regulations.
During that time, the state Department of Marine Resources found it did not have enough information about many flats to know their level of pollution, or enough staff to find out. At the same time, the state cut funding and the agency didn't have enough money for testing.
Instead of keeping questionable areas open, the state closed nearly 20 percent of Maine's clam flats until more data could be collected.
In recent years, organizations such as Friends of Casco Bay and local volunteers have banded together to sample water and find the sources of pollution.
Enough information-collecting and cleanup has been done in places such as Falmouth to determine the clams are safe to eat.
In Falmouth, for example, officials found some of the pollution was coming from boats' discharge of waste. To keep the sewage out of the water, the town installed pumps at the Handy Boat Marina and off the town's harbormaster boat. Boaters who have town moorings can pump their boat tanks at no cost.
In the past few years, with similar efforts, the state has been able to open at least 13 percent of the state's flats. CLAM FACTS
Clams use their "foot muscle" to dig quickly into the sand. According to experienced clammers, clams burrow into the sand so quickly it can often be hard to rake them.
Clams used as steamers also are known as soft-shell clams.
The bigger, white palm-sized shells sometimes found along the beach are hard-shell or chowder clams. These clams are tougher than soft-shell clams and can be chopped up for chowder.
As experienced clammers know, the bigger the clam, the deeper it will bury itself in the mud. Clams deep below the mud stretch their siphon, or neck, to the surface of the mud to feed and breathe. A clam 8 inches down into the mud can stretch its neck to the surface.
The age of a clam can be determined by the number of rings on its shell. Clams grow two new rings each year. "Some people go golfing. I go clamming. ... I just like to go down and walk the beach." Lyman Kennedy, chairman Shellfish Conservation Committee in Falmouth

THE JULIE N SPILL: LESSONS LEARNED MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE HARBOR SINCE THE JULIE N DISASTER

Abstract: Steve Eufemia walks through a patch of marsh along the Fore River and remembers the way it looked during the adrenalin-packed days after the tanker Julie N hit the Portland Bridge a year ago: It was black. Then Eufemia, who responded to the spill for the state Department of Environmental Protection, points to a bare spot in the marsh that probably shouldn't be bare. He peels back some matted grass, looks down on a rainbow sheen in the black mud and recognizes the faint, familiar odor of oil. Within a few hours of the accident, as a rainbow sheen spread up and down the river, the ship was at South Portland's Rolling Mills terminal, circled with booms. Locally based response crews were sucking up the spewing oil. The ship would spill a total of about 180,000 gallons of light heating oil and heavy bunker oil that fueled the ship.

Full text: Steve Eufemia walks through a patch of marsh along the Fore River and remembers the way it looked during the adrenalin-packed days after the tanker Julie N hit the Portland Bridge a year ago: It was black.
"This place got pasted," Eufemia says.
Nearly a year later, it's green again. The marsh, just east of Stroudwater, where Congress Street crosses the Fore River, looks pretty much normal at first glance.
Then Eufemia, who responded to the spill for the state Department of Environmental Protection, points to a bare spot in the marsh that probably shouldn't be bare. He peels back some matted grass, looks down on a rainbow sheen in the black mud and recognizes the faint, familiar odor of oil.
"A quick brush through and I'd say, `Wow. There's no oil spill here.' " But, in truth, the spill hasn't gone away.
To most of us, Portland Harbor looks much as it did before it was coated in oil on Sept. 27, 1996.
The year since the accident has been one of continual change, however.And the legacy of the Julie N is far from complete.
While migratory birds fly away clean, the Fore River is still scarred. Nature's long recovery there continues.
Lobstermen and boat owners have mostly settled their damage claims from the spill, but long-term settlements - including money for the state to do an environmental restoration project - haven't even been put on the table.
New emergency planning and safety standards have been put in place. And several important reports on the harbor and the Julie N cleanup are expected to make more recommendations later this year.
The Julie N, meanwhile, is patched up and plying the waters of the Far East.
And the Portland Bridge, the harbor's most notorious hazard for decades, is being ripped down.
It was a year ago Saturday when James Mooney, a Scarborough man and an experienced Portland Harbor pilot, tried to point the Julie N through the 81-year-old drawbridge.
As he lined up the bow of the 85-foot-wide ship to squeeze through the 95-foot-wide channel of the bridge, Mooney ordered "hard port" when he meant to say "hard starboard." Before he could correct himself, the Julie N's port bow slammed into the bridge pier.
A submerged corner of the granite peeled back a gaping hole in the hull.
"Oil in the water!" is what Mooney recalled hearing as the ship bounced off the bridge.
Mooney later described it as the most traumatic moment of his life. He still routinely pilots tankers, but continues to keep a low public profile and did not return messages asking him to comment for this article.
Mooney immediately told investigators his misspoken command caused the accident, and the investigation seemed straightforward.
Within days, reporters for the Maine Sunday Telegram and Portland Press Herald discovered that Mooney had never been tested for alcohol after the accident, as required by federal law.
Coast Guard Cmdr. Burton Russell, ordered by superiors to investigate the lack of a test, said a series of honest mistakes led a laboratory to conduct a routine test - the kind required to be done randomly on pilots - for illegal drugs only.
Russell maintained that alcohol was not a factor in the accident. There has been no evidence to the contrary. The final report on the cause is due later this year.
Within a few hours of the accident, as a rainbow sheen spread up and down the river, the ship was at South Portland's Rolling Mills terminal, circled with booms. Locally based response crews were sucking up the spewing oil. The ship would spill a total of about 180,000 gallons of light heating oil and heavy bunker oil that fueled the ship.
The location of the ship in the confined inner harbor and the clear weather, along with years of planning, drilling and accumulating equipment, provided an effective edge for the response effort. Oil slicks were kept from spreading out into the bay.
The efforts failed to keep the strong tide from carrying oil into the upper Fore River and the Stroudwater Marsh, however. Criticism rang out from frustrated residents.
In the end, calculations showed that 78 percent of the spilled oil was recaptured - an astonishingly high amount. Although that means 39,600 gallons of oil either evaporated or was left behind, the recovery rate was well above the industry benchmark, which says successful cleanups recapture 10 to 15 percent of the oil lost in spills.
The successful response gave an early boost to the environmental recovery.
Timing also helped. Because the spill happened when fish and birds had migrated out of the estuary, the wildlife impact was not as severe as some had feared.
Twenty-seven oiled birds, mostly gulls and cormorants, died. Twelve were rehabilitated and released. Hundreds more were seen with oil on them, but were not brought to the rehabilitation center, said Richard Dressler, wildlife habitat group leader for Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
There was no fish kill and no die-off of shellfish, even though mussels and clams in the area still appear to be taking in oil from the mud.
Torrential rains last October washed away much of the visible oil from the salt marshes. The winter, though not as harsh as scientists had hoped, removed more of the contamination.
Most of the marsh grass survived, with only scattered patches of thin or dead grasses.
"Given the way it looked last year after the spill, obviously it's on its way back," said Dressler. "There's been a big jump in one year, but it's going to take more than one year. It's going to takeseveral years."
In terms of a toxic effect - any threat that the spilled oil might kill birds or wildlife - the danger has passed, experts say.
"But in terms of assessing all the long-term implications, we are still going to try to figure all that out," said Paul Van Cott, regional director of the Department of Environmental Protection.
Counting the dollars
The financial cost of the spill also isn't finalized. Within days of the accident, however, it was clear the price tag would be high.
The cleanup effort cost $46 million - $257 for every gallon spilled. The cleanup is considered pricey even though the oil was fairly well contained and even though some of the oil was purposefully left on the marsh, because scientists feared trying to clean it could worsen the damage there.
The cost is attributed to the sticky consistency of the ship's fuel oil - called bunker oil - which coated and seeped into the gravel and rocky shoreline between the Portland Bridge and Veterans Memorial Bridge.
Damage claims for property or business losses from the spill have so far added $7 million to the cost. Maritime Overseas Corp., the operator of the Julie N, compensated such claimants as lobstermen who could not fish, and the owners of boats and docks damaged by oil.
Not every claim was paid. Maine Marine Patrol officers helped to screen out some bogus claims, such as one from an urchin diver who said the spill kept him from harvesting near Fort Gorges, even though there are no urchins there.
Some waterfront businesses are still waiting for checks.
Joey Scola of Nancy's Seafoods was one of the lobster dealers who had to scramble to get thousands of lobsters out of holding tanks around the harbor.
Scola received $8,000 for crates of lobsters that got contaminated. But he said he's still trying to get a fair price for the loss of revenue during the time the harbor was closed to lobstering and boat traffic.
"I shut down for three weeks," Scola said. "I lost customers that I still haven't got back."
Most claims were settled quickly, and many say they were happy with their settlements. Those familiar with oil spills say they have been impressed that Maritime Overseas settled most of the claims without lawsuits, and that they have been constructively involved in the cleanup and environmental-damage assessment.
"I think we acquitted ourselves well, and I think everybody else did, too," said George Blake, vice president of the company. He said the company has used the Portland experience to assure other ports that it can be trusted.
The largest unknown cost is the settlement on environmental damages.
Under a new federal process set up last year, a group of state agencies and Maritime Overseas have been working together to assess the damages to public resources.
The National Resources Damage Assessment could be completed this fall. Unlike environmental claims in past spills, the state won't simply demand a payment and then fight for it. Instead, the state and Maritime Overseas will design an environmental restoration project - perhaps on a nearby salt marsh - and the company will finance the project.
The company's insurance underwriter will cover the cost up to a liability limit based on the vessel's size - in this case, $23 million. That is far below a price tag that could ultimately exceed $60 million for cleanup and damage claims.
Maritime Overseas will seek to cover the rest of the costs from the National Pollution Funds Center, a fund that is set up with oilindustry fees to pay for cleanups when there is no responsible party. Companies that take responsibility for a spill also can make claims on the fund if the spill did not involve wrongdoing or negligence.
The company will not try to recover damages from Mooney or from his employer, Portland Tugboat and Ship Docking Co., Blake said.
"We wouldn't do that," said Blake. "It was an honest mistake."
Series of changes follow
That costly mistake led to a series of changes in the harbor duringthe past year, changes designed to improve preparedness or safety.
The advances have been incremental because the system worked overall, harbor officials said.
"Nothing really came out of this for dramatic change," said David Sait of the Department of Environmental Protection. "I think people thought that organizations worked pretty much the way we had hoped they would."
Burton Russell, the commander of the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office and coordinator of the response, said the successful cleanup underscored the value of planning and preparation.
"The list of successes I think far outweighs the list of things that we can do better," said Russell, whose complete report on the response is due this fall.
One change, however, was Russell's creation of a new spill-management team after the Julie N spill. The team is made up of about 30 waterfront experts, from the baykeeper to terminal operators, who would coordinate the cleanup of a future spill during the first 18 to 24 hours -before a national team of experts arrives.
Russell's office also is better equipped now.
"We found that very quickly we ran out of cell phones; we ran out of VHF radios," he said. "It was shortfall, and what we have done with what limited discretionary budget we've had in the last year was to upgrade that."
Coast Guard officials have also been adding more detailed planning for spills around sensitive estuaries like the Fore River. It will speed up efforts to protect them if a spill happens nearby, Russell said.
Additional preparation also may include storage sheds along the river, stocked with heavy booms that are most effective in strong currents. Some also support placing permanent moorings around the river so that booms could more quickly be strung across the channel.
"We've learned that there's got to be a better way to protect the upper Fore River," said John Ferland, general manager of Clean Casco Bay, a first-response cleanup contractor based in the harbor. "To protect that area, it's got to take more boom."
Ferland said despite the overall success of the spill response, cleanup contractors around the harbor have brought in new equipment based on their experiences during the spill response.
While preparedness is improving, so is safety.
That's mostly due to the fact that the new Casco Bay Bridge is open and the Portland Bridge is being torn down. The shipping channel through the harbor will go from 95 feet wide to 135 feet wide next month and to 197 feet wide by the end of the year.
There are some new regulatory safety measures as well, many of which came out of one of the biggest oversights following the crash: failure to test Mooney for alcohol.
The Portland Harbor Commission now requires random drug and alcohol testing of bay pilots and harbor pilots.
The Coast Guard had already required random drug tests and post-accident tests for drugs and alcohol, and is continuing to make sure marine employers understand and comply with the rules, Russell said.
Coast Guard accident investigators also now are trained and equipped to conduct breath tests for alcohol at the scenes of accidents. It will ensure that the tests are done quickly enough to be useful during an investigation, he said. Alcohol gradually dissipates in the body, so prompt testing is important.
The agency's failure to make sure such testing was done quickly after the Julie N became a focus of the two-day National Transportation Safety Board hearing in South Portland last March.
The NTSB report is due in November or December, and is expected to include nationwide recommendations on alcohol testing.
One of the biggest benefits drawn from the Portland Harbor's worst oil spill is that it provided real-life experience, something that emergency crews hope they never really get, but appreciate when they do.
If another accident happens, and the adrenalin rush hits as it did a year ago, the people who fight to limit damage in the harbor say they'll be much better prepared and a little less confused.
"It was actually kind of exciting at the time," recalls Eufemia, one of the state employees who responded to the spill for the Department of Environmental Protection. "But it's not something I'd wish on us, for sure."
AFTER THE SPILL
Here is a look at some major events and changes in Portland Harbor, following last year's oil spill.
Sept. 27, 1996 - The tanker Julie N hits the Portland Bridge, spilling 180,000 gallons of heating oil and bunker fuel oil and closing the bridge.
Sept. 29, 1996 - An oil slick spreads up the Fore River, blackening the Stroudwater Marsh.
Sept. 30, 1996 - Portland Bridge reopens to car traffic.
Oct. 10, 1997 - Portland Harbor Commission suspends Capt. James Mooney's pilot license for 60 days.
Oct. 11, 1996 - Following newspaper and other reports, U.S. Coast Guard officials acknowledge that no alcohol test was done on Mooney, as required by federal law. Despite the oversight, alcohol is not considered a factor.
Oct. 19, 1997 - The Julie N leaves the harbor for repairs, bumping the Portland Bridge on the way out.
Nov. 26, 1996 - Mooney has his licensed restored and returns to work.
Dec. 12, 1996 - Portland Harbor Commission votes to require random drug and alcohol testing of pilots.
March 13, 1997 - The National Transportation Safety Board begins a two-day hearing in South Portland.
March 26, 1997 - The Coast Guard stages a mock spill to train a new volunteer spill management team.
July 15, 1997 - Crews return to the harbor to remove hardened oil and sand from the Portland waterfront, the final act of the oil spill cleanup.
Aug. 30. 1997 - The new Casco Bay Bridge opens, allowing crews to begin dismantling the old Portland Bridge. "Given the way it looked last year after the spill, obviously it's on its way back." Richard Dressler, Inland Fisheries and Wildlife

Full text:   Harder lobster shells, better pearls and new improved medicines for osteoporosis and kidney stones are seen as possible fruits of a research partnership between Maine and Utahcompanies announced Wednesday.
The partnership involves AquaBio Product Services, a marine research center based in Bar Harbor, and NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Salt Lake City, a research and development firm specializing in calcium control in humans.
Under the deal, AquaBio gets the right to new information that benefits aquaculture, and NPS gets anything that helps its medical research to benefit humans, said Ira Levine, AquaBio's chief operating officer.
Gov. Angus King, who attended the announcement of the partnership, said it represents "exactly the kind of new industry that we want to attract to Maine" and "puts Maine at the forefront of marine biotechnology innovation."
Under the agreement, the Maine firm gets to use NPS' proprietary technology and materials such as molecules in studies of calcium physiology of fish, shellfish and other marine organisms.
In return, NPS gets a 6 percent share of the Maine firm, with an opportunity to acquire a larger share.
In addition, NPS gets a access to new knowledge about the regulation of calcium that may be applicable to humans.
Calcium is of key importance in many aspects of the life cycles of many aquatic species, including the adaptation of fish to fresh and salt water, shell formation and egg development.
David L. Clark of NPS said the partnership will bolster AquaBio's ability to research areas like production of caviar in a way that would spare the egg-producing fish from being killed so they could produce more eggs.
Researchers are looking at how to raise fish like flounder in more kinds of underwater conditions, said Levine.
APS is also interested in ways to improve the production of pearls and to make shells of lobsters and crabs harder to enhance their value.
APS was founded by H. William Harris, Edward Brown and Steve Hebert, Harvard Medical School-affiliated researchers who discovered that specialized proteins that "sense" calcium in humans are also present in many aquatic species.

Full text:   One of the fastest growing marine research hubs in the country has won $625,000 in federal grants to build a dorm and a state-of-the-art cold-water lab.
Scientists from around the world come to the Darling Marine Center in summer to do research lasting weeks and months. The center also hosts undergraduates seeking research experience.
Soon, with $200,000 from the National Science Foundation and a $760,000 loan, the marine laboratory for the University of Maine will be able to house 80 students year-round.
The center's proposal for a new dormitory was top ranked among 120 universities with marine labs competing for the funding.
"We have had four awards from the National Science Foundation in a row. I wasn't expecting another home run," Director Kevin Eckelbarger said.
Additionally, an award of $1.2 million to the University of Maine at Orono's aquaculture program, from a different National Science Foundation program, includes $425,000 for the marine center's lab.
The need for the cold-water lab arose after the recent collapse of the fisheries, when scientists realized they didn't know much about the life cycles of commercial fish. "The program's chief purpose is to determine how to artificially culture finfish species," Eckelbarger said.
The 4,600-square-foot lab will contain a series of tanks with flowing chilled seawater, primarily for raising haddock and cod.
To grow the fish larvae, which live hundreds of feet beneath the surface, some of the tanks will have no light and temperatures as low as 45 degrees. By contrast, the Damariscotta River, which flows past the center, can reach 68 degrees Fahrenheit or more in the summertime.
As the fish get larger, they will be moved to increasingly brighter and warmer tanks, to accommodate various developing stages and breeding adult fish. Salinity levels will also be controlled.
The lab, to open in the fall of 1998, will additionally be used for raising other marine life requiring stringent environmental controls, including shellfish and algae.
The center already has a flowing seawater lab. The new lab, using chilled water, will be unique in this country, according to Eckelbarger. Two exist in Canada, and several overseas.
The dormitory, 8,000 square feet and costing $1 million, will house 80 students in 20 rooms, with a dining hall and kitchen.
To bolster the $200,000 federal grant, $760,000 in private trust money will be borrowed from the University of Maine, to be paid back over 10 years.
The building should be open by 2000, in time for the start of a new course at UMO's School of Marine Science, called Semester by the Sea.
Founded in 1966, the Darling Marine Center occupies 150 acres on an estuary south of Damariscotta. It has 23 buildings, including seasonal housing for 60, labs, a library, kitchen, administrative offices, and seven vessels used for research.
The center has seen explosive growth recently.
In the last five years, 350 scientists from 198 universities, 32 states, and 19 foreign countries have used the facility, an increase of almost 530 percent.
"It's out of control," Eckelbarger said.
Six buildings have been added since he took over in 1991. The summer internship has grown from five students in 1992 to 40 this year.
The director is already seeking funds for an addition to the yet-to-be constructed lab.
"It's gone way beyond where I dreamed it would be," said Eckelbarger. "I don't know when it's going to end."

Full text:   Opportunity rings most every day aboard Warren and Jon Radtke's 25-foot powerboat. Someone will need a taxi to an island. And, inevitably, someone will need a tow back to port.
The Radtkes' boat floats by John Dennison's 42-foot wooden lobster boat every afternoon and through the weekend, when he gets busy shucking oysters and clams to order.
With its increased popularity among pleasure boaters, entrepreneurs see Casco Bay as fertile water for floating businesses. And two of them - Sea Tow and Casco Bay Raw Bar - got a welcome boost from an exceptional boating season this year.
"I think Portland's got this tremendous potential," Jon Radtke said. "There's a lot of exciting things that still can happen."
The creation of these and other saltwater enterprises mark a milestone for Casco Bay.
There wasn't always a market like there is now. Portland Harbor drew far fewer boats into southern Casco Bay 15 years ago. The cleanup of coastal waters gradually changed that. New marinas opened during the 1980s, and the number of pleasure boats went from an estimated 500 in 1983 to 2,500 today.
"Of course, it all dates back to the time when we started cleaning up the water," said John Flynn, the acting harbor master.
The chain reaction that started with cleaner water fueled lots of new businesses, from tour boats to kayak dealers, to serve people who want to get out on the water. And now there are new businesses to serve all those people while they're out there.
Portland joined popular boating ports around the country in May, when Warren Radtke and his son Jon opened Portland Sea Tow. The closest Sea Tow operator had been Newburyport, Mass. Now there is a second Maine Sea Tow boat based in Walpole.
The business is based on a simple idea: "If something breaks, we'll come out and get you in," said Jon Radtke.
Sea Tow is a national network that works like AAA road service. Membership costs $95 a year, and you get free tows and service anywhere around the country. A tow for non-members is a minimum of $125. Sea Tow workers also carry fuel and a battery charger.
Last Wednesday morning, the boat's cellular phone rang with a typical call from the Coast Guard. The agency will transfer non-emergency breakdowns to Sea Tow or put out a general request for help over the marine radio, which the men monitor.
A 27-foot powerboat from Newburyport, Mass., had a broken water line and overheatedoff Goose Rocks in Biddeford. The owner was a Sea Tow member. It took about six hours to go get the boat and tow it to Portland for repairs.
The Radtkes haven't always made a living off the water. Jon is a 31-year-old history teacher at Gorham High School. Warren is a 62-year-old retired executive and Episcopal minister.
The pair decided last year that bringing Sea Tow to Casco Bay might make a good father-son venture. The men earned licenses to tow vessels and got a new boat with twin 90-horsepower Honda outboards. They painted the boat and a smaller backup boat with bright yellow paint and Sea Tow's logo.
Word soon spread, and they now have 40 members. They got several calls for tows last week. "What we're seeing now is deferred maintenance," said Jon Radtke.
The pair also offers taxi service. It was supposed to be a sideline - two taxis already operate here - but the men have been busy taking passengers to and from islands daily.
"It's a great service," said John Orestis, who became a member this summer.
Orestis uses his powerboat to travel between the harbor and his summer home on Little Diamond Island. He called twice for a tow when he had steering problems on the bay, he said, and he used the taxi service once when the fog got thick.
The Radtkes take shifts answering the phone 24 hours a day, and they rarely have used a relief captain. "I've been out at 2 in the morning delivering gasoline to people," Jon said.
It's been a busier summer than they expected. The business has made a profit.
Except for handing over the helm, however, they haven't spent much time together. "The way its worked out, you end up saying, `Tag, you're it,' " said Jon.
They plan to take the boats out in November, then come back in the spring with more help. "The long-term potential looks good," Jon said.
Food for thought
John Dennison saw another unmet need on the bay - a mobile raw bar.
Dennison was on his boat last year opening oysters for friends when the lightbulb blinked on. "Some old mariner walks by with his tote bag and says, `Hey, what are you doing there?' " Dennison said.
He got a mobile food service license and went to work. "Being mobile was a really key aspect that nobody else offered," he said. "It's so simple, it's just beautiful."
An urchin diver during the winters and a part-time radio disc jockey, Dennison learned to shuck and serve shellfish when he ran a raw bar in Vermont for three years.
Dennison gets oysters from Damariscotta and littleneck clams from Rhode Island and Massachusetts. He makes his own oyster sauces, including a champagne mignonette. He flash-boils shrimp in bay leaf and malobar peppercorn.
On nice afternoons and weekends, Dennison sets flowers around his 42-year-old lobster boat, the Jackie Jerry, turns on some reggae and flies a string of flags that spell oyster.
Usually, he's serving customers at his berth in Sunset Marina on the South Portland side of the harbor. But he also travels to Peaks Island and delivers special orders for parties. "If you have a dock, I'm there," he said.
He's even taken customers on a cruise.
Dennison hasn't yet turned the idea into a profit. The costs are low, but so is the profit margin, he said. He sells oysters for about $1 a piece depending on costs. In a good weekend, he'll sell 10 to 15 dozen oysters.
Next year, Dennison said, he may offer lobster bakes. He's determined that the business will grow. "It's too cool an idea" to give it up, he said. "Everybody loves it."
Sometimes, he'll pull up to a dock, and a line of excited customers forms. "I feel like the ice cream truck of Casco Bay," he said.
Now there's an idea.

Full text:   Twenty restaurants will join together today to celebrate "Extra Helping Day," a promotion to benefit United Way-funded agencies in Mid-Coast Maine by donating a portion of each bill they collect. Participating restaurants are: the Broadway Deli, the Captain Daniel Stone Inn, Fat-Boy Drive-Inn, Scarlet Begonia and the Cafe at Bookland in Brunswick; J.R. Maxwell's, the Kennebec Tavern, Kristina's and the Starlight Cafe in Bath; the Log Cabin Restaurant on Bailey Island; the Osprey Restaurant in Georgetown; the Salt Bay Cafe in Damariscotta; Le Garage, Patty's Place, Sarah's Cafe and the Sea Basket Restaurant in Wiscasset; the Muddy Rudder in Edgecomb; and the Blue Moon Cafe, Fisherman's Wharf Inn and Voila Restaurant in Boothbay Harbor.
The University of Maine's School of Marine Sciences has received a $1.17 million grant from the National Science Foundation for research and development. The grant, which will cover the cost of a new 4,600 square-foot flowing seawater lab for culturing fish and shellfish at the college's Darling Marine Center in Walpole, will also be used to pay for improvements to the aquaculture labs on the Orono campus. In addition, the grant will provide new research equipment, funding for student assistantships and partial support for four new faculty members in the School of Marine Sciences. The university is planning to use $888,000 in salaries and other various costs to match the grant, bringing the two-year project total to over $2 million.

REOPENING ISLAND CLAM FLATS REWARDS US FOR A CLEANER BAY MORE CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE TO MAKE CASCO BAY BETTER.

Abstract: Visitors and residents of three Casco Bay islands may soon have a treat: fresh claims dug from island flats long closed because of pollution. Working with the state, Friends of Casco Bay is now testing clams taken from beds on Great Diamond, Peaks and Cliff islands. While the water around these areas has become clean enough to support safe shellfish, industrial pollutants in the muck or sewage from local sources could still taint the clams.

Full text:   Visitors and residents of three Casco Bay islands may soon have a treat: fresh claims dug from island flats long closed because of pollution.
If the clam beds are reopened, it will be a tangible reward for time and money spent to clean up one of the more striking bodies of water in the world.
Working with the state, Friends of Casco Bay is now testing clams taken from beds on Great Diamond, Peaks and Cliff islands. While the water around these areas has become clean enough to support safe shellfish, industrial pollutants in the muck or sewage from local sources could still taint the clams.
The biggest contributor to the cleaner water in this part of the bay is the four-year-old wastewater treatment plant on Peaks Island. Before it came on line, raw sewage could be seen drifting in the waters around the island.
If the clams prove to be tainted, no one should be discouraged. That the bay has become clean enough to make testing worthwhile is itself a milestone.
Future milestones will depend on abating other sources of pollution, however. There are still homes that dump wastewater into the bay. Also, area sewer systems, including Portland's, flow over during heavy storms, dumping raw sewage into the bay.
That's why the $23 million plan to separate Portland's storm water drains and sewerage is so important. If this investment is made and homes that use the bay as a cesspool are targeted, Casco Bay can become cleaner. The rewards will be as sweet as a steamer.

PORTLAND'S ISLANDS MAY RECLAIM CLAMS IF THE FLATS ARE OPEN FOR DIGGING, THEY WOULD SERVE AS A TANGIBLE SIGN OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH CASCO BAY HAS BEEN CLEANED UP.

Abstract: "It was scuttled here in the 1950s. That may have been about the last time they dug clams around here, too," said [Joseph] Payne, as he headed to shore with clam rakes and buckets to revive the forgotten tradition. Theirs was a significant cause: If the clams they found there and at two other islands near Portland turn out to be as clean as the water is, some islanders could soon enjoy a coastal rite that has been illegal in their locales for decades. Payne, who is baykeeper for the nonprofit Friends of Casco Bay, led digging excursions to three Portland island shellfish beds in the last two weeks. It was part of a final push to blow holes in a shellfishing ban that stretches across the whole southern end of Casco Bay.

Full text:   Joseph Payne steered into Lamson Cove and looked toward the rotting timbers of an old steamship next to nearby Little Diamond Island.
"It was scuttled here in the 1950s. That may have been about the last time they dug clams around here, too," said Payne, as he headed to shore with clam rakes and buckets to revive the forgotten tradition.
Payne and a team of consultants and volunteers dug and sifted through the muddy cove for soft-shell clams last week.
Theirs was a significant cause: If the clams they found there and at two other islands near Portland turn out to be as clean as the water is, some islanders could soon enjoy a coastal rite that has been illegal in their locales for decades.
They can start digging their own steamers and chowder clams.
And, even more important to many, reopened clam flats so near Maine's largest urban center - indeed, within Portland city limits - would be a symbolic achievement in the effort to reverse coastal pollution.
Payne, who is baykeeper for the nonprofit Friends of Casco Bay, led digging excursions to three Portland island shellfish beds in the last two weeks. It was part of a final push to blow holes in a shellfishing ban that stretches across the whole southern end of Casco Bay.
"All of this has been closed for as long as anyone can remember," Payne said. "It's a part of our heritage that's been lost."
The state is considering opening some clam flats on Peaks and Cliff islands, and between Little Diamond and Great Diamond islands.
There aren't many islanders who remember getting clams from the flats, at least not legally. It's not even clear when the bans started here, but it probably was even before the end of the steamship era.
"I think Portland has been closed a long time, probably back into the 1930s," said John Hurst, marine resources scientist at the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The area was definitely closed when he started the job in 1951, Hurst said.
Shellfish tend to accumulate whatever pollutants are flowing into the water, including bacteria from sewage that can make people sick. And it was obvious in the 1950s that Maine's rivers and coastal waters contained untreated sewage. The waste was easy to see and smell, said Hurst.
The tide turned in the 1960s and 1970s. Landmark cleanup laws were passed. Communities built their first sewage treatment plants and began to focus on industrial discharges.
"It's unbelievable how much better things are," said Hurst.
Pockets still fouled
While increasingly isolated, there remain pockets of Maine's coastline still fouled with untreated sewage. Even at other parts of the same islands that may soon yield legal clams, some homes discharge sewage straight into the bay.
During rainstorms, municipal sewage treatment systems still overflow with diluted sewage into places like Portland's Back Cove. And the mouths of urban rivers are known to be contaminated with other health threats - heavy metals and solvents.
"As you can well imagine, there are a lot of places that are going to stay closed," said Paul Anderson, director of shellfish and sanitation for the Department of Marine Resources.
With larger stretches of coastline now cleaned up, however, the state has reopened about 10,000 acres of flats and waters to shellfish harvesting during each of the last three years, said Anderson.
"All that effort that went into the cleaning up during the past couple of decades, we're finally getting some benefits," he said.
Some ofthe reopened flats have been in Casco Bay, as close to Portland as Freeport, Yarmouth and Chebeague Island.
In Falmouth, clam flats near Mackworth Island were opened to a company that is licensed to harvest and purify marginally polluted shellfish. And in Falmouth, local and state officials are preparing to open up clam flats farther north to limited public digging.
Portland is new focus
Now the focus has turned to small areas around Portland's islands, such as Centennial Beach on Peaks Island, a northern shore of Cliff Island, and Lamson Cove between Great and Little Diamond islands.
Years of water sampling by Friends of Casco Bay show that bacteria levels - the primary obstacle to opening flats - have dropped to within acceptable levels for clam digging. The dramatic improvement in the quality of water around Peaks is directly due to the island's four-year-old sewage treatment plant.
"The old-timers on Peaks talk about how this is where human excrement was on the water," said Chuck Radis, a Peaks resident and physician in Portland. When the plant opened, the bacteria levels in the water dropped to near zero, he said.
On Tuesday, Radis and his two daughters helped dig for sample clams at Centennial Beach. The group of volunteers grew as other hopeful residents pitched in.
"God, it's been so long since I've dug clams, the next day I was so sore I couldn't stand up," said Jim Lash, a Peaks resident who used to dig around Boothbay. "I'd love to be able to get out there and dig a clam or two that I could keep."
The possibility for legal clamming has caught the attention of many islanders. And the reaction is mixed.
"We might gain far more than we want," said Shane Barden, a resident of Cliff Island who has helped to sample water for testing.
Flats could bring visitors
Reopened flats could bring visitors who want to dig for clams. On Cliff, the only public property is the roads, and none of the roads leads to the shellfish beds.
"We're not set up for tourism," she said. "I support their efforts. I'd love to know the clam flats are safe. I just feel islands are a little different from mainland shores."
It's a concern familiar to Larry Mead, a Portland city official who oversees services to the islands.
"They're certainly happy that the bay is getting cleaner," he said. "But they don't want to see a disruption to the way of life there."
The city already has a draft ordinance ready to control clamming in case the state does open the flats, Mead said. He said islanders will have a say in who digs where and when, decisions that ultimately will be made by the City Council.
Because the clam flats are so small and remote, he said, any digging is sure to be on a small scale and only for recreation.
"I think probably it's just going to be an informal, nice thing to do if you live out there," said Mead.
While the promising water tests have city officials and islanders already preparing for reopenings, three hurdles remain before the statecan declare the flats clean enough.
The biggest is the laboratory analysis on the samples dug up by Payne and the volunteers.
Extra testing being done
Because the flats are so near an urban center, Friends of Casco Bay raised money to do extra testing. A consultant, Normandeau Associates, will have the clams tested for industrial toxins such as heavy metals that could be in the flats.
"If there's stuff in it," said Payne, "then we'll answer that question, too."
State officials also must analyze the flow of water from the city's East End sewage treatment plant to make sure effluent isn't headed toward the flats when people might be digging.
And finally, state officials must estimate the impact of boaters who illegally dump their sewage tanks in Casco Bay. The estimate will be based on the number of boats in an area, and a conservative assumption of how many will pollute the water.
The result of that estimate could keep digging off limits during boating season.
A final decision could come in several months, said Anderson.
Payne and the volunteers are hopeful. The diggers weren't even discouraged last week when it turned out to be harder than expected to find clams in the mud.
They weren't hoping for a lot, they said. They just hope they're clean again.
"It's really a metaphor for the bay," said Radis.
"God, it's been so long since I've dug clams, the next day I was so sore I couldn't stand up. I'd love to be able to get out there and dig a clam or two that I could keep." Jim Lash, Peaks Island resident
"We're not set up for tourism. I support their efforts. I'd love to know the clam flats are safe. I just feel islands are a little different from mainland shores." Shane Barden, Cliff Island resident Sections of Portland's islands may be opened for clamming if tests show the clams are clean.

FOR BIRDS, NO FEAR OF FLYING ON STRATTON ISLAND

Of all the natural attributes that make Stratton Island so appealing to birds, the biggest attraction may be what it lacks - people.
"It's one of the jewels of the bay," said Pat Moynahan, a volunteer for the Maine Audubon Society who has been guiding bird lovers around the Audubon sanctuary for the past four years. "It juts out into the Atlantic flyway, and it's not disturbed. It's very accessible for the birds, and there's no people there to inhibit their activity."
Rocky Stratton Island, first populated in 1605, was donated to the National Audubon Society by the Chase family more than 25 years ago, along with two neighboring, smaller and even rockier islands.
Stratton's location and its freshwater pond make it an island that birds adore. It's a nesting colony and roosting site for a remarkable diversity of coastal birds, Moynahan said.
There is limited public access to the island, especially from May through mid-August, when researchers camp out there as part of the National Audubon Society Seabird Restoration Project.
While anyone with a boat or kayak can reach Stratton, which is less than 1 1/2 miles off Prouts Neck in Scarborough, naturalists and birders are advised to call the National Audubon Society office in Maine first to see whether a volunteer researcher will be available for a tour and to avoid interrupting the intensive study of birds on the island.
"The researchers spend long hours in the blinds," Moynahan said. "It's also a rocky shore, and there's no good mooring, so prior arrangement is indicated."
Stratton is a gold mine for bird-related research. The long list of research activities includes a census of wading birds, observation of the state's only pair of breeding American oyster catchers, and studying the habits of terns - everything from diet and breeding to the effects of weather on the chicks and dates of hatching and fledging. Researchers even use night visitor monitors to see what is preying on the tern nests.
Stratton is a known nesting area for great blue, little blue, green-backed and tricolored herons, snowy egrets and glossy ibis, and is the most reliable place in York County, Moynahan says, to spot the common moorhen.
"It is one of the most popular trips I lead, and for good reason," Moynahan said.
That said, it's not surprising that Wednesday's trip to Stratton Island, the third and last offered by Maine Audubon this summer, is full. Information about visiting the island is available through the Maine office of the National Audubon Society at 564-7946.
Visitors lucky enough to visit Stratton during research months may have a hard time deciding what to see. Some may be invited into the blinds where researchers work and for a close look at the three different terns that breed on the island - the endangered roseate tern, the Arctic tern and the common tern. The rare chance to see them all together helps birders differentiate between the species.
There is also plenty of bird activity around the pond, including ibis, wood and black ducks, common eiders and herring gulls. In the early evening, it's often possible to watch the herons flying in to roost, spectacular against the setting sun. And some visitors are just curious about the primitive camp where researchers hunker down for the summer with their books and instruments.

ARTISTRY FLOURISHING IN THE CULINARY GALLERY OF ARROWS

Fine art is created in many ways. Clark Frasier and Mark Gaier, the owners and chefs at Arrows, use their restaurant as their canvas. Not beautifulbut staid like sculpture or painting, Arrows is an evolving creation. No detail is too small to be unimportant. The artists' vision and control are evident from the moment you arrive.
To dine here is to experience high art. It is absolutely unforgettable.
The 1800 house that serves as the restaurant is surrounded by gardens - for cutting, cooking and sensual delight. The restaurant employs three full-time gardeners. Each morning, the master gardener compiles a list of produce, herbs and flowers available that day from the garden. Gaier and Frasier design the day's menu around that availability.
But the gardens are more than a source of raw material. They are the backdrop for diners seated in the window-lined rear dining room. In the sunlight, the garden decorates the room. In the moonlight, the garden becomes mysterious, dotted with small white lights hanging from trees.
As guests enter the long, narrow dining room, they are greeted by a dramatic flower arrangement that climbs to the ceiling. It's created daily and serves as the only decoration, the only blast of color in the interior of this simple room. The tables are set with classic service - crisp, stark-white linen, silver, and very thin crystal.
The wait staff are as impeccable as the table settings. Turned out in traditional black and white, their jackets bear the Arrows insignia in black. The night we dined, there were eight waiters along with two hosts, two bus people and six staff members in the kitchen. Frasier acts as host, stopping to chat with diners and inquire about their meals. The level of attention to diners' needs is reminiscent of another era.
All of this sets the stage for the real performance at the Arrows - the food.
Frasier developed expertise in Chinese cuisine while living in Beijing. He and Gaier met while working at Jeremiad Tower's Stars Restaurant in San Francisco. Their collaboration results in a mix of the best of America's new cuisine - a melding of American, European and Oriental influences. This year marks the 10th anniversary of Arrows.
In March, Frasier and Clark were recognized as "great regional chefs of the Northeast" by the James Beard House, a nonprofit culinary foundation in New York that showcases the best food in America.
When you sit down to dine at their table, it's apparent that each offering has been carefully thought out. And while each dish is capable of standing alone, taken together they create a completed work of art.
Each course is a la carte. A starter course- with oysters and-or caviar ($18) is always offered. Appetizers ($8.95 to $13.95) include soup and a Japanese-inspired bento box (a three-tiered picnic box that holds various starters) which changes daily. Salads ($8.25 to $9.50) are fresh from the garden. The main courses ($27.95 to $32.95) include red meat, fish and fowl offerings. The dessert menu includes a cheese course ($9.95), pastries ($7.50 to $7.95) and dessert wines and liquors ($6.50 to $21).
An impressive, extensive wine list is available, with prices ranging from $20 to $1,000 a bottle. Wine is also offered by the glass, and there is a full bar.
The night we visited, I began with a chilled yam vichyssoise with lobster-filled profiterole and sorrel cream ($10.95). The colors were beautiful together on the plate - the green sorrel cream floating in a pool of pale orange. The profiterole, a small cream-puff pastry shell, was filled with delicious lobster chunks.
My companion had the house-cured prosciutto with black mission figs, raspberry puree, sliced mango and mint ($12.95). The prosciutto was a tender pink color, soft and subtly flavored. The fig and mango were perfect accompaniments.
For a salad, I chose timbale of avocado, tomatoes and celery with Maine peekytoe crab (a small blue crab), yellow tomatoes, celery oil and balsamic vinegar ($9.50). The presentation was beautiful, the colors layered for maximum appeal and topped by the off-white crab.
My companion chose the butter lettuce salad with Danish blue cheese vinaigrette and spicy glazed pecans ($8.95). It was sensational. The lettuce melted in your mouth, and the cheese was outstanding. But the pecans made the salad. They were spiced with nutmeg and caramelized. Our waiter told us that they are so popular that they are now available for customers to take home.
Selecting a main course was difficult. The deep-fried Maryland jumbo softshell crabs with egg noodle pillow, warm greens, ginger juice and a carrot and scallion puree ($28.95) sounded wonderful. So did the roasted Guinea hen leg and smoked breast with a duck confit-potato pancake ($31.95) and the grilled bluefin tuna with Louisiana rock shrimp ($29.95).
I decided on the plank-roasted Maine salmon with a ragout of corn and summer vegetable burnoise, sun-dried tomatoes and rosemary hollandaise ($27.95). The salmon was an extraordinary color and texture - delicate, tender, refined. The salmon was served on the bed of vegetables, the light hollandaise finishing the dish perfectly.
My companion chose the grilled tenderloin of beef marinated with orange and star anise with rice noodle salad, garlic bok choy, vegetable wontons and a Chinese black bean sauce ($32.95). The beef was outstanding and the bokchoy zesty with garlic. The fried vegetable wontons were stuffed with grated beet and carrot and flavored with rice wine vinegar. A cold sesame rice noodle dish and marinated cold cucumber and bamboo slices completed this magnificent plate.
Forging on to dessert, I chose the strawberry shortcake with berry creme Chantilly ($7.95). It was the only disappointment of my meal. The biscuit, arrow-shaped and flavored with lemon, was dry. It was served with the creme Chantilly and dotted with halved strawberries. It lacked berry juice and flavor.
My companion ordered an exotic Mexican dessert - Pastel de tresleches with chocolate genoise, banana mousse, banana chips and cinnamon-flavored Italian meringue ($7.95). Served as a small, round, multilayered cake, it was beautiful, especially the elegant meringue, but it was rather bland.
Our meal, minus drinks and tip, totaled $130.
Because of the large wait staff, the dining room is a very busy place. Tables are fairly close together. It is noisy. Conversation, especially between two people, can be strained. But the food is fabulous - truly a work of art. Arrows is an experience not to missed.

ASK CANDICE HEYDON: SHIITAKE BUSINESS IS MUSHROOMING

Full text:   Do you like gourmet mushrooms?
Are you a patient sort of person who can stick to a fussy project for months at a time?
If you answer yes to both questions, and you have a few square yards of shady woodland on your property, you may want to invest in a half dozen freshly cut oak logs and a little $30 bag of mushroom spawn.
By inoculating the logs with spawn and watering them like a new lawn for weeks, youcould wind up harvesting baskets of delicious shiitake mushrooms so valued by cooks that they sell for about $14 a pound in stores.
Then again, your project could end a total failure because the success rate for first-time mushroom growers is just over 50 per cent.
Despite the chancy nature of a home-grown mushroom project, dozens of Mainers are successfully growing their own backyard gourmet mushrooms for pennies a pound. A few are cultivating Maine-grown mushrooms as a business. And none is more successful in this endeavor than Candice Heydon of Damariscotta.
Heydon, a native of Damariscotta who started growing mushrooms just four years ago, produces all she needs for great meals she enjoys with her husband Dan. Heydon also grows 500 to 600 pounds of mushrooms a year (and buys more from other growers) in a business called Oyster Creek Farm Mushroom Company. It grosses $50,000 a year by supplying mushrooms to Maine restaurants, stores, and customers overseas.
Most important of all for the would-be backyard mushroom grower in Maine, Heydon sells inexpensive shiitake mushroom spawn (the mushroom `seed') and how-to instructions.
There's big interest.
"When people ask how's business," she says, "we just tell them it's mushrooming."
On a hot and muggy day recently (the sort of day mushrooms love), I visited Dan and Candice Heydon at their modest owner-built house. It's set in a tract of shady oak woods. That's a fortunate circumstance because growers of shiitake mushrooms need oak logs.
Dan Heydon oversees orders and deliveries. Candice Heydon grows the mushrooms. A few simple outbuildings on their property provide shelter for Heydon, as she goes about tasks like inoculating logs with mushroom spawn. Beneath trees on the couple's property are impressive symmetrically stacked rows containing about 4,000 four-foot logs that will produce mushrooms in months to come.
For the hobbyist mushroom grower, out-buildings such as those owned by the Heydons are not necessary.
The things a hobbyist shiitake mushroom grower needs are freshly cut oak logs, mushroom spawn, a drill and 5/16-inch bit, a bit of paraffin wax, a garden hose, and some deeply shaded woodland for that just right mushroom-growing environment.
Here are the basic directions:
With a drill and 5/16-inch bit, make drill holes one inch deep in freshly cut oak logs. Space the holes four to six inches apart all around the logs, in a diamond pattern. Candice Heydon uses four-foot logs five to eight inches in diameter.
Gently hammer the mushroom spawn into the holes, then brush each hole with melted paraffin wax. Now stack the wood in a crib stack pattern in a deeply shaded place. Bottom logs in the pile should rest on cement blocks or rocks so the pile isn't in contact with the ground.
If you start your mushroom colony now, you could be harvesting late next summer, or as early as spring, 1998. But here's the catch. The logs have to be kept damp, and that means watering them once a week with approximately an inch of water, unless there's a soaking rain. Watering isn't unnecessary after hard frost, but logs must have shade (and protection from drying wind) even in winter.
If your project is a success, and you continue watering in warm weather, the logs may produce twice a year for four to five years.
But, says Heydon, don't count on it. "We don't guarantee success," she says, "but if you stay with it, you probably will succeed."
But do quell visions of quitting your job to grow mushrooms in Maine. Despite her $50,000 gross, Hayden still finds it necessary to supplement her income by cooking breakfast at a local restaurant.
"It's not a way to get rich quick," she says. "It's trial and error and it can be a tough business."

YARMOUTH CLAM FESTIVAL MAY DRAW 50,000 NEW FEATURES ARE EXPECTED TO COMPLEMENT THE TOWN'S THREE-DECADES-OLD TRADITION.

Full text:   with sidebar clam
After 31 years, the Yarmouth Clam Festival is a firmly ensconced local tradition.
But who says tradition can't be updated?
In addition to such perennial favorites as the craft show, the road race and concerts - and, of course, the clams - this year's festival will have a rubber duck race and a high-tech computer exhibit from DeLorme Mapping Co.
The festival, which may bring 50,000 people to town each day, begins at 10 a.m. Friday and continues through Sunday afternoon. The carnival rides opened Wednesday night, and will be open tonight from 6 to 10 p.m.
"On many levels, there's a lot of appeal (for the festival)," said Carolyn Schuster, who's organizing Friday's Clam Festival Parade. "If you like crafts, there's crafts. If you like music, there's music."
Linda Coleman of Yarmouth said the community aspect of the festival appeals to her. "There's no alcohol, which makes it really family-oriented. The music is wonderful, and it's outdoors."
The festival also brings Coleman's neighborhood together. She and her Pleasant Street neighbors are building a float based on the parade's theme, "Maine Goes to the Movies." Their float is based on the story of Andre, a Camden harbor seal that was featured in a 1994 movie.
"It will be fun, no matter what," she said. "It's the process that makes it worthwhile."
At the DeLorme exhibit, which runs all three days, visitors will be able to type their addresses into a computer, and the computer will find them on a map and mark them with tiny clams, said Sheri Wilson, administrative assistant in DeLorme's public relations department. The computer then will calculate the distance between each visitor's home and Yarmouth.
The Royal River Duck Dip, on Sunday afternoon, will let people sponsor a duck and then root for it as it floats down the river. "We always try to do something different," said Bill Goddard, co-director of the festival. Proceeds go to the Chamber of Commerce to help cover expenses.
The real stars of the show are still the clams.
"We couldn't do without all our food," said Goddard.
He reeled off some of the ways the little bivalves will be served up this weekend: fried clams, clams in batter, clams in crumbs, clam chowder . . .
Those who prefer other festival fare will be able to find lobster rolls, fried dough and strawberry shortcakes as well as lime rickeys, which are lime-flavored drinks purportedly made from a secret recipe.
Goddard said he and Joan Wilber, the co-director, have been working since January to ensure the festival's success, but there's one thing they can't guarantee: the weather.
But Goddard said he isn't worried. "We don't pay attention to that," he said bravely.
Good weather is predicted throughout the weekend. -------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- For more information, check out the Yarmouth Clam Festival's website at: http://www.propel. com/clamfest

Full text:   A year after 1,000 gallons of oil spilled into the Piscataqua River, most of the insurance claims have been settled and the lobstermen are back in business. But studies of the environmental impact, and planning to prevent a recurrence, continue.
The tanker Provence, registered in Malta, broke away from its moorings on July 1, 1996, as it was unloading a heavy fuel oil, No. 6, in Newington. The Coast Guard later concluded that the crew failed to tend the mooring lines, causing them to break when the tide rose.
The ship's captain also failed to familiarize himself with the terminal and with predicted tides and currents, the Coast Guard found.
The Port Safety Forum, a group governed by the Coast Guard, New Hampshire and Maine, has spent the year studying ship traffic in the river in hopes of preventing future spills, said Lt. Jeff Gafkjen. One result is a safety checklist.
"Mariners really need to be familiar with the river's tides and currents, as well as a number of other issues," Gafkjen said.
Though the spill was comparatively small, the heavy oil quickly sank to the river bottom. Environmentalists still are concerned about the effect on the delicate ecosystem of the tidal river and Great Bay, which branches off upriver.
Immediately after the spill, fishermen pulled oil-covered lobsters from the water and residents reported oily birds and plants along the shore. To date, studies have indicated the oil had no lasting impact on birds and mammals, or on oyster beds. Lobsters and crabs suffered in the short term; the long-term impact on them still is uncertain.
But Bruce Smith of the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said important studies of bottom-dwelling fish and other species remain unfinished for lack of funding from the shipping company.
State officials will meet next week with ECM/Hudson Maritime Services, the firm representing the tanker's owners, in an effort to resolve the dispute. "Mariners really need to be familiar with the river's tides and currents, as well as a number of other issues." Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Gafkjen

Full text:   The browntail moth caterpillar appears to be securing its foothold in Portland's northern suburbs, after plaguing residents of Casco Bay's islands for several years.
A recent aerial survey by the state shows the caterpillar infestation still hugging the coast, but doubling in intensity through portions of Falmouth Foreside, Cumberland Foreside, Yarmouth and Freeport.
Among the areas hardest hit this year are portions of Harpswell Neck, Bailey Island and Cousins Island.
The infestation is bad news for residents of those areas, who have seen their trees stripped of foliage and who may suffer from burning rashes and respiratory problems this year as a result of the browntail's microscopic hairs.
"We all have suffered from the rash," said Pam Adams, who lives on Cousins Island, which is part of Yarmouth. "One neighbor had to go into the hospital because he was having trouble breathing."
The appearance of the browntail moth on the mainland isn't new. The moth larvae have been spotted as far north as Gardiner since the insect first began to reappear in Maine in 1989.
But while still relatively small, the browntail population on the mainland has shown a strong shift to the northern part of Casco Bay, said Richard Bradbury, a Maine Forest Service entomologist.
In all, about 300 acres on the mainland have been defoliated by the caterpillar - about double the amount last year.
"People are scratching enough now that they're starting to notice," Bradbury said.
The down-easterly shift tends to follow the pattern of prevailing winds. July is when the caterpillars turn into white-winged moths that begin laying their eggs for next season. Those eggs are dropped wherever the wind tends to blow the moths, said Jeff Tarling, arborist for the city of Portland.
James Phipps, a Cumberland town councilor who lives on Chebeague Island, said he's received several calls from people complaining of the browntail moth in places it hasn't been found before.
"It's been evident west of Interstate 295," Phipps said. "And I've heard that it's become an issue around the playgrounds and the schools."
The moths are currently ending their larvae stage. And while the tiny caterpillar hairsremain in the trees, a few good rainstorms like the one that hit southern Maine on Wednesday will wash away most of the problems for the summer.
Still, the caterpillars will return next spring - and that has some mainland residents, like Bob Crowley of South Portland, calling for increased spraying to eradicate the browntail.
Crowley, a high school physics teacher who owns a camp on Stave Island, said the population growth of the browntail appears to mirror the original spread of the moth into New England in 1897.
He has been lobbying the state to begin a comprehensive spraying program to destroy the browntail before somebody gets sick and dies.
"The more people that you expose to this the higher the chances that somebody's going to die," Crowley said.
Bradbury, however, maintains the issue of spraying is a local issue to be decided by residents, not the state, because so many people oppose the idea of spraying pesticides.
"People really have to come to terms locally," he said. "It's not something where the state can move in and wave a magic wand."
On Cousins Island, Hall coordinated an effort among 30 of her neighbors to spray the area surrounding their homes. As a result, she said, their portion of the island has remained relatively rash-free this summer.
Nathaniel Tupper, Yarmouth's town manager, said the town would be willing to sponsor another meeting between residents and state officials to talk about the browntail.
But as of right now, he said, there are no plans to take the idea of spraying to the Town Council.
Phipps said the Cumberland Town Council won't endorse aerial spraying, although individual neighborhoods may take matters into their own hands.
Spraying is controversial because the pesticide used to kill browntail moths, Dimilin, can harm lobsters and other shellfish, and its long-term effects on human health and the environment are unknown.
Researchers hope, however, that the pesticide can be replaced next spring by a bacterial spray that is engineered specifically to kill the browntail moth and won't harm marine life or the environment.
Tests of the bacterial insecticide in May over nine acres on Peaks Island showed it was highly effective in killing the moth, said Normand Dubois, a U.S. Forest Service microbiologist.
"Hopefully by next year we'll have the dose and volumes worked out to make it feasible," he said. "People are scratching enough now that they're starting to notice." Richard Bradbury, Maine Forest Service

GROUPS PUSH FOR WATER TESTING AT BEACHES ONLY A FEW OF THE STATE'S SWIMMING AREAS ARE REGULARLY TESTED FOR BACTERIA CONTAMINATION.

Full text:   Mainers and tourists flocking to the state's beaches this summer shouldn't assume the water is clean, according to national environmental groups pushing for better testing and reporting.
Only a few of Maine's beaches are regularly tested for bacteria contamination that could make bathers ill, said Robin Eisemen of the Public Interest Research Group.
"People literally don't know what they're getting into when they go swimming," said Eiseman. "The public has a right to safe and clean beaches, and a right to know if their beaches are safe and clean."
Eiseman on Tuesday released a national report on beach monitoring and pollution and said it shows the need for better testing to safeguard public health. The Natural Resources Defense Council, conducting the survey for the seventh year, found there were more than 2,500 beach closings and advisories around the country last year while other stretches of coastline were never tested.
Pathogens in sewage-contaminated water can cause gastroenteritis, dysentery, ear, nose and throat problems and respiratory illness, according to the report.
Spotty monitoring and the lack of advisories frequently are at issue in Maine after a flood or major rainstorm when raw sewage and polluted runoff foul coastal waters. Even then, however, most beaches are not tested and advisories are not posted.
Maine has no statewide program for monitoring beaches or warning swimmers. Only a few municipalities have taken on the role.
The report released Tuesday does not claim Maine's waters are dirty or dangerous. In fact, it cites a 1996 state report that water quality overall has improved in Maine while bacteria continues to contaminate shellfish beds and estuaries.
But if there were a pollution problem, it says, bathers probably wouldn't know about it.
"July 4th weekend should be a time when we can go to the beach to relax and enjoy the water," said Eiseman. PIRG is supporting federal legislation to require better monitoring by states, she said. The expense would be worthwhile because of Maine's dependence on coastal recreation and tourism, she said.
Portland and South Portland, which have public beaches near sewage outfalls, regularly test the water at their public beaches. Old Orchard Beach and Ogunquit also occasionally test water samples, the report said.
Portland tests the water at the East End Beach three times a week and posts advisories depending on the bacteria levels. The sign on Tuesday said water quality was acceptable.
Portland has permanently posted an advisory that water may not meet state health standards at the beaches on Peaks Island. Quality there has historically been erratic but is steadily improving as more homes are connected to the island's sewage treatment plant, according to the city.
Most Maine beaches, however, are not monitored.
"If anybody has a question, the Department of Environmental Protection will come and test," said John Scott, manager at Crescent Beach State Park in Cape Elizabeth. "They have in the past and nothing's ever been wrong."
Even though only a handful of beaches are tested in Maine, the state falls into the middle of the nationwide survey. Some states - including North Carolina and South Carolina - do not regularly test any beaches. Seven states - including New Hampshire and New Jersey - monitor all their beaches, according to the report. "People literally don't know what they're getting into when they go swimming."

Through Sept. 13
'Legends, Lies and Local History'
Downtown Bar Harbor
Much of what makes Bar Harbor special are the landscapes and seascapes just beyond the town limits. But people have been visiting the Mount Desert Island area for one reason oranother for 6,000 years, so it's certain the town of Bar Harbor harbors considerable history. "Legends, Lies, and Local History" represents a pair of walking tours that offer participants both the scenic and historic sides of one of the nation's top summertime destinations. The walking tours last up to two hours, and begin at 10 a.m. every Tuesday through Saturday at the clock on the village green. One walk tours involve the town's historic district and a second trek follows a shore path. The program begins with a 10- to 15-minute talk about Bar Harbor's history, including "what's not there," that traces the history of various landmarks that no longer exist. There is a fee, and more information is available by calling 288-8103.
July 7
Fleet of windjammers
Bucks Harbor
Nine of Maine's historic windjammers will be open for public inspection in this cozy Washington County port to celebrate The Maine Windjammer Association's 25th anniversary. One highlight are tours throughout the afternoon of a fleet of one of three of America's oldest commercial schooners from the 1800s, an oyster schooner, a pilot boat, a three-masted ram schooner, a racing yacht and two new vessels built specifically for windjamming. An evening street dance will feature Flash in the Pans, a steel drum band. Call 800-807-WIND for more information.
July 11-13
Sea Kayak Symposium
Maine Maritime Academy, Castine
The oldest event of its kind in the United States, this L.L. Bean-sponsored event features some of the world's leading experts providing instruction for novice and experienced sea kayakers alike. Subjects such as selecting a kayak, trip planning, dressing for paddling, places to paddle in Maine and basic kayak navigation will be discussed during talks and seminars. On-water instruction and demonstrations also are scheduled. There is a registration fee, and costs for accommodations and meals are additional and must be arranged in advance. For more information, call 800-341-4341, ext. 6666.
July 17-20
Harrington Bicentennial
U.S. Route 1, Harrington
The town of Harrington was incorporated on June 17, 1797 - using a name made available when Maine's original Harrington opted to change its name to Augusta. Harrington went on to develop a strong shipbuilding tradition, a tradition that is being honored during this summer's recognition of the town's 200th birthday. That recognition comes to a head with several days of activity in mid-July. A youth pageant, barn dance and wiffle ball tournament kick off the celebration before the big day of the gala, July 19. A grand parade is scheduled for Main Street at 2 p.m., immediately followed by a ceremony marking the town's incorporation. Other activities during the day include a pancake breakfast, foot race, antique car show, a lobster and clam bake, crafts fair and field games for the kids. In the evening, there's beano and fireworks. Call 483-4097 for more information.
July 19-20
Maine Coast Carving Show
High Street, Belfast
Wood carving is an art form centuries old, yet itcontinues to be an opportunity for modern expression. Carvings both modern and traditional will be on display as well as competing for prizes during this two-day showing in the Abbott Room of the Belfast Free Library. Caricatures, birds, ornaments, Maine-related carvings and interpretative works will be displayed by an anticipated 150 participants from Maine and northern New England. The show coincides with the Belfast Bay Festival and is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and 9-5 on Sunday. Call 338-5309.
July 20
Down East Antiques Fair
Blue Hill Fairgrounds
Combine breathtaking views of the Down East coast with a wide variety of antiques made available by some 60 dealers from throughout Maine and New England, and this eighth annual event can't help but be a popular destination point for a summery Sunday. This antiques fair, which benefits the Katahdin Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, will be held both indoors and outdoors from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Twelve hundred buyers - locals, tourists and "summer people" alike - checked out last year's fair on the Blue Hill peninsula. For more information, call 866-2241.

Full text: Correction published Sunday, June 29, 1997: Philip Carlsen, a Maine composer, was incorrectly referred to as Philip Larsen in a story about the summer classical music season last Sunday on Page 1 of the Audience section. It was a reporter's error.
Classical music long has been one of the most tried-and-true art forms. That's good andbad.
Good because it keeps audiences coming back. They know what to expect - works by the great composers. Bad because it keeps new, especially younger, audiences away and stagnates the genre.
Several of Maine's summer classical music festivals are trying to break the mold. The festivals are still dominated by the big boys - Bach, Brahms, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Mendelssohn and Handel - but here and there are programs that avoid the predictable.
Leafing through this year's schedulesone finds programs of American song, works by living composers - including a few world premieres - and evenings devoted to that musical upstart, jazz. Bay Chamber Concerts has the audacity to program Ravel along with Carmichael (Hoagy, that is).
Some of these excursions, such as adding vocals, come in response to audience requests. You can find singing on a number of programs this summer, ranging from Cole Porter's "The Tale of the Oyster" at the Mt. Desert Festival of Chamber Music to Mendelssohn's "Five Songs" at the Bay Chamber Concerts.
Others detours from the expected are made by programming directors set on expanding the horizons of classical music and introducing their audiences to contemporary works, which most people mistakenly associate with atonal caterwauling.
"(Contemporary music) brings fresh life to what we are doing," says Lewis Kaplan, artistic director of the Bowdoin Summer Music Festival.
The Gamper Festival, a mini-festival within the Bowdoin Summer Music Festival, is devoted entirely to contemporary works. This year, the festival presents works by Sebastian Currier, Pater Askim, Robert Beaser, David Leisner and Bowdoin's Elliot Schwartz.
The smaller festival has had its influence on the Bowdoin festival as a whole. Contemporary works are a regular part of the Wednesday night "Upbeat Series." This year, the Friday night concerts, the centerpiece of the festival, highlight two romantics, Brahms and Gerswhin, but tucked into the six programs are two current works.
George Crumb's "Night of the Four Moons" will be performed July 11. The piece was written a week after the first moon landing, in July 1969, and is performed by soprano, flute, cello, musical saw, banjo and percussion. As the theatrical piece progresses, musicians leave one by one until there is only one left. Crumb, a Pulitzer Prize-winner who is considered one of the country's leading contemporary composers, will conduct his composition.
A Crumb composition is also on the outdoor family concert,July 6. As the title implies, "Voice of the Whale" calls on the musicians and singers to sound like the deep sea mammal.
On July 18, the festival hosts the world premiere of Sebastian Currier's "Chamber Concerto for Violin and String Orchestra." Currier, a rising young composer, has created a three-movement work that is intense and dramatic, Kaplan says.
Francis Fortier has devoted one evening of the Bar Harbor Music Festival, now starting its 31st season, to works by living composers since 1984.
"We've never filled the house for the program, and we're only talking 200 seats," Fortier says. "But people who have come here skeptically have walked out on cloud nine because of the excitement of the work and the presence of the composers."
For that reason, Fortier considers the program a crucial element of the festival, which he describes as being devoted to music, not just classical music. This year, the program (July 25) will feature works by two South American composers, Alba Lucia Potes and Osvaldo Lacerda, and two Americans, Edmund Cionek and Lois Dilvio.
Lacerda, a Brazilian, is one of South America's most prominent composers. Two pages are devoted to him in "Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians." Fortier describes his music as neo-romantic with Brazilian folk music influences, kind of a South American Aaron Copland.
In contrast, Potes, a Columbian, creates a far more abstract yet driving music. "There's a definite dynamo behind this music," Fortier says.
At 24, New Yorker Dilivio is by far the youngest of the four. Her piece is a world premiere, and Fortier describes it as very theatrical. The second movement, titled "Oklahoma City," was inspired by the bombing there. Cionek music is highly structured but runs the emotional gamut.
"It can wax sentimental one moment, then bounce you off into an episode of tongue-in-cheek," Fortier says. There will be a discussion among the four composers, and all will introduce their own pieces.
You'll also find contemporary works at the Portland Chamber Music Festival. Each of the four concerts includes a recent work. Michael Gandolfi will be on hand Aug. 17 to conduct his 1996 composition "Grooved Surfaces."
The Sebago-Long Lake Region Chamber Music Festival has commissioned Maine composer Philip Larsen to create a new work, "Landscape with Lady Slipper," to celebrate its 25th anniversary. Larsen teaches at the University of Maine at Farmington. The National Symphony Orchestra will premiere another of Larsen's works this fall at the Kennedy Center.
The newest work on the program at the Mt. Desert Festival of Chamber Music is "Mama Called," a recent song by flutist Gary Schocker.
"It's a humorous ditty about a cat and a single woman," says Todd Crow, a pianist who has performed at the festival for years. This season is his first as the artistic director.
American song isn't usual chamber music festival fare, but Crow wants to expand the repertoire. To that end, he has added songs by Charles Ives, Samuel Barber, William Flanagan, Cole Porter and Schocker to a program of Brahms, Schubert and Haydn.

Selectmen had scheduled the meeting to adopt a plan for using the former Navy fuel depot, but the most controversial article may the proposed amendments to the town's animal control ordinance. The amendments would require cats to be registered and would stiffen fines for violations of the ordinance.
Also on the warrant are articles that would: establish looser requirements for a quorum at special town meetings, switch from an appointed to an elected planning board, create an exception to the shoreland zoning ordinance for single-family homes and authorize selectmen to spend $27,900 on a computer system for the town office using money left over from the annual town meeting.
The special town meeting is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Monday at the Harpswell Islands School on Route 24.
According to Selectman Gordon Weil, the changes to the animal control ordinance are a response to the rabies epidemic sweeping through New England. Cat owners would have to prove their animals were vaccinated before they could be registered. The registration would cost up to $5.
Town Clerk LaVern Vayo opposes the idea. She said she has enough trouble keeping up with registrations of the town's 700 dogs and the town has no animal control officer to enforce the ordinance. That job falls to the shellfish wardens.
"This is soundly defeated by the Legislature each time it's brought up," Vayo said. "We have a good state animal welfare department. When they feel it's necessary, they'll put it in the state law."
That probably won't happen for a long time. According to Shelley Toppan, director of animal health and industry at the state Department of Agriculture, Maine is attempting to attack rabies through education rather than legislative mandates.
But she said Harpswell's proposal isn't a bad idea.
"It's important to know that cats are out and about and are more likely to contract rabies than dogs," she said.
The state requires the registration of dogs, which costs $4 if the animal is neutered or spayed and $7.50 if it is not. A portion of each fee the town collects is forwarded to the state. The town would be able to keep all the cat registration fees it collects.
The proposal also seeks to increase fines for dog owners who violate any section of the ordinance. The current ordinance sets $100 as the maximum penalty for a second offense. The proposed change would establish $100 as the lowest possible fine, and the fine would not be suspendable.
Likewise, if voters on Monday establish a new quorum for special town meetings, they would be unable to waive the rule as they have in the past.
Currently, special town meetings must be attended by at least 10 percent of the number of registered voters who voted in the last gubernatorial election; if fewer attend, no decisions are valid. But the quorum requirement frequently is waived when too few people show up, Weil said.
The proposed change would require, without exception, that the meeting be attended by at least 10 percent of the number of voters who participated in the last annual town meeting, which is a much smaller number.
Another ordinance change, the inclusion of a special exception to the shoreland zoning ordinance, would allow the construction of single-family homes in the resource protection district as long as the builder meets certain requirements.
Roland Mayo, the codes enforcement officer, said this would make the town's ordinance a little more lenient, incorporating guidelines the state has used for several years.
The article to elect the town's planning board members, rather than have the selectmen appoint them, was proposed by Arthur G. Powers. Powers said he served four years as an elected planning board member and believes that is the fairest, most democratic process.
The planning board was created in 1972 as an appointed board. Voters at town meeting changed it to an elected position in 1989, then reversed themselves in 1994 when there was a problem attracting candidates. "It's important to know that cats are out and about and are more likely to contract rabies than dogs." Shelley Toppan, state director of animal health and industry

POLITICAL NEWCOMER OUSTS KENNEBUNK SELECTMAN

Full text: A long-time Kennebunk selectman was ousted Tuesday night by a political newcomer who got more votes than any of her three opponents.
Boyd Long, who's served as a selectman 12 years, was defeated by Rachel Phipps. She came back from a loss in her first selectmen's bid last January to fill the remainder of the term of the late Dorothy Stevens.
Long, who received 402 votes, called his loss "very disappointing." He said he and his supporters simply hadn't tried hard enough to get voters to the polls.
Not serving as a selectman "will leave a big void in my life," said Long, who is chairman of the board. "I will miss representing the town." He was the first non-native resident ever elected.
Phipps, who received 536 votes, was elected to one of the three-year terms decided Tuesday. Jack Libby, with 475 votes, also won a full term. He defeated Phipps in January for a partial term.
Wesley Crowell received 383 votes.
In the Kennebunk School Board contest, EstelleWellman, David Jones and Thomas Moyer were elected. Wellman received 520 votes; Jones, 462; and Moyer, 466. Defeated were Peter Field, 314; Richard Heikkinen, 392; and Lucinda Nieuwkerk, 435.
In other results Tuesday night:
In Berwick, one vote decided the winner of a two-way race for a seat on the SAD 60 board of directors. Geoffrey Day defeated Gary Branyen, 409 to 408. Town Clerk Barbara Martin said a recount may be requested.
In the Berwick selectmen's race, Thomas Lavigne and Eleanor Murphy were elected. Lavigne got 414 votes; Murphy, 507. They defeated Samuel Mathews, with 204 votes; Kenneth Poirier, 280; and Thomas Wright, 250.
Four Berwick referendum questions on amending town ordinances were all adopted.
In Ogunquit, voters overwhelmingly defeated an ordinance banning dogs along the banks of the Ogunquit River during the summer.
Nearly 100 voters rejected the article by a show of hands, following a 35-minute discussion.
Isabel Lewando, a spokeswoman for the Ogunquit Shellfish Conservation Commission, felt the ordinance would cause more pollution to the local clam flats. She was pleased with Tuesday night's vote.
Commission members said the ordinance, which would have replaced an existing ordinance governing dog use of the riverbanks, would actually have expanded dogs' use of the riverbank.
Lewando said if the current ordinance were enforced, there would be no reason for a new one. She and the commission believe that the current ordinance already prohibits dogs from the riverbank.

Full text: Residents at tonight's special town meeting will consider banning dogs along the banks of the Ogunquit River during the summer.
The river opens into clamflats that were recently reopened for limited clamming. Members of the Ogunquit Shellfish Conservation Commission wanted to reduce the number of dogs that run with their owners along the river; they say the dog excrement that results could contaminate the flats.
And they believe the proposed ordinance, which would replace an existing ordinance governing dog use of the riverbanks, would actually expand the rights of dogs to use the riverbank.
The meeting is at 7 p.m. at town hall.
Isabel Lewando, a spokeswoman for the commission, believes dogs should be banned from the river year-round to protect the rich clam flats.
The town's current ordinance prohibits dogs from the riverbank, the commission believes.
"All we've done to protect the flats could be for naught because of this (proposed) ordinance," Lewando said.
Police Chief Michael Pardue said the proposed rule is a compromise between those who want more freedom for dogs and those who claim that dogs are taking over the town.
But the shellfish commissionbelieves that town officials are actually making it easier to have dogs near the clam flats.
The proposed ordinance would allow dogs along the river during the winter as long as they are on a leash or under voice command.
Ogunquit, with 976 year-round residents, sees its population grow by the thousands during the summer. Along with the tourists come their dogs.
Selectmen said they receive more complaints about dog droppings than any other issue in town.
The town has 96 dogs licensed with the town.
Until this spring, pollution in the flats prevented clam digging for 10 years at the mouth of the Ogunquit River. Tests done recently showed the flats are clean, and the state Department of Marine Resources gave the go-ahead for weekend and holiday digging by residents.
Lewando fears progress made in cleaning the flats may soon be lost.
Clam bed pollution, which experts have long thought came from failed septic systems, actually comes more from "pets, primarily dogs," Lewando said, citing a University of Massachusetts study done over a three-year period.
"The argument here is it does not make sense to use clam-flat areas as a dog toilet," she said. "All we've done to protect the flats could be for naught because of this (proposed) ordinance." Isabel Lewando, shellfish commission member

COMPANY EXPORTING WHELKS CAUGHT IN MAINE TO KOREA STATE MARINE OFFICIALS ARE TAKING A FRIENDLY BUT CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO THE NEW FISHERY.

Full text: A Korean company has ushered in an unlikely new industry at the end of a Portland pier.
Iceland Corp. is processing tons of whelks - meat-eating sea snails caught in Maine waters - that have long been ignored by both fishermen and scientists.
The company buys a few thousand pounds of the mollusks each week from Maine lobstermen, who typically find them rattling around in their traps. Equipment worth about $500,000 is used to cook and crush the shells off the whelks, and then six or seven processors clean and freeze them for Korean food markets.
Iceland Corp. Vice President Ken Peterson said this is just the beginning.
The company hopes to equip and train a small fleet of fishermen to go out just to trap whelks. It wants to process 20,000 to 40,000 pounds a day - that's 90,000 to 180,000 snails - at the Custom House Wharf plant.
To Peterson, a handful of egg-sized whelks stretching out of their shells is an overlooked resource.
"Beautiful, huh?" he asked.
To state officials, however, the company's high hopes are reason for concern. The Department of Marine Resources already has stepped in to make sure the new whelk industry isn't too successful too fast.
Pete Thayer, a state marine biologist, has seen other newfound marine treasures become the focus of boom-and-bust industries that take their toll both on fishermen and the ocean.
"We want them to make it," Thayer said of the whelk harvesters, "but we don't want to see the thing die out in a couple of years, either."
The trouble is that no one is sure how many whelks are out there, sliding across rocks or burrowing in the sandy floor of the Gulf of Maine. No one knows how fast they reproduce, either.
It never seemed important to know those things - until now.
"It's really surprising," said Thayer, who found virtually no existing data in the United States. "You'd think that everything's been poked or prodded at this point."
Fishermen know as much as anyone about the whelks, sometimes called "conchs" or "snots."
Some lobstermen have been bringing whelks ashore for years, supplying a small East Coast ethnic market and a small number of coastal Mainers who have an appetite for pickled whelk.
Whelks are meat-eating snails with shells as long as 3 1/2 inches that spiral to a pointy end. At least six types can be found in the Gulf of Maine. The one most commonly caught is the wave whelk.
They live on the sand or gravel of the ocean bottom and eat the flesh of dead fish, such as the bait used to attract lobsters. Urchin divers see a lot of them, according to Peterson.
"From all indications, they're plentiful," he said.
The company has been working to set up the plant for the past year and is continuing to work with state officials to set up fishing limits that aren't so strict they ruin his company's investment.
Iceland thinks the state is being overly cautious, and plans to help scientists figure out how many whelks there are and how fast they can be harvested, Peterson said.
"This thing, I think, is going to last years and years," he said.
Processing whelks
One day last week, buyers stationed along the coast shipped about 4,000 pounds bought from lobstermen.
The whelks were put into large stainless steel vessels for a fresh-water rinse, then, still inside their shells, given a conveyer-belt ride to a 212-degree oven. After cooking, they were rolled into the crusher, which cracked open the shells and then separated the chips from the cooked flesh.
A couple of processors, wearing white hairnets, lab coats and plastic gloves, pulled off the remaining round chip of shell usedby the whelks to seal themselves inside. Others took off the whelk's heads and digestive organs, leaving only the fleshy pad, or feet, once used by the snail to slide on the ocean bottom.
The Portland workers freeze them and ship them to Seoul, where the meat is cooked again and canned.
Ten pounds of snails pulled out of the ocean - which might earn about $2.50 for the fishermen - turns into 1.6 pounds of meat. Peterson would not say how much the meat sells for in Korea.
Iceland is now offeringto supply fishermen with special whelk traps: six-gallon plastic chambers with a whole in the top. Whelks slide onto the top and fall through a hole to get at the dead fish anchored inside. Then, they can't get out.
State is cautious
The whelk fishing business seems to be starting slowly, and few fishermen so far are going out just for the snails. With four or five whelks to a pound and each pound getting about 25 cents, there isn't much incentive.
"You need to have an awful lot to make a good day's pay," said Mickey Varian at Sebasco Wharf, a Phippsburg dealer who buys whelks for Iceland. "As soon as some fishermen see that it could be a viable business, they'll jump on the bandwagon."
The sluggish start might offer some relief to state Marine Resources officials, who feared another gold rush like the one that followed the arrival of sea urchin processors in the late 1980s. The catch started to drop by 1994, before scientists studied the capacity of the resource.
"We want to go about this slowly and we were committed to not making the same mistake we did with urchins," said Maine Marine Patrol Lt. Dan Morris. "This is a fishery the department is trying to stay ahead of the curve on."
Last September, the state prohibited dragging with nets and diving for whelks, leaving the less-efficient traps as the only method for harvesting. The department also established minimum shell length of 2 1/2 inches, based on research in Canada that suggests the whelks can reproduce when they reach about 2 inches in size.
"We pulled together what we could," Thayer said. "What little we do know about them is based on studies in Canada and other parts of the world."
The experience of foreign countries is reason for concern, he said.
"Sometimes, even with minimal fishing pressure, the populations take a serious hit pretty quickly," he said.
Everyone would like to find a new business for the fishermen who got caught in the boom-and-bust cycles of urchins and groundfish. The state truly wants Iceland to succeed, Thayer said.
Thayer is now seeking grant money to begin studying the whelks in the Gulf of Maine. In the meantime, he said, the state will maintain its cautious approach.
"We want to at least give our regulations a chance," he said.

CATERPILLAR BATTLE AIDED BY NEW LAW PORTLAND CAN NOW SPRAY PESTICIDE ON ITS CASCO BAY ISLANDS WITHOUT WRITTEN CONSENT FROM LANDOWNERS.

Full text:   Aided by a new state law, the city of Portland will try again this spring to eradicate the browntail moth from its Casco Bay islands.
An emergency measure approved by the Legislature last week will allow the city to have large portions of the islands sprayed with pesticide, without written consent from property owners.
People who object to the spraying can still refuse to have their land sprayed, but the new law puts the burden on owners to tell the city of their objections.
Browntail moth caterpillars haveinfested the islands and other coastal areas in southern Maine since 1989. They defoliate trees, and pose significant health risks because their tiny hairs cause skin rashes and respiratory problems.
This will be the third year in which Portland has sprayed portions of the islands with Dimilin. The pesticide is considered safe for people and pets, but it has been controversial because it can harm shellfish and its long-term health effects aren't known.
Many residents on Peaks Island have refused tolet their property be sprayed.
Others just could not be reached to give their permission, said Larry Mead, executive assistant to the city manager.
"In the past we've had to track down every single property owner," he said. "In many cases it's vacant land, and the ownership is very distant. A lot of times we traced them down to a post office box or a trust.
"Last year we could only spray the Torrington Point section of Peaks Island," Mead said, "even though the whole island was infested with browntails."
Under the new state law, the city may spray areas declared a "health nuisance" unless the property owners say they won't allow it.
Four of Portland's five islands, Peaks, Cushing, Little Diamond and House, have been declared health nuisances by Dora Ann Mills, director of the Bureau of Public Health.
This spring, the city again notified property owners of the spraying. On Peaks Island, only about 3 to 4 percent of the approximately 800 respondents said they don't want their property sprayed, Mead said. That means a great deal more of the island will be sprayed this year.
Weather permitting, M.S. Lavoie Air Applicator will start the spraying Tuesday over portions of Peaks, Cushing, Little Diamond and House islands.
Spraying will be done early in the morning, starting around 5 a.m., over the next week. Residents should stay indoors during the spraying and keep their windows closed. No pesticide will be sprayed within 100 feet of the shores.
Richard Swarts, who retired to Peaks Island five years ago, said this is the worst year he's seen for browntails.
"We're hoping that the spray will take care of it," he said. "It absolutely needs to be done.
"It's a real pestilence," Swarts said. "I got a terrible asthma attack from ingesting the quills from the browntail. I know numerous people who got asthma attacks and terrible rashes. In fact, one of my neighbors isn't coming back to the island because she was so affected."
Elizabeth Rudenberg, the doctor at the Peaks Island Health Center, said she is an environmentalist at heart, but she feels the spraying is worth doing over a short term.
"Over the past six years, since I've been going out there, the problem with the caterpillar has shown itself to be progressively worse. Many people are emotionally distraught over the health effects."
About 70 percent of the people who come into contact with the hairs of the caterpillars develop a skin rash, Mead said. About 20 percent have breathing difficulties, and some have respiratory problems that linger for months.
Two years of spraying on Great Diamond, where residents consented to spraying nearly unanimously, has been successful, Mead said.
"We don't need to spray there this year," he said. "The feedback we got from residents last year is, `What a difference.' " "I know numerous people who got asthma attacks and terrible rashes. In fact, one of my neighbors isn't coming back to the island because she was so affected." Richard Swarts, Peaks Island resident

Gordon Gerry died last spring, but his contributions to many organizations in the town of York - especially the Chamber of Commerce - continue to benefit the community.
The York Chamber of Commerce felt so strongly about his involvement that they have created an award in his name. It will be given annually to the Visitor's Center volunteer who best exemplifies the attributes that Gerry demonstrated in service to his community.
The list of Gerry's accomplishments is long. He volunteered for the Chamber as a civic member, support staffer, special events worker and handyman at the Visitor's Center. He was an active member and past president of the York Lions Club.
Gerry served his town in a variety of ways. He was on the Goodrich Park Committee, the Shellfish Commission, the Conservation Commission and the York Village Fire Department, and he was the dog officer.
He was also active in the First Parish Church, helping with such activities as the Parish House Committee and the Parsonage Committee, and working on various public affairs such as summer breakfasts, bean suppers, fairs and antique shows.
The list goes on.
But what was this person like who gave so much of himself to his community? His widow, Dorothy, perhaps says it best when she says, "Gordon was very special." And his stepdaughter said at his funeral that he was "the best thing that ever happened to my mother and my family.
Gordon Gerry served in the Navy from 1954 to 1964 and later worked as an electrician. But his life seems to have been devoted to his community. He loved people, and he loved his town. He was a devotee of Maine humor and liked to regale his friends with stories in the appropriate dialect - either a Maine twang or and Irish brogue.
The York Chamber of Commerce has many functions for which it needs volunteers, such as serving as ambassador to the town's visitors, and working with staff and other volunteers as a member of the Chamber's team. If interested, call Cathy Goodwin at 363-4422.
Volunteer! York County, a program of the United Way of York County, connects volunteers with community needs. Additional volunteer opportunities include:
Serving as a host family with the International Education Forum. Host a Spanish/English speaking foreign exchange student for one month. Call Jessica Orzech at 985-6450 for more information.
The Biddeford Senior Dining Center, a Meals on Wheels site, is looking for a volunteer dishwasher. Help is needed any day, Monday through Friday, 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Call Cecile Greenleaf at 283-2477 for details.
The town of Sanford is looking for volunteer assistance in the office on Fridays this summer. For more information, callMargaret Moreland at 324-9106.
To learn more call Volunteer! York County at 985-6869 or 1-800-794-6896.

Full text: Diane Cowan was just looking for a place to launch her kayak when she walked onto the rocky beach at Lowell's Cove in 1992.
But what she found here changed her life. Soon, she hopes, her discovery will be the focus of a new monitoring effort along Maine's coast.
Cowan, an outgoing 36-year-old with natural curiosity and a Ph.D. in marine biology, saw two young boys poking around the rocks at low tide.
"I said, `Hey, what are you boys doing?' They said, `We're playing with the baby lobsters.' "
Cowan never did go kayaking. "I've been playing with the baby lobsters ever since," she said.
More than four years later, as the ocean receded during the last spring tide, Cowan scoured the cove, meter by meter, counting and measuring the young lobsters and inserting tiny magnetic tags into their legs.
"Cute little buggers, aren't they?" said Cowan, peering under a rock at three lobsters, each three or four inches long.
For Cowan, beachcombing is both fun and serious science.
Her work is underscoring the value of beaches all along the coast as little-known nursery areas for Maine's premier marine critter. Along with broadening knowledge of the lobster's life cycle, Cowan plans to build a volunteer network of baby lobster monitors - from kids to lobstermen - to keep an eye on the health of the resource and to help predict its future vitality and value.
Along with other Maine research on lobster life cycles, Cowan's work may soon play a role in industry management. It could impact local fishermen's decisions about whether to invest in new equipment or hold off, said David Cousens, a lobsterman from South Thomaston and president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association.
"We'll have some idea seven years down the road whether we're going to have a good harvest or not," he said. "It'll be good information to have."
Cowan last week earned nonprofit status for her Lobster Conservancy - which is composed of her, and a volunteer board of directors. A new grant from the Davis Conservation Foundation will help her train her first teams of volunteer census takers around the coastline of Harpswell.
"The idea is to have eyes all over the coastline to look at baby lobsters," she said.
It's a goal Cowan did not have when she came to Maine to teach at Bates College in 1992.
Cowan had studied lobsters since 1983, most recently at Woods Hole Marine Biological Lab. Her dissertation for Boston University exposed the sex lives of lobsters and got the attention of Discover Magazine and the Today Show in the late 1980s.
But Cowan almost couldn't believe what the two boys, sons of local lobstermen, took for granted at Lowell's Cove.
"This defies everything I ever learned. Lobsters on the shore living together under rocks?" she asks.
She and her Bates students soon found out that the cove is not unique - rocky beaches from Down East Maine to Connecticut are home to the crayfish-sized lobsters.
While not unique, Lowell's Cove is still special to Cowan.
She has combed the beach in rubber boots and rubber gloves during the lowest tides of each month - no matter what time or weather - for the four and a half years.
She also has spent tedious hours transcribing her notes, reading tags, mapping the beach and crunching the data into trend charts that yield new information about lobsters.
Cowan also rearranged her life around the cove, and the lowest tides.
She eventually gave up college teaching and moved into the small fishing community on Orrs Island. Cowan fit in by pitching in: building wooden skiffs, substituting as a sternman on local lobster boats and waitressing at Cook's Lobster House. She's still waitressing to support herself - and sometimes her research.
"The only job that will schedule me around the tides is the jobI have and I won't give up the tides," she said. "I'm trained as a scientist, and I want to do science."
She's never gotten paid, although a couple of earlier grants helped buy some equipment.
A trained eye
On a recent early morning, as a new moon pulled the tide extra low, Cowan scrambled over the rocks at the water line.
The only sounds were the chirping of birds, the screech of a gull, the slap of tiny waves on the rocky beach and Cowan's voice as she lifted rocks and described whatshe saw to a tape-recorder hidden in her vest pocket.
"Barnacles, oyster, green crab . . ." She found baby fish, starfish and, frequently, baby lobsters.
Cowan has a trained eye. She can tell which rocks are hiding lobsters even before she lifts them, based on the location on the beach or whether there is a telltale mound of sand dug out for a lobster burrow.
Yet she's still intrigued by their presence, and how they share rocks for shelter. "That's one of the surprising things I've found here," Cowan said. "I've found eight under one rock, and they're supposed to be solitary cannibals."
Cowan picks up each lobster, some of which pinch her rubber glove, and puts them on separate small trays. She records the size and makes other observations along with the number of the tag it will receive.
"Number 4639, 85 total length . . . Long antennae. Left crusher. Broken off tip of the rostrum that's healed."
She passes each one in front of a detector to see if it already has one of her small tags inside its shell. The machine beeps. "This one's back," she says.
Cowan has found about 7,000 lobsters here, and tagged nearly 4,700. Between 5 and 10 percent of the lobsters she finds have been tagged once.
Cowan uses a hyperdermic plunger to push the tiny splinter-like tags, each one milimeter long, into a small leg joint."This really doesn't seem to bother them in the least," she says.
Then she cuts a notch into a corresponding tail flipper so she'll know where the tag is if sheever finds that lobster again.
When she does get a "recapture" she pinches off the end of the leg with the tag and takes it home, where she'll use a microscope to read six rows of codes. Lobster are built to drop a limb without bleeding to death or feeling what we consider pain, she said.
With the tag, Cowan will know exactly when and where she had seen the lobster before, and be able to compare its size and appearance.
Handle with care
While Cowan wants people to know the lobsters are there, and even to help monitor them, she also wants people to treat them with care. (It's illegal to possess the lobsters, in fact.)
She puts each lobster back where she found it, careful not to drop the rocks too soon or too hard.
Jay Krouse of the Maine Department of Marine Resources has monitored intertidal lobsters off and on since the 1970s, and developed the tag technology used by Cowan. The department had not done a continual study of one habitat, however. Unlike Cowan, Krouse didn't seek volunteers.
"We were very discreet, almost secretive, about it," he said. "Most people don't realize that lobsters are there."
Krouse said he knows Cowan "has the welfare of the lobsters at heart." But he has mixed feelings about letting people know. Handling the rocks and lobsters improperly can cause damage. On the other hand, he said, people ought to know that the beaches are a valuable habitat that needs protection.
Cowan had the same concerns.
"I think it can do more good than harm," she said. "I don't think anybody knowingly damages habitat. It's kind of a matter of educating the public."
Cowan, in fact, wants to bring lobster research within easy reach of the coastal communities that know best how valuable the babies are. People who are naturally drawn to tidal pools and who rely on the resource can be trained to watch lobsters the same way volunteers now monitor water quality or clam flats, according to Cowan.
"This population can be monitored," she said. "It seemed like an obvious thing to do to me."
Lobstermen and their families, along with other local residents, already have been helping her track the lobsters at Lowell's Cove.
"They always knew the lobsters were there," she said.
She eventually hopes to broaden her research here by getting lobstermen to help monitor egg-bearing females - "these guys' moms" - while they haul traps.
"I feel very strongly that barrier between scientists and fishermen should be broken down." She's done that here already.

Marine biologist Diane Cowan, founder of the Lobster Conservancy, measures a baby lobster at Lowell's Cove at Orrs Island. The information will later be transcribed into a computer database and used for research. A baby lobster is measured and after a bar-coded chip is inserted in a claw joint, it will be put back under the rock where it was found. A miniscule bar-coded magnetic chip is inserted into the claw joint of the third leg of a baby lobster that will help researchers to identify it.

Full text: with sidebar Peco Energy
Philadelphia-based Peco Energy Co. hopes to buy Maine Yankee in what would be the nation's first sale of a nuclear power plant.
"We have had discussions with the owners for the possible purchase of Maine Yankee," Bill Jones, a spokesman for Peco Energy Co. told the Press Herald on Wednesday.
The talk about selling Maine Yankee is being driven by the deregulation of the power industry in the Northeast. Jones said it's too early to say whether it makes economic sense for Peco Energy to buy Maine Yankee, but the company might be interested if it looked like a bargain.
"If we were to purchase it," Jones said, "it would probably come at a low price."
Maine Yankee had declined Wednesday to name the company interested in taking over the troubled nuclear plant or discuss details of the possible sale.
Maine Yankee has proved costly to its current owners after nearly two years of technical and safety problems that have kept it out of service for much of that time. But Peco Energy has a track record of turning around troubled nuclear plants and believes it can make money here.
Power industry analysts agree the purchase of a nuclear plant could make economic sense, under certain circumstances.
"I think it's significant if someone is willing to step up to the plate and say, `You can make money with nuclear, if you can get it at the right price,' " said Ronald Tanner, a utility analyst with Legg Mason.
The sale of Maine Yankee also would improve the financial outlook for its lead owner, Central Maine Power Co. CMP has been spending roughly $1 million a week to buy replacement power while the reactor is off line.
The potential sale will be a hot topic of discussion this morning at CMP's annual meeting in Augusta. CMP plans a news conference following the meeting to discuss utility deregulation and other matters, including the sale.
Maine Yankee has been off line for safety reasons since Dec. 6. It's not likely to start up until at least midsummer.
It's also on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's list of the worst-run plants in the country. Now under a new management team, led by Entergy Corp. of New Orleans, the plant is spending more than $38 million to upgrade equipment and correct safety concerns.
Given these conditions, Maine Yankee might seem like a poor investment. But key factors could make it an attractive purchase, as New England states deregulate their utility industries.
A provision of deregulation bills in Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire requires investor-owned utilities to sell off their generation assets in the next few years. Early this month, CMP announced plans to sell all its power plants. Massachusetts-based New England Electric has done the same thing, and has already received bids for some of its units.
Getting a jump on divestiture and getting out from under the financial burden of Maine Yankee could be smart moves for CMP, Tanner, the analyst, said. A sale now would increase CMP's prospects for recovering its stranded costs - the contracts and investments utilities made in power-generating facilities that would become uncompetitive in a deregulated market.
"The earlier you quantify stranded costs," Tanner said, "the more likely you are to recover the money."
Setting a value for the sale of an operating nuclear plant would also be unprecedented in the United States. While some plants have had their licenses transferred to other operators, observers say, only General Public Utilities has actually put plants up for sale, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. No buyers have been reported for the Oyster Creek and Three Mile Island plants, although Peco has said it's also interested in those reactors.
Maine Yankee may also be a more attractive prospect now because of the improved outlook for its steam generators, which underwent a major repair in 1995. An inspection currently under way indicates the units are in good shape and don't seem to need expensive work.
These factors will be important to Peco, formerly known as Philadelphia Electric Co. Peco has become one of the nation's largest electric wholesalers. Under deregulation, the company could sell electricity from Maine Yankee throughout the region.
Peco operates four nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. It's the sole owner of the Limerick units and co-owner of the Peach Bottom plants. The company is largely credited with turning around poor operations at Peach Bottom, which includes a 1,035-megawatt reactor that is currently running at 100 percent capacity.
"Peach Bottom had a bad reputation 10 years ago," Jones said. "We made it what it is today."
Peco serves 1.5 million electric customers and 400,000 gas customers in the Philadelphia area. Last year, it bought a 5 percent share of the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire, gaining roughly 140 megawatts of capacity for $4 million. ____________________________________________________________________ __________

Abstract: The Glidden Midden, located at the tip of Glidden Point, is one of Maine's most significant prehistoric oyster shell heaps, called middens. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Owners George and Josephine Hart, who live on Glidden Point, donated 7.6 acres to the Damariscotta River Association to preserve the piles of shells. Thousands of middens can be found along the Maine coast, from Kittery to Eastport, but none is as large as the Glidden deposit. About 10 acres in size, it contains heaps of oyster shells 30 feet high and a hundred feet long, much of it overgrown with bushes and trees.

Full text:   A large ancient Indian shell deposit on the banks of the Damariscotta River, dating back 2,500 years, has been deeded to a local land trust.
The Glidden Midden, located at the tip of Glidden Point, is one of Maine's most significant prehistoric oyster shell heaps, called middens. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Owners George and Josephine Hart, who live on Glidden Point, donated 7.6 acres to the Damariscotta River Association to preserve the piles of shells.
"We're very pleased," Josephine Hart said. "It worries us to see them deteriorating. It's nice they're in good hands."
The property is part of a larger conservation easement contributed by the Harts in 1991 for protection of the upper river's natural environment. Before 1955, it belonged to the Gliddens of Boston, a prominent shipbuilding family that began summering in Maine in 1750.
Thousands of middens can be found along the Maine coast, from Kittery to Eastport, but none is as large as the Glidden deposit. About 10 acres in size, it contains heaps of oyster shells 30 feet high and a hundred feet long, much of it overgrown with bushes and trees.
Unknown tribes may have used the area as spring and winter headquarters, discarding the oyster shells and other refuse into piles that slowly built up over 1,500 years.
The most recent shells, at the top of the heap, are more than 500 years old.
High tides have taken a toll in recent years.
"During the last two winters, there has been a tremendous amount of erosion," said Peter Knauss, who heads the land trust. The group plans to erect unobtrusive barriers to minimize damage.
A century ago, a Boston company harvested shells from Whaleback Midden, on the opposite shore of the river.
A factory built on site in 1887 mined the shells for chicken feed, fertilizer, lime, and crushed material for driveways. The Glidden Midden was also partially excavated before the operation fell through.
According to state archeologist Arthur Spiess, pottery, stone and bone artifacts, wigwam floors and fire hearths found at Whaleback will probably be discovered in the Glidden Midden as well.
Sections of both middens are visible as a white layer near the waterline, where U.S. Route 1 crosses the Damariscotta River. But access is limited, according to Knauss.
People can view themiddens by boat. Or they can take the 3-mile Salt Bay Heritage Trial walk around Glidden Point, which starts across the street from the Lincoln County Publishing Co. on Mills Road and goes through the woods, along the shore and under Route 1 to the midden.
"We're so grateful to the Harts for entrusting it to us," said Knauss. "We hope to find funds to control the erosion and to help archeologists do an intensive study there in the years ahead."

Full text: By Gene Willard, captain, Casco Bay Ferry Lines
The great blue heron couldn't be missed Thursday morning as it flew alongside the Quickwater just above the surface, at our 20 mph pace. Without warning, it crossed the bow, gaining altitude and disappeared into the trees of Little Diamond Island.
In Hussey Sound, the southwesterly breeze and outgoing tide were creating gentle swells. Where the surf was hitting the shore of Crow Island, a flock of eider ducks were diving for shellfish churned up in the turbulence. Floating among them, a seagull was trying to blend in, and made several unsuccessful attempts to steal their grub.
Willard's observations appear Tuesday through Saturday, and in Casco Bay Online at: www.cascobay.com

Full text:   Wiscasset, Georgetown and the unorganized townships of Edmunds-Trescott in Washington County, have won a clam-seeding project sponsored by the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery.
Each will get a million tiny clams, worth $15,000, to seed their flats in June.
"We think it's great," said Wiscasset Code Enforcement Officer Stuart Wyman. "Nothing could be better for the commercial diggers."
The clams will be scattered over dozens of plots and monitored until they reach harvestable size, in an experiment to create a more sustainable fishery. Another 3 million clams will be delivered next year. The total value of the project to each town is $45,000.
The hatchery received 12 applications, from single towns and town coalitions, in three coastal areas.

Abstract: That remark captured [Lew] Dietz's modesty, despite a 60-year career that included 20 books such as "A Seal Called Andre," and hundreds of magazine articles. Dietz, who died Sunday at age 90, wrote about what he knew best, the people of Maine and their lives, the outdoors and adventurous treks into the wilderness. "Lew [Dietz] is what I would call a real Maine writer," said longtime friend and writer Jane Day. "He wrote about the thing rolling around him, and that was Maine," she said, drawing his characters from the state's rivermen, hunters, wardens and guides.

Full text:   Prolific author Lew Dietz once told a friend he had a small talent that he parlayed into a career.
That remark captured Dietz's modesty, despite a 60-year career that included 20 books such as "A Seal Called Andre," and hundreds of magazine articles.
Dietz, who died Sunday at age 90, wrote about what he knew best, the people of Maine and their lives, the outdoors and adventurous treks into the wilderness.
Dietz's best-known book was "A Seal Called Andre," co-authored by a friend, Harry Goodridge.
First published in 1975, "A Seal Called Andre" is the story of an orphaned seal pup that was raised by Rockport's harbormaster, Harry Goodridge, to become perhaps the most famous performing seal in history.
For more than 15 years, summer visitors and locals alike flocked to Rockport harbor to witness Andre's daily performances. Although Andre died some years ago, the book is still in print, has been translated into Japanese and was made into a successful Hollywood movie.
"Lew is what I would call a real Maine writer," said longtime friend and writer Jane Day. "He wrote about the thing rolling around him, and that was Maine," she said, drawing his characters from the state's rivermen, hunters, wardens and guides.
"When he wrote, it was for real. You knew you were there," Day said.
Longtime friend James Rockefeller spoke similarly.
"He really, really loved the out-of-doors," and this love inspired many of his tales, especially the Jeff White series, Rockefeller said.
That series of five books, written for boys, focused on woodsy themes such as hunting, trapping and guiding, all with an emphasis on adventure and conservation.
"Jeff White had a great effect on the youth in Maine for many, many years," Rockefeller said.
Longtime friend John G. Sinclair, who spent many hours in the backwoods with Dietz, recalled one fish story in particular.
"Lew came with me one time when I was canoeing down Beaver Brook into the Aroostook River. Water was low and it was a long hard trip. Just before entering the river, a splashing back of a gravel bar attracted us," he said.
"It was a very large trout a little landlocked. Quickly we slid a paddle under it and got it in the canoe. Lew took the beautiful fish back to Rockport and I don't think he mentioned how the catch was made."
Dietz was born in Pittsburgh on May 22, 1906, and grew up in Westfield, N.J.
After studying journalism at New York University, he traveled to Paris, where he remained for six months before a shortage of money prompted him to return to New York. There he took a job with an advertising agency.
In 1932, during the Great Depression, Dietz left his job as a copy writer and moved to Boothbay Harbor to begin a career as a free-lance writer.
He married his first wife, Margaret Hawkey, in BoothbayHarbor. By 1942, the couple moved to the Camden-Rockport area, where Dietz took a wartime job managing the stockroom at the Camden Shipyard when the yard was turning out wooden-hulled minesweepers.
By the end of the war, Dietz began writing hunting and fishing stories for "Field and Stream" and other publications.
It was in the late 1940s that Dietz conceived the series of boys' books featuring the character Jeff White. The series was later published in the early 1950s by Little, Brown and Company, beginning with "Jeff White, Young Woodsman."
Dietz wrote half a dozen other fiction titles for Little Brown through the 1960s. He also authored "The Allagash" in the Rivers of America series for Holt, Rinehart and Winston and "A Touch of Wilderness."
In 1977, Doubleday published Dietz's favorite work, "Night Train at Wiscasset Station." The book, which includes photographs by Kosti Ruohomaa of Rockland, a close friend and collaborator on many magazine assignments, is considered a Maine classic.
A founding contributor to "Down East" magazine, Dietz contributed scores of articles, primarily on outdoor themes, beginning in 1954. His last contribution was a fiction piece published in 1988. Other magazines for which he wrote included "True," "Yankee," "Geo" and "Redbook." His work also has been included in a number of anthologies.
After his first marriage ended in divorce, Dietz married painter Denny Winters in 1950. The couple went on to establish an informal artistic salon in the big white house on Rockport harbor where Dietz lived for more than half a century.
Winters was a founder of Maine Coast Artists and her husband played a critical role in obtaining Rockport's old firehouse for use as a gallery for a nominal sum. The gallery continues operating today.
Dietz served for six years on the Maine Commission on the Arts and Humanities. He was also chairman of the Rockport Conservation Commission and was instrumental in efforts to preserve the nearby Oyster River Bog.
A Democrat in politics, which was a rarity in Rockport at the time, Dietz served on the county and state Democratic committees and was a delegate to the bitterly divided Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, where he took a strong stand against the Vietnam War.
His wife, Denny Winters, died in 1985. There are no survivors. A memorial service will be held in the summer.

Abstract: A New England Fish Tale, Seafood Recipes and Observations of a Way of Life from a Fisherman's Wife," is the rather long-winded title of a new cookbook, fresh off the press. It was written by Martha Watson Murphy who views the scene from the Rhode Island coast, specifically the port of Galilee in Narragansett Bay. It is a book of museum quality, filled with fascinating photographsof fishing boats and gear, fishermen in authentic rather than the newer synthetic oilskins, with a text scattered with bits of wisdom and explanation about the life and independence of the fishing industry. A common expression among fishermen: "The worst day fishing still beats the best day working." If there is an old salt in your family, as there is in mine, you may have trouble keeping the book in your kitchen.

It would be reasonable to expect that a book of old pictures gleaned from the Mystic Seaport Museum, the Cape Ann Historical Society, and other private sources . . . . together with stories about fishing before technology caught up with it, might be accompanied by old recipes to match. Not so. Fishing has changed; tastes have changed. These recipes are just as innovative as any I have seen from the Pacific rim.
For example, who would have thought that smoked mackerel, combined with caramelized apples would make an appetizer when placed on a small Rhode Island johnnycake? Has anyonetried oysters with onion on a pizza, with Gorgonzola and Asiago cheese? Black Bean nachos with Lobster Salsa? From Wolfgang Puck? No . . . It's Martha Watson Murphy.
"A New England Fish Tale" is, naturally enough, about the fish that are brought in to Narragansett Bay - this means striped bass, squid, tautog, skate and monkfish - but there are enough recipes and ideas to keep us busy in the kitchen for some time to come, no matter what the availability might be in our particular area. And if we should ever need directions on how to clean squid, well, it's on page 25.
I have tried two of the recipes so far, with great results. The first is for the familiar fish chowder. This one has no salt pork in it (great news for many) and needs almost no simmering or tending. Best of all, you can make it early, put it in the oven for an hour and finish it just before serving time.
Oven-Baked Fish Chowder
2 pounds cod, haddock, hake or any firm white fish
3 cups diced potatoes
1 1/2 cups diced celery
1 1/2 cups diced onion
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt
4 whole cloves
4 tablespoons butter
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 cups boiling water or fish stock
1 clove garlic, finely minced
1 cup milk or light cream (*)
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Remove bones from the fish fillets. Place the fillets whole in a 4-quart Dutch oven or other ovenproof casserole that can be transferred later to the top of the stove. Do not cut up the fillets. Add the vegetables and all the remaining ingredients (except the milk or cream and parsley.) Cover the casserole and bake for 1 hour.
Transfer the casserole to the top of the stove and place over low heat. Slowly stir in the milk or cream. (* I used considerably more than 1 cup, but the consistency is up to the cook!) Let sit over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes. Add the fresh parsley and serve immediately. Serves 6.
THIS RECIPE was developed for Maine shrimp. It was interesting to note that the author preferred them to small or medium Gulf shrimp, and complained that they were "not always available fresh" in her area.
The first part of this recipe is reminiscent of the Italian way of sauteing finely chopped vegetables very gently in butter before stirring in the flour that makes the sauce. If this were a sofritto, some salt might be added to the onion to keep it from cooking too quickly.
This is a delightful dish, and of course you can use any kind of pasta you prefer. As you can see, Angel Hair is the author's choice; if your appetite is less delicate, spaghetti works well too.
Angel Hair Pasta with Shrimp, Peas and Dill
3 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup finely diced onion
1/2 cup finely diced carrot
2 tablespoons flour
2 1/4 cups milk
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill
1 1/2 pounds fresh shrimp, uncooked and cleaned
1 1/2 cups peas
1 pound pasta
salt and pepper to taste
In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Cook the onion and carrot until tender. Sprinkle in the flour and stir until it is incorporated. Add the milk slowly, stirring constantly and allowing the sauce to thicken after each addition, until all the milk is added and the sauce is thick. Add the wine and continue cooking to thicken again.
Add the herbs, shrimp, peas, salt and pepper. Stir gently and keep on the lowest heat for about 10 minutes.
In the meantime, add the pasta to a pot of boiling water. When the pasta is cooked al dente, drain and transfer it to a side, shallow bow. Top with the shrimp sauce, toss and serve immediately. Serves 4.

This spring, biologists will test bacteria that could replace a controversial pesticide used to kill the caterpillars that have caused rashes and respiratory problems on the islands of Casco Bay.
If the tests are successful, the bacteria could render Dimilin obsolete in time for next year's spraying for browntail moth caterpillars, state and federal researchers say.
The discovery is good news for residents on Portland's Casco Bay islands, where the city plans to spray Dimilin in May for the third year in a row.
Since the caterpillars appeared in Maine in 1989, many islanders, particularly on Peaks Island, have opposed the use of Dimilin. The pesticide can harm lobsters and other shellfish, and its long-term effects on human health and the environment are unknown.
Yet the caterpillars themselves have become something of a health risk to islanders. Their tiny hairs, which become airborne and land on people, cause a severe, itchy rash that persists for days. The hairs also can cause breathing problems when inhaled.
The benefit of a bacterial agent is that it is engineered to kill a particular insect and pose no risk to humans, the environment, aquatic life or even other insects.
The agent to be used against the browntail moth was discovered this winter by Normand Dubois, a U.S. Forest Service microbiologist, and researchers at the Northeastern Center for Forest Health in Hamden, Conn.
It is a combination of two strains of an established bacterial insecticide called Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt. There are 40,000 strains of Bt, some better than others against specific insects.
Dubois said the agent has been proven in lab tests to kill the browntail moth caterpillar. When a caterpillar eats it, the Bt mixes with certain cells on the caterpillar's stomach wall, seeps into its blood and kills it.
"Unlike a lot of chemicals, where you spray and see the insect drop, it takes two or three days for the insect to die with Bt," Dubois said.
The next step is to test the pesticide's effectiveness in the field.
The testing will begin in late May, when the caterpillars are actively feeding on the foliage. It will probably be done somewhere on Peaks Island, said Richard Bradbury, a Maine Forest Service entomologist who will do the testing along with Dubois and Jeff Tarling, Portland's arborist.
The Bt will be applied from the ground, not sprayed from an airplane.
The trick, Dubois said, will be to find the right mixture of Bt. Browntails, he said, are very sensitive and won't eat the foliage if they suspect something is wrong.
The tests also will determine the best way to use the Bt in aerial spraying. The right mixture is especially important for aerial spraying, because heavy coastal winds and sunlight could render the Bt ineffective within 30 hours after it's sprayed.
Because of the testing still needed, it's unlikely that the Bt will be available in timefor this year's spraying season, Dubois said.
"What we want to do is prove that it will work in nature as well as it works in the lab," he said. "That's why we have to go with the ground application this year."
The caterpillars emerge from their webs in early May, feed voraciously and grow to 1 1/2 inches long before becoming moths in the summer.
Portland is now preparing to spray Dimilin on Little Diamond Island, Cushing's Island and infested parts of Peaks Island. The aerial spraying is planned for the third week of May, weather permitting, Tarling said.
Tarling said he expects almost all of Little Diamond and Cushing's to be sprayed with Dimilin. How much of Peaks Island will be sprayed remains in question because of opposition to the pesticide.
Because of the opposition last year, the city sprayed only the southwest corner of the island, known as Torrington Point.
Claire Filliettaz, who supports aerial spraying, said the Dimilin cut down on caterpillar hairs last summer and appears to have reduced the number of new webs this year.
"I've got to say there's been an improvement," she said. "People were envious of Torrington Point last year, that's for sure."
Others islanders, like Ellen Tripp of Willow Avenue, say they will continue to oppose the use of Dimilin.
"I would rather take my chances of scratching this year than have Dimilin on my property affect us and our animals," Tripp said. "We try to keep our property as ecologi cally sound as possible."
Tripp said she plans to spray the caterpillars with a mixture of detergent and water if they infest the lower foliage on her property.
For now, Tarling said, he is trying to map out areas of Peaks for the crop-duster to spray. State law requires the city to have written permission from property owners before spraying.
Tarling said he sent 1,000 notices to Peaks property owners requesting permission to spray on their property. As of last week, about half had returned the cards saying they would approve spraying.
"It has definitely been an emotional issue for people on the islands," Tarling said. "But we've had even more people pretty emotional about getting the rash."
People on both sides of the debate say they're anxious to see Dimilin's use discontinued.
"It would be a desirable turn if we could get the Bt to work," Bradbury said. "We could spray it right up to the water's edge and it wouldn't hurt shellfish. It's just a logistical nightmare trying to get permission to treat an area with Dimilin." -------------------------------------------------------------------- --------- FOR LINKS to Internet information on the browntail moth, see the Press Herald's World Wide Web site: www.portland.com

CLAMMERS DIG IT: FLATS REOPENED AFTER 10 YEARS, OGUNQUIT RESIDENTS FINALLY GET A CHANCE TO DIG FOR CLAMS.

Abstract: For the first time in a decade, recreational clam diggers spent the weekend digging until their muscles ached, enjoying an end-of-winter rite that had been forbidden. Pollution in the flats prevented clam digging for 10 years on four acres of tidal flats at the mouth of the Ogunquit River. But after tests showed the flats are now clean, the state Department of Marine Resources finally gave the go-ahead for weekend and holiday digging by residents. "For people who like to dig, it's been very frustrating, like not being able to pick berries or go trout fishing for 10 years," said Isabel Lewando, a member of the Ogunquit Shellfish Conservation Commission.

Full text:   For the first time in a decade, recreational clam diggers spent the weekend digging until their muscles ached, enjoying an end-of-winter rite that had been forbidden.
"It was great to see a thing of the past coming back," said Martin Damren, 54, whose family was among 40 locals who bought $10 licenses allowing them to dig for dinner.
"It's very nostalgic," said 65-year-old Charles Turnbull. "I can remember doing this as a boy." His wife, Norma, made fritters with the clams he unearthed Saturday.
Pollution in the flats prevented clam digging for 10 years on four acres of tidal flats at the mouth of the Ogunquit River. But after tests showed the flats are now clean, the state Department of Marine Resources finally gave the go-ahead for weekend and holiday digging by residents.
"For people who like to dig, it's been very frustrating, like not being able to pick berries or go trout fishing for 10 years," said Isabel Lewando, a member of the Ogunquit Shellfish Conservation Commission.
The local flats, like thousands of acres of clam flats along Maine's coast, became polluted by sewage that was the result of increased development.
In Ogunquit this winter, the frustration of recreational diggers grew to anger when the flats were opened exclusively to an out-of-town shellfish company, Spinney Creek Shellfish.
TheEliot company is the only one in Maine with the technology to clean clams harvested from polluted flats.
Local officials and residents, who had been itching to dig a peck, viewed the decision to open the flats to a commercial dig as a slap in the face.
"We thought it was very unfair," said John Miller, chairman of the board of selectmen.
Now the residents are getting their turn.
Last Friday at town hall, 40 resident and 10 non-resident digging licenses were quickly sold. The permits alloweach person to dig up to a peck a day on weekends and holidays, from Sept. 15 to May 15. License holders have three more weekends of digging before they reluctantly must hang up their rakes until the fall.
Lewando, who was active in working with state marine officials to get the flats reopened, said she was afraid there wouldn't be any clams left as a result of the commercial digging. But her fears were unfounded.
"It went very well," said Lewando, who rescued baby clams during the commercial digging and replanted them in less productive areas. "There is still a good clam population."
Illustration PHOTO: color; Caption: Staff photo by Gregory Rec Isabel Lewando was key in opening up the Ogunquit clam flats to recreational clamming. This weekend, residents with licenses went clamming on the flats for the first time in 10 years. Of plowing through the bureaucratic red tape, Lewando said, ``It was easy, anybody could do it.''

In East Norwich, he was active in the local volunteer fire department, and was a founder of the East Norwich Fishing Club. He was a member of St. Dominic's Roman Catholic Church in Oyster Bay.
His wife died in 1988.
He is survived by two sons, John of West Newfield and W. Michael of Eastport, N.Y.; and four grandchildren, Jacob, Sally, Quinn and Casey.
Private funeral services have already been held. A memorial service will be held this summer at the family burial plot in Brooklyn, N.Y. Arrangements are by the Heald Funeral Home.

Full text:   Lyn Liljeholm is a free-lance writer who lives in Portland.
". . . the choice of restaurants is ample: For top-dollar excellence, La Belle Otero (Cannes) . . . two stars in the Michelin ...dinner for two with wine in the $250 to $300 range . . ."
Not the kind of incidental information you want when you are heading for the Riviera and look at $200 or $300 as a comfortable cushion to supplement your plastic, your ATM and, since I was going to a food-writers' convention outside Nice, with some splendid meals to come.
I was pretty sure, though, that despite the chilling effect of the cost of dining out on the Cote d'Azur, I could scrounge through six days in Nice on my thin folder of travelers checks. After that, I would hit the Michelin circuit.
Five days later I was doing my own version of Cheap Eats, Riviera-style. I was in a little cafe on the Promenade des Anglais, the Gold Coast of Nice, having a mushroom omelet, pommes frites, a salad and yogurt for a total tab of 380 francs - under $10. So much for this expert, La Belle Otero, and haute cuisine.
I was juggling a three-way schedule when I flew into Nice in October. First, I was meeting a friend who was at the tail end of a two-week dash across Provence with her Montclair, N.J., church group.
Item No. 2: I was interviewing the general manager of the world-famous Negresco, for a hoteliers' newsletter. That meant a move across town from my friend's hotel to be on the boulevard, within walking distance of the Negresco. The last four days meant another move out to St. Jean-Cap Ferrat, where my convention was to meet.
This shifting around meant three hotels (four eventually), and even with three booked, there was a glitch: My travel agent's print-out showed a "missing" night. (I was pretty cavalier about that while still in Portland; if the Holiday Inn could put me up for two nights, what was the problem with the third?)
The weather was perfect when we taxied in at Nice airport. The city itself looked like a Belle Epoque version of Los Angeles, except that all the palms were tall and stately. I'd just gotten settled at the Holiday Inn when my friend, Jeannie, on Day 12 of hurtling across Provence, appeared at my door, announcing breathlessly, "I'm bushed!"
I admitted that I was jet-lagged out of my mind: At that point, I'd gone through five airports in 24 hours: Portland, Boston, JFK, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Nice. But the Christ Church group members were, undaunted, heading out for Monaco the next day. Because one of their members had broken a wrist and dropped out of the excursion, I was willingly coopted to take her place.
Monaco is about 15 miles out of Nice, reached by any one of three corniches, or mountain-clinging highways: an upper, a middle and a lower. If you ever saw Cary Grant in "To Catch a Thief" on the late show, you will know how vertiginous these roads are. Monte Carlo is the casino-and-castle section of tiny, mile-square Monaco, and the part that's high above the Mediterranean is called The Rock. With good reason.
It is a rock. We got from Vielle Ville to the upper level by a series of elevators and escalators jam-packed with tourists. And thiswas autumn.
Monte Carlo is eminently walkable. We threaded our way through cobbled medieval streets and alleys, emerging on the grand square where the rococo casino stands. We didn't gamble; we just gaped at the Lamborghenis and Ferraris parked outside.
A peek inside revealed red-velvet furnishings, gilt ceilings, Baccarat chandeliers and a marble corridor bracketed by onyx columns. This led back to the Opera House, where Nijinsky and Sarah Bernhardt once performed.
After the splendors of the casino, Prince Rainier's palace was a modest affair: a chunky beige fortress with crenellated towers, with two sentries like toy soldiers on duty, and two cannons at either end of a cobblestoned square.
Our big thrill at the palace was sighting a friend of Prince Albert. He was stepping out of his limousine (one ofthe caribinieri alerted us). The Friend of P.A., unlike the commonality, was allowed to drive into the sacred precincts. Actually, there are few cars on The Rock. No room. This accounted for the constant whirring of chopper blades overhead as hotel guests and high rollers were ferried in from the Nice airport.
It was back to the States the next day for my friend Jeannie, her church group. Even as they left, another tour group surged into the Holiday Inn lobby, slumping against the registration desk or sitting dispiritedly beside their suitcases with the unmistakable look of people who have just crossed five time zones. My moment of truth had arrived: no room at the inn.
It seems that Niceis that hotel manager's dream city: over 90 percent occupancy nearly year-round.
However, a call was made from the desk and a room found for me at the Carlton, just half a block away, plus a porter to take my suitcase. Despite its English-sounding name, the Carlton was utterly French. My room key was anchored to a ball; none of this business of a high-tech plastic "key" that winks you into your room. The room itself had a bed with a bolster and a bath with a bidet. My tiny balcony with its wrought-iron railing overlooked linden-lined Rue V. Hugo.
My next hotel, the West End, on the Promenade des Anglaid, was one of the huge, Edwardian wedding-cake hotels that line the boulevard. As a single, I got a room the size of a shoebox. If you travel solo, your room is always either a shoebox or a normal-sized room for which you pay two-thirds of the amount charged for the more desirable pair.
Checking and converting my receipts, I found my rooms so far had been in the $115-a-night range, and not making huge inroads on my plastic. My travelers' checks had not diminished noticeably and, to keep costs down, I now began to think of lunch in terms of le piquenique.
My little room, at the back of the hotel, overlooked an appealing park with royal palms soaring up to improbable heights. Best of all, for le piquenique there were inviting benches and wicker trash baskets. To find the park, I had to go down to ground level and circuit the hotel, which took up half a city block. It fronted the promenade, eight lanes wide, with (on the Mediterranean side) a shingle beach and boardwalks. A virtual Grand Prix course ran along the boulevard, with nonstop traffic roaring through en route to all the Riviera towns that dot the coast: Jean les Pins, Cannes, Antibes, St.Tropez.
Cars weren't having any more luck on the back streets, I saw as I walked down the Rue Meyerbeer. They were parked nose-to-grille, and on a lamp post was a cartoon sign graphically depicting tow-away, with a truck and crane lifting a small car. My problem wasn't that of the hapless Riviera driver, but reciting the magic words epicier, alimenta
tion, comestibles.
I didn't find the charcuterie right away, but along the Avenue France, among the dress shops, real estate agents, hair salons and butcher shops.
I found the China Park, where I had dinner later: chicken with mushrooms and a huge pot of tea, 57 francs with tip, or $16. Chinese restaurants, anywhere, are always a good bet if you're stretching travel dollars, and this was a far cry from a $300 dinner.
I found a place for carry-out lunch and assembled baguette, cheese, pates and fruit for about $8. The park I'd spotted from my third-floor room turned out to be not a park at all, but the grounds of the Massena Museum, which features pieces from Nice's 4,000-year history, including Napoleonic mementoes.
I went through a back gate into the grounds, claimed a bench and had le picquenique undisturbed except for sedate French matrons walking their dogs. France must be dog heaven. Dogs were in restaurants, in souvenir shops and, of course, in parks. In a listing of hotels from the tourist office, I found that dogs are accepted in 80 percent of all local hotels.
The taxi out to Cap Ferrat took the biggest bite yet out of my travelers' checks: $40, but it was the last check I had to cash in. The distance was approximately that from Monument Square in Portland to the outer reaches of Cape Elizabeth.
Cap Ferrat is basically a suburb of Nice, with a harbor tucked between it and the Bayof Angels. Here there were yacht jams as well as car jams. The Riviera is a magnet for anyone who owns a yacht. We saw a Niarchos yacht in port, among a thicket of spars of lesser yachts, sailboats, plus workaday fishing boats. The ferry to Corsica had its dock in the bay.
St. Jean-Cap Ferrat was a kind of Beverly Hills with pedestrians. Luxurious villas hid behind stone pillars and wrought-iron gates. Buried in bougainvillea and mimosa issome of the most expensive real estate in the world. In Beverly Hills you can attract the attention of police as a walker; here, typically European, there was a hiker's path all the way to the end of the cape.
Because the convention crowd was housed in two hotels in adjacent towns, we walked from Beaulieu, which merged into St. Jean, along the Promenade M. Bouvier, following a curve in the bay to the lavish ballrooms of the Royal Riviera. A dozen Provencal chefs busied themselves in booths around the ballroom, serving up oysters, homards (their version of lobster), other things sizzling in wine sauce, truffles en pate and what the more knowledgeable food writers called beau braise barbe de capucin. Or they pointed at a booth and urged, "Try that one!'
' The buzz was that we were going back into the hinterlands, to the vineyards of the Domaine Ott the next day, and the day after to Moulin des Mougins, on one of the hilltop towns, a restaurant that gets a mention in every upscale guidebook in France.
We ended our circuit of the ballroom, replete, at a long dessert bar where a huge ice sculpture of a swan slowly melted as the chefs flambeed their crepes in cointreau. The French take their food seriously, as we know. Those guys in the funny white hats were not short-order cooks.
It was rumored among the food columnists on hand that top Parisian chefs pulls down $100,000 a year. That brought to mind the $300 meal. We had translators at the ready, so I could quiz one of the dozen chefs presiding over the grills, rotisseries and fondue flames: "Is it possible a dinner for two could cost 1,500 francs ($300) on the Cote d'Azur?"
"Mille francs plus? Avec vin?" he ruminmated. Then a big smile: "Bein sur!"

[Martin] Brodeur became the fourth goalie in NHL history to score - and only the second in a playoff game - when he lofted the puck from the right side of his crease, across the length of the ice and into the empty Montreal Canadiens' net at the end of a 5-2 win Thursday in the opening game of the Eastern Conference playoffs. "I was freaking out. It was unbelievable," Brodeur said. "When I shot it, it went over everyone and I kind of lost it. I saw John MacLean raise his arms up. I said: `Wow, it's got to go in if he's doing that.' Guys in front of me went to the side and I saw it go in. I'll never forget that moment."

Full text: Being a goalie in the NHL is sometimes like being the drummer in a band. Apart from the occasional solo, you're mostly in the background while the other guys show off.
Forgive this season's playoff goaltenders if they step to the front of the stage. And leading the dance is Martin Brodeur of New Jersey.
Brodeur became the fourth goalie in NHL history to score - and only the second in a playoff game - when he lofted the puck from the right side of his crease, across the length of the ice and into the empty Montreal Canadiens' net at the end of a 5-2 win Thursday in the opening game of the Eastern Conference playoffs.
"I was freaking out. It was unbelievable," Brodeur said. "When I shot it, it went over everyone and I kind of lost it. I saw John MacLean raise his arms up. I said: `Wow, it's got to go in if he's doing that.' Guys in front of me went to the side and I saw it go in. I'll never forget that moment."
Philadelphia's Ron Hextall was the first goalie to score in the playoffs in 1989. He also scored once in the regular season, as did the New York Islanders' Billy Smith and Detroit's Chris Osgood.
Until Smith's unintentional goal (it bounced off somebody) in 1979, NHL goaltenders didn't think much about shooting. Opposing goalies leave their creases only occasionally for a fraction of game time and, even then, it's a hard shot to make.
How hard? Imagine using a scythe to swat a crushed soda can past 11 people at a love seat across a bumpy parking lot while wearing a catcher's mitt on one hand and a medium-sized phone book tied to the back of the other. That's how hard.
DETROIT COACH Scotty Bowman decided to keep his Red Wings under one roof during the playoffs. He checked them into a downtown hotel, figuring it would limit distractions and promote unity.
But the commute from the hotel to Joe Louis Arena is actually farther than it would be from center Kris Draper's residence. Draper lives in a condo complex next to the arena. Still, he thought it was a good move.
"It's nice to have the whole team there," Draper said. "There are no distractions, no matter what. You get to bed and don't have to worry about phone calls coming in or anything like that. You can just concentrate on hockey."
A TEAM new to the playoffs must develop traditions for its fans to join the celebration. Until some ideas strike, the Anaheim Mighty Ducks can borrow from their opponent.
The Ducks, starting their first-ever playoffs on home ice, were honored by noisy fans wearing white shirts and waving white towels. The sellout crowd got the jump on fans of the first-round foes, the Phoenix Coyotes, who donned white when the team was known as the Winnipeg Jets.
Whatever the tradition's origin, it made an immediate splash on the Ducks, who won 4-2.
"It's an incredible feeling to see all those people going crazy waving their towels," Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert said.
Coach Ron Wilson, joking about spotting a few "slackers" who were wearing black shirts, said, "I wanted to grab a white towel and wave it, too. It creates a mob environment and I wanted to be part of it."
IT DOESN'T matter what you call it. No critters - except the two-legged, stick-wielding kind - are allowed on the ice.
Last year, when the Panthers made it to the Stanley Cup finals, enthusiastic Florida fans threw plastic rats on the ice whenever their team scored. Goalies had to take refuge in their nets during delays while officials cleared the ice.
In Detroit, the tradition has been to throw octopuses. The tradition dates to when the octopuses' eight legs symbolized the eight games needed to win the Cup.
The NHL decided enough was enough this year and banned any kind of object-tossing, except hats when a player scores three goals.
Research into the topic proved enlightening for some league officials, NHL senior vice president Brian Burke said in a telephone news conference.
"Anyone on this call besides me realize that an octopus is a mollusk?" he asked. "I looked that up last year."

Abstract: Our recentmeal at David's, though, was as pleasurable and as carefully conceptualized as one of Mozart's concertos. Our desserts were a true crescendo, following a meal that had an adagio tempo in which eating and conversation flowed easily in a fluid manner. We dinedin the upstairs section of David's known as the Oyster Club, which offers more of a bistro setting than the formal dining downstairs. Oysters are featured in various ways on the menu, either on the half shell (market price) or in dishes such as baked oysters with spinach and sundried tomatoes ($6.50). We also shared an order of bruschetta ($3.95), a large piece of Italian bread brushed with olive oil and garlic, then layered with sliced tomatoes and capped with mozzarella. The bruschetta was enjoyable, but I have had other versionsin which tomato, garlic and fresh basil is emphasized as the topping, perhaps with a sprinkling of fresh parmesan or asiago cheese. This version, however, emphasized the cheese, and there was certainly a lot of it. The appetizer was filling, even divided by five people.

Full text: J.M. Falla is a free-lance writer who lives in midcoast Maine. Falla dines anonymously. Restaurants are visited once, with a second visit when necessary. The Telegram pays for the meals.
Every meal has a natural rhythm, a clear beginning and ending with the middle being an adventure in improvisation, somewhat like a jazz tune.
Our recentmeal at David's, though, was as pleasurable and as carefully conceptualized as one of Mozart's concertos. Our desserts were a true crescendo, following a meal that had an adagio tempo in which eating and conversation flowed easily in a fluid manner.
This steady pace of our dinner was somewhat of a surprise to the group with whom I dined - a fairly unruly team of five out to enjoy a night on the town. True, when you're among the company of people you enjoy, you tend perhaps to be less critical ofa restaurant because you're laughing too much to scrutinize.
Our meals, however, could not go unnoticed, nor could our server's disposition. Our boisterous behavior was blessed by a kind waitress with a good sense of humor - two qualities that are a breath of fresh air in any person involved in providing a service.
Although our server did seem to skip a couple of beats - a few times she was preoccupied and distracted - her sincerity compensated for her somewhat erratic attention spans.
We dinedin the upstairs section of David's known as the Oyster Club, which offers more of a bistro setting than the formal dining downstairs. Oysters are featured in various ways on the menu, either on the half shell (market price) or in dishes such as baked oysters with spinach and sundried tomatoes ($6.50).
The menus on each floor are different, with the downstairs providing a more upscale culinary genre. However, the upstairs was perfect for our group. It is more casual, with a diverse offering of affordable pasta and seafood dishes, as well as a few sandwich selections and a couple of pizzas.
The upstairs decor at David's is nothing fancy, just a typical grouping of tables with a bar set off to the back with plants that divide the tables and the bar. Nothing struck me as remarkable about the setting, which is why the exceptional presentation of the entrees came as a surprise.
I had heard David's food was good - not from Portland people but from friends in Boston who have come to Portland specificallyto eat there.
The appetizers gave us the first glimpse of the chef's creativity. We ordered lobster cakes ($6.25), a pair of delicately breaded cakes with a mildly seasoned lobster stuffing, set symmetrically on a large white plate and drizzled with a marinara sauce.
We also shared an order of bruschetta ($3.95), a large piece of Italian bread brushed with olive oil and garlic, then layered with sliced tomatoes and capped with mozzarella. The bruschetta was enjoyable, but I have had other versionsin which tomato, garlic and fresh basil is emphasized as the topping, perhaps with a sprinkling of fresh parmesan or asiago cheese. This version, however, emphasized the cheese, and there was certainly a lot of it. The appetizer was filling, even divided by five people.
David's showcases pasta with pizzazz as well as fresh seafood that diners can order baked, broiled or boiled. The seafood can be prepared in eight different ways, allowing the diner to pick a favorite such as Cajun seasoning, or a creamsauce with a hint of sherry or wild mushroom, or a simply pleasing lemon butter with herbs.
The pricing is equally flexible for the menu's 13 entrees - several of them can be ordered in full or half portions, with prices ranging from $6.95 for a half portion to $17.95 for a full portion.
The full portions are accompanied with an ample house salad. The half portions are sufficient for a meal, while the full portions are perfect for someone with a hearty appetite or for a dinner and a take-home lunch.
The sauces on each of our dishes were flavorful and well-balanced. I ordered penne pasta tossed with chicken, wild mushrooms and snow peas ($6.95), melded with a subtle herbed chicken broth in which I detected a splash of marsala. (The server wouldn't divulge the chef's secret.) The combination was delicious. My only complaint was that the meat used was not breast meat, and some of the chicken pieces contained tendons and veins.
The lobster ravioli ($7.25) and four-cheese ravioli ($10.95), like the penne, included pasta that was firm and not overcooked, each dish offering a respectable portion with a sauce that enhanced rather than disguised.
One friend ordered baked haddock ($7.25 for a half-portion), which was dressed with a wonderfully seasoned wild mushroom cream sauce. The fish came with simple crisp green beans and rice pilaf.
A chicken sandwich ($5.50) pleased the youngest of our dining group and received good reviews.
There were kudos all around for the desserts, with a special hats-off for the bread pudding ($3.95), a stick-to-your-ribs sweet blend of bread soaked in egg and crisped to a scrumptious crunch.
The desserts were beautifully presented. We tried a meringue ($3.50) - a nest of spun sugar that looked like something out of a fairy tale, drizzled in a lemon sauce. There was also a rich piece of chocolate torte ($4.95), a decadent indulgence worth working off later at the gym.
Having played in a band, I am always amazed and appreciative of how the various instrumentscombine in what seems like very separate pieces of music to ultimately harmonize into one cohesive melody. This is like a good meal to me - there is always the touch of a miracle that everything arrives at once to meld into one enjoyable evening.
When a dining experience is right, you just know it. The meal is orchestrated like a symphony, each fork held like the bows to violins, hitting the strings in a remarkable synchronism.
The meal for five came to $67.50 (without wine and tip). That was musicto our ears and definitely a grand finale to applaud.

Abstract: Except for the shark (which is even older), the sturgeon had few enemies, says Thomas S. Squiers Jr., a state marine resources scientist - at least until modern humans began to develop, a paltry 2 million years ago. Of the 23 species of sturgeon worldwide, only two inhabit Maine waters - the shortnose and the Atlantic sturgeon, both of which are off-limits to fishermen. It's illegal to take or possess any sturgeon in Maine or most of the eastern seaboard. "One of the first fisheries in the state of Maine was at Brunswick at the falls," Squiers says. "They were catching Atlantic sturgeon and Atlantic salmon back in 1624."

Full text:   During the next few weeks, a fish unchanged for about 50 million years will move virtually unnoticed through the Kennebec River system, spawning a new generation of one of the world's most primitive fish.
The sturgeon swam into its ecological niche just about the time the last dinosaur vanished. Since then, many other species have come and gone. But the sturgeon, from its primitive bony plates to its tubelike toothless mouth, apparently didn't need to change to survive.
Except for the shark (which is even older), the sturgeon had few enemies, says Thomas S. Squiers Jr., a state marine resources scientist - at least until modern humans began to develop, a paltry 2 million years ago.
"Sturgeon are a pretty hardy species," Squiers says, "although its habitat is fairly unique and it's being impacted by man more than it probably has been impacted in years."
Of the 23 species of sturgeon worldwide, only two inhabit Maine waters - the shortnose and the Atlantic sturgeon, both of which are off-limits to fishermen. It's illegal to take or possess any sturgeon in Maine or most of the eastern seaboard.
Although the two species look similar, the shortnose grows to only about 4 feet, while the Atlantic may reach more than 12 feet and 600 pounds, Squiers says.
Once, both species thrived in great numbers along Maine's coast and in its tidal rivers. Explorers in the early 1600s reportedly saw sturgeon longer than men. Sometimes, the great fish would upset canoes when they were being speared.
"One of the first fisheries in the state of Maine was at Brunswick at the falls," Squiers says. "They were catching Atlantic sturgeon and Atlantic salmon back in 1624."
In the days when sturgeon were very common, their roe - caviar - was given away in saloons to attract customers. Sturgeon also were prized for their smoked meat, oil and air bladders, which are used to make isinglass, a gelatinous substance used as a clarifying agent and in jellies and glue.
But dams - which reduce spawning and nursery habitat - pollution, and overfishing diminished sturgeon populations along the East Coast.
Sturgeon are a long-lived fish, some reportedly surviving more than a century. But females don't mature and spawn until they're about 20 years old. So when fishing pressure was extensive, most of the fish large enough to spawn were caught. Then it would take decades for the population to recover.
"We can see from the historical notes that those fisheries occurred every 20 to 30 years and then they would collapse," Squiers says.
Federal protection and a significant reduction in pollution have helped the shortnose, which was on the original endangered species list of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 30 years ago, rebound in Maine.
When shortnose sturgeon were found in Montsweag Bay in 1971 and 1972, it was the first reported occurrence of the species here for more than 100 years. Now the population of the Kennebec River estuarial complex, which also includes the Androscoggin and Sheepscot rivers, is estimated at more than 7,000 adult fish.
Sturgeon are classified as anadromous fish, meaning they live in saltwater yet spawn in fresh. But Maine's shortnose sturgeon seem to spend their entire lives in rivers.
"We've never had a tagged fish caught outside the mouth of the Kennebec," Squiers says.
He is now researching migration patterns to make sure the shortnose won't be hurt by two construction projects along the Kennebec River. The state Department of Transportation plans to replace the Carlton Bridge in Bath. Bath Iron Works is also planning an expansion.
Although the study won't be completed until this summer, it appears both projects can proceed without hurting the sturgeon, Squiers says. An earlier study had shown shortnose sturgeon spend summers in the nearby Sasanoa River feeding off mollusks and large crustaceans. But it wasn't clear where the fish spent winters.
So last fall, Squiers began a $30,000 study using sonic tags or transmitters implanted in 15 sturgeon to track their winter movements. He found that thousands of sturgeon are spending the winter near an island above Merrymeeting Bay. As of last week, they had not yet begun their spawning runs.
"They usually start moving when the water temperature hits about 8 degrees centigrade (46 degrees Fahrenheit)," he says. "Now it's only from 2 1/2 to 4 degrees (36 to 39 F)."
Spawning in the spring, from late April to early May, has given the shortnose an advantage over the Atlantic sturgeon, Squiers says. At that time of year, he says, water quality was usually good even during the decades when the Kennebec system was very polluted.
But the Atlantic spawns in mid-summer, Squiers says, when oxygen levels in the rivers were very low from the 1930s to the 1960s. Pollution also kept fishermen away from the rivers, so pressure on theshortnose the last half century has been almost nil.
In contrast, the Atlantic sturgeon, which is protected only by state laws, are at risk as they migrate up the eastern seaboard, Squiers says. Because of its delectable meat and prized caviar, a single adult Atlantic sturgeon may bring as much as $12,000. Gourmet food experts say the Atlantic sturgeon's black eggs make as fine a caviar as the famed European species.
Driving up prices is the crash of the population of Russian beluga (or huso) sturgeon, once abundant in the Danube, Volga and other large rivers emptying into the Black and Caspian seas. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Squiers says, there's been no money to operate hatcheries to stock the rivers.
"In reality, the Atlantic sturgeon is probably more threatened than the shortnose," Squiers says.
Maine adopted a minimum length limit of 72 inches in 1983, in order to allow females to grow large enough to spawn. Then in 1992, a statewide moratorium of taking or possessing any Atlantic sturgeon was enacted.
The biggest population of Atlantic sturgeon is in the Hudson River system, and "just recently that's been going downhill," Squiers says.
New York approved a moratorium last year, and New Jersey is expected to follow suit this year. In an emergency move in January, the Georgia Board of Natural Resources banned fishing for the Atlantic sturgeon, because numbers had plummeted so low.
"The shortnose sturgeon is, I think, pretty much on the road to recovery," Squiers says. "The Atlantic sturgeon has a long way to go."

Abstract: Perhaps most important to New England and the United States in general is the future of our domestic coastal marine aquaculture. Fortunately, up to now, it has developed more slowly here than in other countries, so we may be able to avoid others' mistakes - mistakes that have led to serious environmental and social problems. U.S. aquaculture has up until now been limited for various reasons - wild-caught fish and shellfish have dominated our domestic market; aquaculture technology is costly; the permit process is byzantine;federal support has been weak, and shoreline property owners generally oppose aquaculture development. Aquaculture facilities pollute offshore waters with fecal material and food wastes, use wild-caught fish to feed their farmed fish, spread disease to wild fish populations, and release farmed fish into the wild where they compete with, prey upon and interbreed with wild salmon with unpredictable consequences. The wild fishery is threatened.

Full text: ABOUT THE AUTHOR Boyce Thorne-Miller is senior scientist at SeaWeb, a marine conservation initiative of the PEW Charitable Trusts in Washington, D.C.
Last month 3,000 "water farmers," scientists, regulators, economists and environmentalists met in Seattle at the World Aquaculture Society's annual conference.
They discussed a number of critical issues facing commercial fish and shellfish growers, including new technology, economic competitiveness and environmental sensitivity.
Perhaps most important to New England and the United States in general is the future of our domestic coastal marine aquaculture. Fortunately, up to now, it has developed more slowly here than in other countries, so we may be able to avoid others' mistakes - mistakes that have led to serious environmental and social problems.
U.S. aquaculture has up until now been limited for various reasons - wild-caught fish and shellfish have dominated our domestic market; aquaculture technology is costly; the permit process is byzantine;federal support has been weak, and shoreline property owners generally oppose aquaculture development.
Many now believe aquaculture to be the solution to today's overfishing crisis. It is not, however, a panacea for collapsing coastal fisheries.
Canadian horror stories
Consider the horror stories. Salmon farming in Canada, especially British Columbia, has had disastrous consequences.
Aquaculture facilities pollute offshore waters with fecal material and food wastes, use wild-caught fish to feed their farmed fish, spread disease to wild fish populations, and release farmed fish into the wild where they compete with, prey upon and interbreed with wild salmon with unpredictable consequences. The wild fishery is threatened.
Likewise, shrimp farmers in Asia and Central and South America are destroying vast expanses of critical mangrove habitat, spreading disease throughout cultivated and wild shrimp populations, depleting wild populations by overharvesting wild post-larvae (baby shrimp) to use as seed in their shrimp farms, and depriving coastal peoples of traditional access to resources.
Once success is demonstrated and profits are made, there is typically a rush to establish numerous identical facilities in near proximity to each other. These "monoculture" practices deplete natural resources and exacerbate the spread of nutrient pollution and disease.
What does this all mean for New England? In response to the collapse of the cod fishery here, efforts to cultivate cod and to establish hatcheries for the enhancement of the wild stock have been renewed.
These should be monitored with a cautious eye on the impacts upon wild populations. Salmon enhancement programs in the Northwest are now thought to have given rise to as many problems as solutions.
But vigilance over disease and nutrient pollution is still essential, and it would be wise to restrict the number and size of salmon rearing facilities.
Proposals have been floated for expansive open ocean farms in federal waters a considerable distance offshore from Massachusetts. Such proposals present yet another array of issues to be solved, including interference with fisheries and maritime traffic and questions of private ownership of public waters and the dilemma of large ocean predators attracted to the sites.
Region could lead the way
Yet far from being an activity to avoid, coastal marine aquaculture offers an opportunity to integrate food production with coastal environmental conservation. It has great potentialif approached in a way that makes sense from both agricultural and ecological perspectives.
It is important that ocean farmers seek regional diversification and explore "polyculture" incorporating a variety of native plants and animals to provide profitable products, live feed and clean water. With an interest in numerous potential native aquaculture species - oysters, clams, mussels, seaweed, flounder, cod, sea urchins - New England could set an example.
In Maine, seaweed farms market nori and experimental studies are under way to assess the environmental advantages of growing the seaweed next to salmon culture to use the excess nutrients from the fish.
While some of the seaweed grown is native, the marketable species is non-native. Studies have demonstrated an inability of the seaweed to reproduce in cold Maine waters. If, in fact, there is no chance of the species becoming naturalized in Northeastern waters, such an import would be acceptable.
The coastal zone and the valuable resources and services it provides are critical to the people of this country. Coastal aquaculture should therefore be well integrated into healthy coastal ecosystems and should benefit local coastal communities. With appropriate zoning, regulations and incentives, we can develop a vibrant coastal aquaculture and protect the environment at the same time.

Abstract: Today, one town or group of towns from each of three geographic areas - midcoast, southwest and Down East - will hear whether they have been selected to receive a million free seed clams as part of a first-ever large-scale attempt to build up Maine clam flats. Twelve applicants are vying for the project, from Wells in York County to Edmunds and South Trescott in Washington County. Midcoast communities include Wiscasset, Waldoboro and the five-town shellfish coalition of Newcastle, Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, Edgecomb and Damariscotta. "We want to see if this is a viable way to sustain the fishery," said Brian Beal, shellfish biologist with the University of Maine at Machias and the Beals Island project. "We're looking at ways to help create a more sustainable fishery, rather than a boom-or-bust one."

Full text: Millions of tiny clams will soon be sprinkled across coastal mud flats, boosting the future of a shaken industry.
Today, one town or group of towns from each of three geographic areas - midcoast, southwest and Down East - will hear whether they have been selected to receive a million free seed clams as part of a first-ever large-scale attempt to build up Maine clam flats.
Twelve applicants are vying for the project, from Wells in York County to Edmunds and South Trescott in Washington County. Midcoast communities include Wiscasset, Waldoboro and the five-town shellfish coalition of Newcastle, Boothbay, Boothbay Harbor, Edgecomb and Damariscotta.
In the past 15 years the state's soft-shell clam landings dropped by 72 percent.
The unstable supply has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars from the Maine economy, according to Ken Vencile, outreach coordinator for the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery, which is sponsoring the project.
It has also contributed to the loss of some conventional clam markets, and prevented the expansion of new ones.
"We want to see if this is a viable way to sustain the fishery," said Brian Beal, shellfish biologist with the University of Maine at Machias and the Beals Island project. "We're looking at ways to help create a more sustainable fishery, rather than a boom-or-bust one."
For their part, the winning towns must agree to enforce their clamming ordinances and get area schools involved. They must also agree to provide volunteers willing to make a three-year commitment to monitor water quality, assess the growth and survival of the clams in the plots, and attend meetings to discuss the results.
Right now, heaps of the thumbnail-sized clams are growing in tanks at the Darling Marine Center in Walpole, awaiting distribution.
In June, they will be scattered over dozens of 14-by-32-foot plots covered with mesh fine enough to keep out birds and crabs. Within half an hour the clams will have settled down into the mud, where they will grow for the next three years until they reach 2 inches in diameter - legal harvest size.
The plots will be monitored monthly, but hatchery administrators are relying on local enforcement to keep people away from the closed areas. "We're hoping they will see the potential of this project and give it a chance to succeed," Vencile said.
Biologists will also be watching to see if the numbers of wild seed clams increase in the project areas.
"We've noticed that when we put netting down it seems to attract wild clam settlers," said Vencile.
In addition to the seeded clams, towns will monitor commercial-sized clams contained in cages until late summer when their market price usually doubles or triples.
"A bushel of clams in April is worth $40 to a digger. In August it can bring up to $100," said Beal.
Keeping human predators away from the impounded clams will be hard, Vencile conceded.
"It's going to be very tempting," he said. "No town warden is going to sleep by the plots. We have to rely on the honesty of the townspeople to make it work."
Although more clam flats have been opened in recent years - 10,000 acres in 1996 alone - clam landings Down East have declined 60 percent to 70 percent since 1982. Washington County has seen a 90 percent loss.
In Lincoln County, where the catch has tended to remain steady, clam landings dropped from 501,067 pounds in 1995 to 374,995 in 1996.
No one knows why this is happening. Beal and others theorize that a combination of unchecked harvesting pressures, and too few clams left on the flats to produce a critical mass of offspring, are to blame.
"Clams spew out eggs and sperm into the water, which requires them to be close to each other in order to reproduce," Beal said.
In Cumberland County, where 10 times more settling clam larvae have been found, each smaller than a grain of sand, there has been little to no decline in landings.
The Beals Island hatchery, located off Jonesport, is the world's only soft-shell clam hatchery. It was established in 1987 as a non-profit, public shellfish aquaculture facility, and is supported by a mix of federal, state, community, corporate and private trust funds.
The hatchery plans to seed another million clams in the same three areas in 1998. Then the flats will remain closed through 1999 until the wild and hatchery seeds have attained commercial size.
Other towns competing for the project are: Scarborough, Georgetown, the five Georges River communities of Thomaston, St. George, Port Clyde, Tenants Harbor and Warren, and Islesboro, Steuben, Harrington, and Pembroke. "We want to see if this is a viable way to sustain the fishery." Brian Beal, shellfish biologist

Abstract: [Stephanie] Getchell and Andrew Boeckeler, both graduate students at the University of New Hampshire, have found that portions of Boothbay have a history of trace metal contamination worse than that of Narragansett Bay or even Boston Harbor. Getchell and Boeckeler are students of Henri Gaudette, a UNH professor of earth sciences. Gaudette sampled the surface sediments of Boothbay Harbor in 1991 and found they contained three to five times more lead, copper, cadmium and zinc than Casco Bay. Getchell and Boeckeler took cores of sediment from seven different spots in the Boothbay Harbor area, covering a distance of 10 miles from the harbor to the Gulf of Maine. The cores ranged from four to six feet long and were analyzed for concentrations of lead, copper, zinc and cadmium. These are the metals commonly found in gasoline, paint, sewage and other substances associated with heavily industrialized areas.

Full text: Stephanie Getchell always thought of Maine as an unspoiled place.
Now, after spending two years studying sediments taken from the bottom of Boothbay Harbor, she's having second thoughts.
Getchell and Andrew Boeckeler, both graduate students at the University of New Hampshire, have found that portions of Boothbay have a history of trace metal contamination worse than that of Narragansett Bay or even Boston Harbor.
"Our results are a little surprising because Boothbay, at least in my mind and I'm sure in a lot of others, has been regarded as a relatively pristine environment," Getchell said. "And it doesn't really appear that it matches that reputation, if one takes a closer look."
Getchell and Boeckeler are students of Henri Gaudette, a UNH professor of earth sciences. Gaudette sampled the surface sediments of Boothbay Harbor in 1991 and found they contained three to five times more lead, copper, cadmium and zinc than Casco Bay.
The new research, a follow-up to that work, looked deeper into the harbor sediments and, therefore, farther back in time. The goal is to establish a historical record of trace metals in Boothbay Harbor, from the inner harbor out to the Gulf of Maine.
Scientists and resource managers then could use the record as a reference for their own work and for making management decisions, such as whether or not to dredge a particular area of the harbor.
Getchell and Boeckeler took cores of sediment from seven different spots in the Boothbay Harbor area, covering a distance of 10 miles from the harbor to the Gulf of Maine. The cores ranged from four to six feet long and were analyzed for concentrations of lead, copper, zinc and cadmium. These are the metals commonly found in gasoline, paint, sewage and other substances associated with heavily industrialized areas.
In the core that was taken closest to shore, Getchell found that the concentration of lead hovered around 10 parts per million until about 1893. But by 1953, it had risen 820 percent to 92 parts per million.
"The concentrations reflect increased industrialization, especially shipbuilding, in that area, which began in the late 19th century," Getchell said. "And then the numbers started to decrease after the Second World War."
The current level is 58 parts per million.
By comparison, levels of lead in the core taken 10 miles offshore changed much less dramatically over the years, from 10 parts per million to 26 parts per million, "which is about normal for the area," Getchell said.
The profiles of copper and zinc were similar, since the metals are often used in combination with one another.
Getchell and Boeckeler presented their findings recently at a meeting of the Geological Society of America in Philadelphia.
"The bad thing about the metals is that they just don't go away with time," Getchell said. "They stay in the sediments, and they don't degrade easily."
They also can accumulate in the tissues of filter feeders such as mussels and clams. The New Hampshire researchers are hoping biologists will followup on their work by testing shellfish to see if they are accumulating harmful levels of trace metals. They will present their results to biologists in May at a meeting of the New England Estuarine Research Society.
The next step is to get a better understanding of what caused the contamination in Boothbay by tracking it down to its origin, using a new technique developed by Gaudette. The technique uses isotopic analysis of lead in the sediments to trace the contaminant to its source.
The isotopic composition of lead differs from source to source. That means each source has its own unique "signature" that can tell the researchers whether it came from gasoline, the atmosphere, a shipyard, or some other place around Boothbay.
At some point, Getchell said, she'll delve into the historical records of the town to see where businesses were located "not so much to point fingers at people and say `Hey, Joe's Fish Yard was responsible for such and such a contamination,' but just to better understand howthese metals have changed with time."
The new isotopic analysis technique already has been used successfully to track contamination from two abandoned mineral mines in coastal Maine.
The Callahan Mine in Castine and the Black Hawk Mine in Blue Hill had polluted both freshwater and marine environments with elevated levels of lead and cadmium. Last year, using isotopic analysis, the New Hampshire researchers found that the Black Hawk Mine had caused more extensive contamination than the Callahan Mine.
They found that cadmium levels in a lake more than a mile away from the Black Hawk Mine were 25 times higher than normal.
Gaudette already has his sights set on his next project.
"My master plan is to move to Penobscot Bay, which is just sitting there waiting to be done," Gaudette said. "There's very, very little data from Penobscot Bay and a lot of potential impacts."

Full text:   Before there was such a thing as a clam-digging permit, Joe Lothrup was digging for clams in Scarborough.
Monday, the 85-year-old ambled into Town Hall and renewed his permit, as he has for more than 11 years. The town's 36 other commercial diggers have until 4 p.m. today to renew their permits.
Lothrup, who has been digging more than 75 years, has been licensed "as long as they've been out - I don't know when that was."
In Scarborough, it has been a dozen years. But this year is different; this year the town is issuing three fewer commercial permits than it did last year.
If any of the 37 licensed diggers do not renew, the town will hold a lottery Friday to determine who gets a permit.
Last year, the town issued 40 licenses. One of the diggers has since died, another moved out of town and became ineligible, and another failed to perform the 12 hours of conservation work the town requires.
Instead of issuing those $200, commercial permits - they cost $400 for non-residents - the town shellfish committee decided to reduce the number of licenses it would issue.
"Our surveys showed there was a reduction in clams, and the surveys were done before the Oct. 21 storm," said David Corbeau, the town's marine resource officer. "Then the October storm moved a lot of dirt around and killed a lot of clams."
The permits are in demand. "We've had as many as 30 people apply for one license before," he said.
The town will issue 33 commercial licenses to residents and four to non-residents.
Corbeau will ensure that people applying as residents actually live in town, and that everyone who asks to renew a license has performed at least 12 hours of conservation work.
That includes tasks like cleaning the beach and reseeding the flats.
While the town has reduced the number of commercial licenses it isissuing, it is increasing the number of recreational licenses from 175 to 200.
People who have recreational licenses can dig up to one peck of clams a day, and are only allowed to use the clams for personal consumption - selling them is prohibited.
Those licenses cost $25, and people who hold them generally only dig a few days a year, Corbeau said.
The town also is issuing 11 student licenses this year - 10 for residents and one for a non-resident. Applicants must be high school students 18 years old or younger. Their licenses, which are renewable, cost $100 for residents and twice that for non-residents.
Applications for those permits will be available Wednesday.
Lothrup's license already has been renewed, and he said he plans to use it.
"I don't stay out for long, but I'm out there," he said.

OCEAN SPRINGTIME DEEP BELOW THE OCEAN'S SURFACE, THE WAKE-UP CALL HAS BEGUN WITH BLOOMING RED AND YELLOW FLOWERS OF ALGAE FURNISHING LIFE FOR UNDERWATER CREATURES.

Abstract: "It's the spring bloom of phytoplankton," says [Maureen] Keller, whose 20 years spent studying green and blue-green algae has only increased her interest in the earth's most primitive plant form. "Thephytoplankton bloom is the single most important productivity event in the Gulf of Maine. It's a basic building block. When it blooms, it kicks off the life cycle of everything that lives in the gulf." Spreading through the waters south to north until it envelops the Gulf of Maine, phytoplankton grows each spring like fire in the ocean. Its appearance is triggered by increased day length and water temperatures just over 32 degrees. It eventually spreads through all of the north Atlantic, turning the ocean green, while it supports life forms from shrimp to the right whale. In Maine's coastal waters, the green single-cell diatom that is the basic unit of phytoplankton prepares the ocean for summer. Clams and scallops feed on phytoplankton. Shrimp and lobsters eat other small critters that live on phytoplankton.

Full text: On spring mornings at Bigelow Laboratory in Boothbay Harbor, satellite photos on Maureen Keller's computer screen show something scientists at the lab haven't seen for weeks - great dabs of yellow and red color blooming like flowers in the Gulf of Maine.
To Keller, a 42-year-old scientist at the laboratory and specialist in marine algae, the colors prove what the gray ocean 20 feet from her desk hasn't yet revealed to the unaided human eye: The ocean is awakening.
"It's the spring bloom of phytoplankton," says Keller, whose 20 years spent studying green and blue-green algae has only increased her interest in the earth's most primitive plant form. "Thephytoplankton bloom is the single most important productivity event in the Gulf of Maine. It's a basic building block. When it blooms, it kicks off the life cycle of everything that lives in the gulf."
Spreading through the waters south to north until it envelops the Gulf of Maine, phytoplankton grows each spring like fire in the ocean. Its appearance is triggered by increased day length and water temperatures just over 32 degrees. It eventually spreads through all of the north Atlantic, turning the ocean green, while it supports life forms from shrimp to the right whale.
In Maine's coastal waters, the green single-cell diatom that is the basic unit of phytoplankton prepares the ocean for summer. Clams and scallops feed on phytoplankton. Shrimp and lobsters eat other small critters that live on phytoplankton.
"It's just enormously important," says Keller.
Just what is phytoplankton, and why do we need it?
The single-cell marine life evolved 300 million years ago. The oxygen it producesthrough photosynthesis created the earth's atmosphere and continues to supply about 70 percent of the oxygen we breathe. (The other 30 percent comes from trees and other plants on land).
Phytoplankton could be threatened by global warming, says Andrew Thomas, 39, an associate professor of oceanography at the University of Maine in Orono. But so far, he says, studies in the Gulf of Maine have turned up no adverse change.
"We haven't been able to isolate a trend," he says. "The Gulf of Maine is a complex system. It's going to be hard to tie it into a . . . trend over many years."
Algae a diverse bunch
Though it lives in each of the world's seven oceans, marine algae has different cycles depending upon climate. In tropical waters, its numbers are fairly constant year-round. In the north, it floats dormant from November to late winter - then comes to life in explosive spring blooms.
Put a drop of Gulf of Maine sea water under a 50-power microscope this time of year, and it shows what scientists have known for many years: There's diversity in this basic unit of life.
"Some are long and skinny," says Keller. "Some have strange spines with little things sticking out of them. All of them have a silica shell. They basically look like little glass houses - amazingly complete and amazingly beautiful."
But phytoplankton would be useless as food to fish and other species higher on the food chain if it weren't for zooplankton - odd critters 1 to 4 millimeters in length that look like tiny shrimp.
"They have little feelers, dark eyes and tails," says Thomas. "They appear late in April - though there is great variability here - and they feed voraciously on the phytoplankton."
By late spring, large mammals including the right whale move in to feed directly on zooplankton in the North Atlantic. Small herring, alewives and dozens of other small fish also feed on zooplankton. They become meals for terns, puffins and cormorant-like birds called petrols.
To marine scientists, the appearance of phytoplankton and zooplankton is a miracle that supports other miracles.
A show off Mackworth
Mike Mazurkiewicz, 57, a marine ecologist at the University of Southern Maine, shows his students phytoplankton by drawing a plankton net through salt water flowering beneath the Mackworth Island causeway in Portland. "The net comes up with a greenish brown stain," he says, "because of all this greenish brown goopy material consisting of algae cells."
Mazurkiewicz also takes studentsto observe the spring rite of barnacle spawning in waters off Two Lights State Park and Kettle Cove in Cape Elizabeth. Barnacles feed on phytoplankton and can sense the presence of the one-celled diatoms as early as March. They begin feeding and, in the following weeks, expel billions of free-swimming barnacle larvae.
"They're shrimp-like," he says, "and for a month they're totally different anatomically from the adult barnacle. When they cement themselves to a solid object (with glue extruded from glands in their head), their legs are used to bring food into their mouths."
By the time he's done, Mazkiewicz's class knows that sea urchins feed on phytoplankton, as do sandworms and myriad other creatures. "It's an eye-opening experience for them," he says.
Non-scientists also feel the effect of rising sea water temperatures and plankton in the water.
James MacLeod, 53, of Brunswick, digs soft-shell clams by spotting their siphon holes in the soft mud and plucking them out by hand. Wearinga rubber suit and insulated gloves, he's able to work year-round. But MacLeod has a problem in winter: From November to March, clams make no blow holes in the mud, and he has to guess their whereabouts.
According to Dana Wallace, a 79-year-old retired marine scientist widely known as "Mr. Clam," the clams don't siphon because water temperatures are low and their food - phytoplankton - isn't available in winter. "They just sort of hibernate," he says. "They do nothing. So in winter, a clam digger digs blind."
When the holes appear, MacLeod celebrates. "It's beautiful out there," he says. "By May, I don't have to wear the neoprene. Sometimes I bring a net out and net me four or five or half a dozen crabs."
Grow your own
So important is phytoplankton to seafood farmers that some clam and oyster growers jump-start mother nature by growing it themselves.
William Mook, 43, produces 150 million baby clams and oysters per year at Mook Sea Farm in Walpole. He sells the 1- to 3-millimeter-long clams and oysters to farmers who seed the ocean bottom, and he grows phytoplankton to feed his babies to salable size.
Late in winter, when sea water temperatures are cold and major phytoplankton growth has yet to occur, Mook uses oil-fired boilers to warm sea water in his 6,000-square-foot hatchery. A special water fertilizer feeds phytoplankton-containing sea water in the tank, while florescent light makes the algae grow. Baby clams and oysters feeding on the rich brew grow to seedling size in four to eight weeks after spawning.
Phytoplankton does more than keep him in business, says Mook. "It forms the basis of the entire food chain," he says, "and is fundamental to all life."
Besides the common green and blue-green phytoplankton in sea water, the area between high and low tide has its own bloom of different algae varieties. Robert Vadas, 60, an expert on the tidal zone who teaches at the University of Maine, describes a plant soup so thick in the tidal area that visibility drops from around 50 feet in winter to between 5 and 15 feet in spring.
Periwinkles crawl from beneath rocks to eat the phytoplankton on beaches and quickly become food to gulls and ducks. "A heck of a lot happens over a relatively short period of time," says Vadas. "The whole inter-tidal zone changes from a bleak winter landscape to a place with all kinds of life. Sometimes it's slippery to walk on."
By late May, the great phytoplankton bloom of late winter and early spring is past peak. It has been eaten by hundreds of life forms including mussels, clams, snails and - especially - zooplankton. And, as Keller explains, it has used up much of the nitrates and other fertilizers kicked up by winter storms.
But there's enough phytoplankton and zooplankton left to feed the myriad creatures who depend on it, including some of the earth's largest mammals. Right whales and Sei whales live on zooplankton, which they filter from ocean water with thin, finger nail-like bone hanging from the roofs of their mouths. Other whales feed higher on the food chain, yet all depend ultimately on the microscopic diatom.
By late spring and early summer, Dan Libby finds so much algae-dependent life immeasurably exciting. A 53-year-old biology teacher at Bonny Eagle High School in Standish, he owns a whale watch boat out of Portland. In June, he sees an ocean teaming with life. In the air fly geese, falcons, cormorants and various breeds of sea ducks.
Sometimes Libby tunes his depth-finder so its screen shows many million zooplankton, eating algae while they serve as food to larger life forms. "You ride out there," he says, "and there's this essence of life - all dependent on phytoplankton." 'The phytoplankton bloom is the single most important productivity event in the Gulf of Maine. It's a basic building block. When it blooms, it kicks off the life cycle of everything that lives in the gulf.' Maureen Keller, Bigelow Laboratory

Microscopic view of phytoplankton algae, which grows each spring like wildfire in the north Atlantic and feeds everything from barnacles to right whales. Staff art How the food chain awakens In spring, the cold and seemingly lifeless Gulf of Maine is teeming with unicellular life that - through the food chain - supports large fish, whales and shore birds. It also contributes oxygen to the air we breath. Late March & April: Dormant phytoplankton - a unicellular plant - begins to photosynthesize to form algae blooms. It happens in coastal as well as deep water. The phytoplankton's food is nitrates and phosphates stirred up by winter storms. Water temperature is just above freezing. As the process goes on, there is so much phytoplankton growth that water color changes from deep blue-black to greenish blue. By late April: Zooplankton break dormancy in the warm upper layer of the ocean, feeding on the phytoplankton. They are animals half a millimeter up to 4 millimeters in length. They look like shrimp, with little feelers and dark eyes and tails. They feed voraciously and reproduce. The water may be around 40 degrees at this point. By late spring: Larger zooplankton feed both on phytoplankton and small zooplankton. June: Juvenile fish - herring, mackerel, snappers, other coastal species - feed on zooplankton. At the same time, baleen type whales - right whales, blue whales, all that feed by filtering - move in to feed on zooplankton. Birds like terns, gulls, and puffins, feed on small fish that feed on zooplankton. Summer: Sharks, tuna, plus all commercial fish in the upper water congregate (along with whales) at places where phytoplankton and zooplankton tend to stay abundant in summer, such as Georges Banks. p.2C

STATE CONTROL OF CLAM HARVESTING DRAWS ABUNDANCE OF OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS OF A BILL BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE SAY THE MARINE RESOURCE `IS SUPPOSED TO BELONG TO THE STATE.'

Abstract: A bill that would repeal town control and authorize the state to issue licenses to harvest clams anywhere along Maine's coast was criticized Thursday by the clamming industry. Scott Coffin of Waldoboro favored the bill. He said he used to live in landlocked Nobleboro and moved to the coast so he could dig clams. "I'd like to know what entitles an individual to have sole ownership of a marine resource that is supposed to belong to the state," Coffin said. Opponents said a state-run shellfish management program would wipe out clam resources and remove incentives for local clammers to conserve and reseed their own flats. Supporters said the bill is needed to ensure inland residents have access to Maine's coast and clams.

Full text:   A bill that would repeal town control and authorize the state to issue licenses to harvest clams anywhere along Maine's coast was criticized Thursday by the clamming industry.
More than 100 people turned out at a legislative committee hearing at the Augusta Civic Center.
"If we take away local laws I'll be out of a job," said Everett Johnson of Jonesport, who has dug clams for 22 years. "This bill will put me in the poor house and will kill the clamming industry for the next 22 years."
Scott Coffin of Waldoboro favored the bill. He said he used to live in landlocked Nobleboro and moved to the coast so he could dig clams. "I'd like to know what entitles an individual to have sole ownership of a marine resource that is supposed to belong to the state," Coffin said.
Opponents said a state-run shellfish management program would wipe out clam resources and remove incentives for local clammers to conserve and reseed their own flats. Supporters said the bill is needed to ensure inland residents have access to Maine's coast and clams.
The Marine Resources Committee will reconvene Thursday to vote on the proposal. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Marjorie Kilkelly, D-Wiscasset, said the bill stands little chance of passing because the Legislature wants towns to retain control. She hopes one day to see a new bill that would increase the number of commercial licenses issued to nonresidents. The limit is now 10 percent.
"This (bill) was not done on a lark and it was not something that I did just to shake things up," Kilkelly said. "I did it for those people who are on the losing end of things, who need a voice."
Her bill would make the state Department of Marine Resources responsible for managing the state's clam flats and enforcing clamming regulations. The bill would allow diggers to cross town lines, which is forbidden by the current system.
DMR Commissioner Robin Alden said such a program would cost the state about $1 million a year to run, including the addition of 15 clam biologists and up to 20 shellfish wardens. Alden opposes the legislation.
"The state could not do this without local involvement," Alden told the committee.
The legislation would require the cost of a state license to cover state management expenses. Alden has said the cost of a state license would have to be extremely high.
Brunswick Town Councilor Robert Galloupe was among a delegation of Brunswick officials. Brunswick was cited as having one of the state's best locally run shellfish management programs. The town ensures access for nonresidents by letting them dig in three coves.
"Suffice it to say that the town of Brunswick would not put another penny into this resource if this bill were to pass," said Galloupe.
Opponents spoke for more than 90 minutes - more than twice as long as proponents of the bill.
"We don't own the white-tailed deer in Alna or the salmon in Alna," argued Michael St. Jean, a blood worm digger from that Lincoln County town. "I don't know why Brunswick and other towns feel they have the right to own the clams."
"I think it's a darn shame if people in Augusta and Waterville can't come down to the coast to dig a mess of clams," said another supporter of the bill, Clark Jones of Wiscasset. "That ocean was made for everybody to enjoy."
Jack Schneider, a member of Georgetown's Shellfish Committee, predicted that local volunteers would not help to reseed flats or test flats for pollution if the state took control.
"Volunteerism would most likely dry up," Schneider said. "Any change in the management structure would create chaos. Everyone would want a piece of the action." ____________________________________________________________________ __________

Proponents say inland residents should have access to the resource. Opponents say such a move would quickly wipe out the flats.

Abstract: A public hearing will be held Thursday on a bill that would open clam flats along the coast to anyone with a state license. The bill is expected to be controversial because it would abolish local laws and remove the incentive for local shellfish committees to protect and conserve clam flats. Under the proposal, for example, harvesters from Eastport in Washington County could dig clams in Brunswick. Sponsored by Sen. Marge Kilkelly of Wiscasset, the bill would make the state Department of Marine Resources responsible for issuing clam-digging licenses, for reseeding flats and for enforcing shellfish digging regulations.

Full text: A public hearing will be held Thursday on a bill that would open clam flats along the coast to anyone with a state license.
The bill is expected to be controversial because it would abolish local laws and remove the incentive for local shellfish committees to protect and conserve clam flats. Under the proposal, for example, harvesters from Eastport in Washington County could dig clams in Brunswick.
Members of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee will hold the 2 p.m. hearing in the North Wing of the Augusta Civic Center. Several hundred clam diggers and town officials are expected to attend.
"It's a ridiculous bill," said Brunswick Councilor Eleanor Swanson, who will be among a delegation of town officials at the hearing. "It would wipe out the clam industry in no time at all."
Sponsored by Sen. Marge Kilkelly of Wiscasset, the bill would make the state Department of Marine Resources responsible for issuing clam-digging licenses, for reseeding flats and for enforcing shellfish digging regulations.
Kilkelly says the legislation is needed because inland residents, unless they are lucky enough to get a clam license from a coastal town, can't dig clams for a living.
State law requires that 10 percent of a town's commercial clam licenses be allocated to nonresidents, a requirement Kilkelly would like to see expanded.
"Right now, you can be economically displaced depending on where you live. We don't have that rule for people who want to lobster," Kilkelly said. "It's the only resource we manage based on where the harvester resides . . . we're creating a migrant worker mentality."
Kilkelly said she realizes there is strong opposition to her proposal. She applauds local conservation efforts but says the bill has accomplished what she set out to do - to spur discussion of ways to make clamming more accessible to people who are being shut out.
Robin Alden, commissioner of the state Department of Marine Resources, said the cost of having the state manage clam flats was still being developed by her staff.
Alden said she would need to hire 15 more clam biologists - the state currently employs three biologists - and up to 20 shellfish wardens. The biologists would be full-time state employees, while the wardens would be contract employees. Alden said towns would no longer have an incentive to hire wardens to protect local flats under the Kilkelly proposal.
More study is needed to determine the cost of a state license and whether the licenses should be capped, she said. The bill gives the state until May 1998 to set the cost of a state license, which in theory should be high enough to cover the state's costs.
Though Alden will oppose Kilkelly's bill, she said it does have some merit. It is not fair that some inland residents, who want to dig clams, can't because they don't live in a particular town, she said. Some clammers have flats in their towns but can't dig there because they've been closed due to pollution.
This month, two Washington County clam diggers were convicted of clamming in a closed area and in a conservation area. They were fined $1,300 each.
After their court appearance, Thomas Cook and Robert Carter of Eastport took the unusual step of saying they would support the state regulating clamming because it would protect their livelihood.
Down East clam flats have been unproductive in recent years, driving fears among southern Maine's coastal towns that clammers from Washington County would descend on their towns and wipe out their flats.
Dana Wallace of Brunswick, who is known statewide as "Mr. Clam," said in 1973 there were 5,923 commercial clam diggers. Now, there are only 1,700 harvesters. He said the decline has been caused by clam flat closures in Down East Maine.
"If Marge's bill goes through, it would be like a swarm of locusts moving down the coast," predicted Joel Knee, chairman of West Bath's Marine Resources Committee. "In two years, there wouldn't be anything left to dig for."
Knee, who is opposed to the bill, said human nature would defeat the bill if it's passed.
"The guys in West Bath are not going to reseed their flats so the boys in Waldoboro can dig their clams," he said.

Abstract: Efforts to build a Gulf of Maine Aquarium here have resurfaced in the last several weeks and, in fact, showed some forward momentum. And a new design team already is focusing on how to attract and impress us when it opens. But, as modern aquariums demonstrate, cute tricks are out. The idea is to wow visitors by showing amazing but seldom seen real-life dramas performed everyday and night in the ocean. Things like luminescent plankton making the ocean surface glow at night, lobsters foraging and battling in forests of sea kelp, or bivalves struggling for survival in the mud. Last week, school kids, fishermen, marine biologists, conservationists and others got to have a little fun helping the new design team brainstorm themes and exhibits for the aquarium. Cute animal perfomances weren't high on anyone's list.

Efforts to build a Gulf of Maine Aquarium here have resurfaced in the last several weeks and, in fact, showed some forward momentum. And a new design team already is focusing on how to attract and impress us when it opens.
But, as modern aquariums demonstrate, cute tricks are out. The idea is to wow visitors by showing amazing but seldom seen real-life dramas performed everyday and night in the ocean. Things like luminescent plankton making the ocean surface glow at night, lobsters foraging and battling in forests of sea kelp, or bivalves struggling for survival in the mud.
"The problem is we don't challenge people enough in these institutions," said Charles Davis, an experienced aquarium designer from San Francisco hired as part of the local team.
"It's not our inclination to have dolphin shows," said Don Perkins, president of the Gulf of Maine Aquarium Development Corp. "What our job is to figure out what it is that's magic about this place and to serve it up."
Last week, school kids, fishermen, marine biologists, conservationists and others got to have a little fun helping the new design team brainstorm themes and exhibits for the aquarium. Cute animal perfomances weren't high on anyone's list.
"How about lobsters doing tricks?" joked Davis.
"Well, they only do one," said David Cousens, a lobsterman. Cousens, who says he sits and watches the Discovery Channel with his kids, was glad to hear the aquarium wouldn't be a cheap thrill.
"We have to educate our kids," he said, and they want to be educated.
Showing a fish-eye view of the world also would be a natural draw for Maine's fishermen and lobstermen, said Cousens. "All they see is what comes up in their traps."
Supporters, such as Gov. Angus King, are hoping an aquarium here would boost appreciation for the Gulf of Maine. That could translate into more general interest in science and stewardship and would help build public support for marine research and for the wise use of ocean resources, they say.
Not that discussing the design and goal of the aquarium necessarily means an aquarium will be built here any time soon.
Critical hurdles lie ahead: city and state permits for major construction on the waterfront; local reaction to the undisclosed site; and, especially, coming up with about $40 million to build it. Supporters say they will seek a combination of public and private funds and tax incentives.
And there will be continued scrutiny of the market research that says 850,000 people will visit an aquarium here each year. The New England Aquarium in Boston, for example, draws about 1.3 million visitors a year - that's in a city with nearly nine times the population of Portland.
One thing that clearly won't be a problem is finding undersea intrigue, drama or suprises to show visitors.
A group of scientists and fishermen made pitches for their favorite fishes such as the homely goosefish, with its broad head and gaping jaws, or the ocean sunfish, which looks like a giant head with fins. They also told stories about seals and seabirds and plants.
Someone suggested transparent sand to watch clams and worms dig and eat. Or a darkened lobster tank for a look at their active and sometimes violent nightlife.
After hearing about Maine's maritime history, islands, high tides and cold currents and stories about the odd assortment of crittersthat endure the harsh cold in the gulf, Davis called it "a slam dunk."
"The story here is even more interesting than what we had to work with in Monterey," he said. His firm, Esherick Homsey Dodge & Davis, designed the aquarium in Monterey, Calif., that draws 1.7 million people a year.
Without any dolphins leaping through hoops.

Abstract: The 1997 property-tax rate probably will be similar to the 1996 tax rate, Bob Spear, chairman of the Board of Selectmen, said Saturday. In all, municipal spending is down about $2,000 to $265,818, helped by lower transfer station costs and less money owed on debt service. The amount of school spending to be funded by taxes totals $1,245,013, he said. The 1996 property-tax rate was $12.90 per $1,000 of valuation. Residents at Saturday's annual town meeting agreed to spend $150,000 of the town's surplus account to help cover costs and hold the tax rate down.

In all, municipal spending is down about $2,000 to $265,818, helped by lower transfer station costs and less money owed on debt service. The amount of school spending to be funded by taxes totals $1,245,013, he said.
The 1996 property-tax rate was $12.90 per $1,000 of valuation. Residents at Saturday's annual town meeting agreed to spend $150,000 of the town's surplus account to help cover costs and hold the tax rate down.
"When we get done, through all this, we are looking - at the most - (at) probably a one-tenth of a mil increase," Spear said, which would bring the tax rate to $13 per $1,000 of valuation.
The total for municipal and school spending residents accepted Saturday is $1,510,831. Spear said the town will owe about $85,500 more in county taxes, bringing the total to about $1,596,331.
Residents agreed to borrow $45,000 to pay the town's share of replacing the Oak Hill Oyster Creek Bridge. Spear said the state will pay the remainder of the $141,000 cost of the new bridge. The money will be paid back over three years.
Voters also decided to set aside $2,000 to study the town office space. Spear said town officials are looking into the possibility of building a new town office and wanted money for the study.
Spear said a formal presentation on the town's options will be given at the 1998 town meeting.
Spear said residents at Saturday's meeting had "a lot of good questions and discussions, but all (were) very civil."
Town officials elected Friday were announced at Saturday's meeting. In the only contested election, Dale Wright was re-elected to the Board of Selectmen, defeating Joan Hallowell. Kurt Maynard was re-elected to a one-year term on the School Committee, and Rick Cronkite and Jim Cosgrove were elected to three-year terms on the committee.

Abstract: Federal environmental officials Tuesday fined the Wells Sanitary District $50,000, alleging its treatment plant discharged too much chlorine into the ocean, posinga risk to shellfish. "We're going to fight this," said Dennis Thayer, superintendent of the Wells Sanitary District. "The check isn't in the mail." Thayer said on several occasions the amount of chlorine exceeded federal levels, but he said it was "miniscule amounts . . . less than in your drinking water."

Full text: Federal environmental officials Tuesday fined the Wells Sanitary District $50,000, alleging its treatment plant discharged too much chlorine into the ocean, posinga risk to shellfish.
The Environmental Protection Agency said the violations occurred off and on since 1993.
Sewer district officials dispute the seriousness of the pollution.
"We're going to fight this," said Dennis Thayer, superintendent of the Wells Sanitary District. "The check isn't in the mail."
Thayer said on several occasions the amount of chlorine exceeded federal levels, but he said it was "miniscule amounts . . . less than in your drinking water."
Chlorine, a disinfectant, kills bacteria and in high concentrations can kill marine life, such as clams, or prevent them from reproducing.
John McNeil, senior enforcement counsel for the EPA's regional office in Boston, said marine organisms such as clams are much more susceptible to tiny amounts of chlorine than humans because they live in water.
"We're talking about the marine environment," McNeil said. "A discussion about drinking water isn't material."
The district has three weeks to appeal the citation.
State environmental authorities say the alleged violations may not be serious.
"There's really a question as to how bad this situation is," said Stuart Rose, a water resources supervisor with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
Rose said he was seeking to determine why federal officials levied a fine. "We're going to go through their records and will put together a history of this case for ourselves to determine how we are going to respond," he said.
Rose said the treatment plant is improving its dechlorination system to keep the amount of chlorine in the effluent within federal guidelines.
Eric Hall, an EPA environmental engineer, said the treatment plant on several occasions discharged too much chlorine into the ocean as part of its treated wastewater. He did not know how many times it has happened.
The Wells plant was one of six in New England cited by the EPA for discharge violations.

Full text: The height of ecological folly, Aldo Leopold wrote, is to ask of a species: What good is it? The question was asked repeatedly, in one form or another, by opponents of Maine's endangered species act at a recent legislative hearing. From legislators to outdoors people who should have known better, opponents had a high old time at the spe- cies' expense. Leopold didn't come up.
If the people of Maine ever needed a reason to doubt the wisdom of turning over the listing of endangered and threatened species to the Legislature, this was it. All the high theater and frivolity drowned out the voices of reason that argued for returning the process to those with the expertise to make such life-and-death decisions (L.D. 580).
Nor could the voices that pleaded for the addition of 20 species to the state's endangered list (L.D. 789) be heard above all the ridiculing by opponents.
If opponents had been listening, they would have heard Rep. Bob Fisk, R-Falmouth, say: "Considered in isolation, the loss of a species of no known value may seem a small price to pay for immediate economic benefit. Yet many species (known and unknown), because of their unique genetic code, may have the potential to greatly benefit future humanity with new pharmaceuticals, food, building and fiber materials."
Perhaps the most endangered creature on the proposed new list is the Katahdin arctic, a small, nondescript butterfly found nowhere else in the world but on its namesake mountain. There, it is under assault from poachers, who know a single pair can bring hundreds of dollars from an unethical collector.
Yet to opponents, the idea of listing any insect (or mollusk), no matter how threatened, was hilarious.
Extinction is no laughing matter. As Fisk says, "When we destroy just one species, we are destroying an ancient lineage forever. We have wiped out a part of Maine's living history."
Legislators should act accordingly.

Robert W. McIntosh, 64, of Oyster River Road, who ran a local radio shop, died Saturday at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport after a long illness.
Mr. McIntosh ran Mainely Radio, first from a shop he built in back of his house and then from the home's "summer kitchen."
His grandchildren remembered visiting their grandfather while he worked on radios and appliances, and sometimes helping him.
"I'd help him take apart the radios and then hand him the parts," Robert Doak, 16, one of Mr. McIntosh's 14 grandchildren, recalled Sunday.
He recalled helping his grandfather build benches in the shop. And, he said, he will never forget his grandfather's "business partner," a little dog named Frank.
Frank always sat on the counter next to the cash register in the radio shop, adding a homespun quality customers enjoyed.
Doak also recalled one day when his grandfather tried to persuade a skeptical customer that Frank was his business partner. The radio shop often received mail addressed to both Mr. McIntosh and his four-legged companion.
The dog won the family's heart the day he blocked the door of Mr. McIntosh's truck, refusing to allow him to get inside because the truck was on fire.
Born in Littleton, Mr. McIntosh was a son of Sylvester W. and Jennie F. Flewelling McIntosh. He lived in Littleton and Gardiner during his childhood years, and as a teen-ager moved to Willoughby, Vt., and graduated from high school in Barton, Vt.
He was an Army veteran of the Korean War. Following his military duty, he moved to Pekin, N.Y., where he was employed with Bell Aircraft Corp.
Prior to his illness, Mr. McIntosh worked more than nine years with the Samoset Resort's maintenance department. He also worked at Marine Colloids and Marine Hydraulics in Rockland.
On June 20, 1958, he married MarieL. Reynolds in Sanborn, N.Y. They moved to Warren in 1963 and had resided here since.
He was a past member and chaplain of the Rockland Lodge of Elks, and a member of the Grace Bible Fellowship in Rockland. He was a devoted family man.
He is survived by his wife of Warren; four sons, Robert W. Jr. of Kenai, Alaska, Ernest W. of Waldoboro, Lee W. of Nicholsville, Ky., and Terrance W. of Anchorage, Alaska; two daughters, Kim M. McIntosh of Rockland and Tammy R. McIntosh of Warren; two brothers, Sylvester W. Jr. of Auburn and Walter Friend of Rockland; two sisters, Geraldine Roberts of Rockland and Wilma Weed of Pittston; and 14 grandchildren.
A visiting hour will be held from 10 to 11 a.m. Tuesday at the Grace Bible Fellowship, 270 Park St., Rockland, immediately followed by a celebration of his life, with the Rev. Peter Sheff officiating.
Burial will be in Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery, Augusta. Funeral arrangements are by the Burpee-Strong Funeral Home, Rockland.

WE'RE REVERSING THE TIDE WITH CLEANER OCEAN WATERS AFTER DECADES OF ANTI-POLLUTION EFFORTS, COASTAL WATER IS GETTING BETTER

Abstract: "The bottom line is that Maine isn't one of the real problem sites," said Gunnar Lauenstein, manager for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Mussel Watch Project. For the past 10 years, scientists have been monitoring 150 sites along the nation's coastlines, including Kennebunkport and Sears Island. The study, which will continue, shows steady reductions in trace elements, including copper, lead and mercury. "In the 1970s, environmental laws were passed to ban the very contaminants we look at and so the question is, have these laws been effective in reducing contamination in the environment," Lauenstein said. "For themost part the concentrations are decreasing in the environment, so the bottom line is that environmental legislation seems to have been effective."

Full text: Correction published Saturday, March 8, 1997: A photo caption Monday on Page 1C should have said the man looking for treasures buried in the sand was at Kennebunk Beach. It was a photographer's error.
Scientists scooping mud from rocks and tidal flats along Maine's coast are finding the least amount of pollution in mussels and oysters in decades.
"The bottom line is that Maine isn't one of the real problem sites," said Gunnar Lauenstein, manager for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Mussel Watch Project.
For the past 10 years, scientists have been monitoring 150 sites along the nation's coastlines, including Kennebunkport and Sears Island. The study, which will continue, shows steady reductions in trace elements, including copper, lead and mercury.
The results are encouraging to environmentalists who hoped stricter regulations on stack emissions and sewage disposal adopted over the past 20 years would reduce offshore pollutants.
"In the 1970s, environmental laws were passed to ban the very contaminants we look at and so the question is, have these laws been effective in reducing contamination in the environment," Lauenstein said. "For themost part the concentrations are decreasing in the environment, so the bottom line is that environmental legislation seems to have been effective."
The Mussel Watch Program, headed by Thomas O'Connor, chief of NOAA's coastal monitoring branch, began in 1986. Metals and organic chemicals, including banned pesticides DDT and chlordane, are measured in sediments, mussels and oysters along the coast.
Measured twice since 1986, results both times showed downward trends since the study began. The chemicals measured can be toxic to marine life and, in high concentrations, to people. In Maine they didn't exceed federal Food and Drug Administration seafood safety guidelines.
Shellfish such as mussels, oysters and clams are used to study marine pollution because they are filter feeders, explained Michael Mazurkiewicz, biology professor at the University of Southern Maine in Portland.
"They filter microscopic organisms out of the water, like algae, and organic particles," Mazurkiewicz said. "That'swhat they feed on. So if what they are feeding on contains contaminants, they would pick it up in their tissues."
The shellfish "are good organisms for monitoring conditions of the water over the longterm, and they are easy to collect," Mazurkiewicz said.
The federal shellfish monitoring report showing a downward trend in marine pollution reflected a similar project being done by the state, said John Sowles, director of the marine program for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
The Mussel Watch Program on both the federal and state levels "is designed to determine the effect of toxics on marine coastal water - whether things are getting better, staying the same or getting worse," Sowles said. "If they're staying the same or getting worse, all those millions of dollars in sewage treatment laws and treatment plants are a waste. We're at least working in the right direction."
In addition to the sites in Kennebunkport and Sears Island, which have been monitored by the federalprogram, Sowles monitors several points in Casco Bay. He said the bay is showing similar declines in contaminants, including pesticides. "On the whole it looks really good," he said. "The hot spots are almost predictable, which is good."
Areas that show the most marine pollution are generally near industrial sites, and this is the case not only in Casco Bay but in the northern area of Maine, such as Sears Island, officials said.
For instance, high levels of mercury off Sears Island are because of industries near the bay that have contaminated the water over the years, Sowles said.
The concentrations of chemicals are measured in parts per million. In general terms, the Food and Drug Administration has limits for these amounts for human consumption.
Sowles said he hopes the public will consider the health of the ocean not only in terms of human safety but in terms of the health of marine life, the basis of much of the ecosystem.
Testing of marine contaminants will continue next month off Kennebunkport, where Lauenstein will be taking samples of mud and silt sediment along the coast.
He'll be equipped with what is called a "grab sampler." It's a stainless steel device with a little jawed bucket on the end. When it's placed on the bottom of the ocean, the jaws grab the top few inches of sediment. The top few inches of particles are analyzed at a Texas lab.
The results of such studies are watched closely by the fishing industry, which depends on healthy mussel populations, said Paul Anderson, public health division director for Maine Department of Marine Resources.
"The mussel industry has certainly grown in the last couple of decades," Anderson said. "The fishing pressure is what I would call heavy. Based on the number of inquiries I've received in the last year or two, there are less of them available." "For the most part the concentrations are decreasing in the environment, so the bottom line is that environmental legislation seems to have been effective."

Abstract: The tomah mayfly, a rare insect normally found on just a handful of streams in Maine, buzzed into the halls of the State House on Friday. It droned into a legislative hearing room, where Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Commissioner Ray B. Owen tried to convince state lawmakers that it belonged on Maine's list of threatened and endangered species. Confusion, disbelief and conflict marked the debate as the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee considered a bill that would add the tomah mayfly and 19 other species to the list of creatures protected under Maine law.

Full text: The tomah mayfly, a rare insect normally found on just a handful of streams in Maine, buzzed into the halls of the State House on Friday.
It droned into a legislative hearing room, where Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Commissioner Ray B. Owen tried to convince state lawmakers that it belonged on Maine's list of threatened and endangered species.
"Is that an animal?" asked Rep. Ruel P. Cross, a puzzled Republican from Dover-Foxcroft.
"Yes," Owen replied.
"Damn!" Cross said.
Confusion, disbelief and conflict marked the debate as the Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Committee considered a bill that would add the tomah mayfly and 19 other species to the list of creatures protected under Maine law.
The controversial measure represents the first state effort to give insects and other small creatures the kind of protection usually associated with the bald eagle and the wolf.
Supporters said the proposed additions to the list merit protection, even though they lack the glamour and popular appeal of more familiar animals.
But critics questioned how the statewas investing its time and money.
"We believe the department has failed to set priorities," said George Smith, executive director of the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine.
Ten insects, seven birds, two mollusks and one fish comprise the list of animals proposed for status as endangered or threatened species.
They range from relatively well-known animals like the Atlantic puffin to obscure ones like the ringed boghaunter - a damselfly found in one York County swamp.
Owen, the fish and wildlifecommissioner, said the species nominated for listing have undergone extensive scientific study to verify that they need protection.
He said listing the animals as threatened or endangered would provide immediate help by making it illegal to poach or collect them.
Jody Jones, a staff member at Maine Audubon Society, testified in favor of the bill. She said the animals could benefit humans in ways that are not yet understood.
For example, Jones said, mussels like the one proposed for listing helpto keep water clean by filtering out pollutants. They are also being studied by medical researchers because of their unusual resistance to tumors, she noted.
Jones also argued that the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife bears responsibility for protecting all forms of wildlife, not just game animals. Wildlife is wildlife, she said, whether it be a moose or a mayfly.
But Smith, representing the Sportsman's Alliance, disagreed.
In the hearing's moment of high theater, he stood before thecommittee with his right hand in the air, balancing a wooden plaque with the mounted head of a deer. Between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand, he squeezed a mayfly.
"Until we have enough of these," he said, holding the deer trophy aloft, "we think it's the height of folly to be working on these," the insect.
He urged the committee to delete all insects and mollusks from the list.
The panel indicated it would take a closer look at the bill in a work session. Sen. Marge Kilkelly, D-Wiscasset, urged Owen to send staff members to the session to answer questions about individual species.
Friday's hearing marked the Legislature's first opportunity to approve additions to the state endangered species list since it was given that authority in 1995.
The power to list species previously rested with the fish and wildlife commissioner and an advisory committee to his department.
In a separate hearing Friday, lawmakers heard arguments on a bill that would restore the commissioner's authority to make listings and take the decision away from the Legislature.
Proponents argued that listing species was a decision that should be made by scientists and not by politicians, but most committee members disagreed. PROPOSED CHANGES TO STATE'S ENDANGERED, THREATENED SPECIES LISTS

Abstract: Officials of Maine's clam industry want no part of a proposal that would repeal local shellfish laws and give clam diggers the right to harvest clams anywhere in the state. "There's a fairness issue here," said state Sen. Marjorie L. Kilkelly, D-Wiscasset, who has introduced the bill in the state Legislature. "Not all Maine people are being treated the same. Clam licenses are regulated by town borders. We don't have local lobstering or deer (hunting) ordinances. They are not based on where you live." Critics say Kilkelly's bill would remove the incentive for local shellfish committees to reseed clam flats and do other conservation work, especially since their efforts would benefit nonresidents. They also fear that productive clam flats would be wiped out by hordes of diggers from other towns.

Full text: Officials of Maine's clam industry want no part of a proposal that would repeal local shellfish laws and give clam diggers the right to harvest clams anywhere in the state.
Under the proposal, a clam digger could buy a commercial license from the state and be allowed to dig anywhere along thecoast. The digger would no longer need to compete for the limited number of nonresident commercial licenses coastal towns now allocate.
The state Department of Marine Resources, not individual towns, would become responsible for enforcing shellfish regulations.
"There's a fairness issue here," said state Sen. Marjorie L. Kilkelly, D-Wiscasset, who has introduced the bill in the state Legislature. "Not all Maine people are being treated the same. Clam licenses are regulated by town borders. We don't have local lobstering or deer (hunting) ordinances. They are not based on where you live."
Kilkelly introduced LD 1122, An Act to Repeal Municipal Shellfish Ordinances, to the Legislature last week. It was referred to the Marine Resources Committee for further review.
A public hearing on the bill has not been set. The legislation was co-sponsored by Rep. Paul M. Chartrand, D-Rockland, and Rodney W. McElroy, R-Unity.
Kilkelly believes that a person who wants to support his family by digging clams should have a reasonable expectation of being able to do that, year after year. She also wants all residents to have access to a marine resource that is currently regulated by town borders.
Local shellfish licensing programs offer no guarantees to people who live in other towns.
There are 34 local and regional shellfish committees along Maine's coast. Those committees hire wardens to enforce local laws, which restrict the number of commercial shellfish licenses. State law requires that 10 percent of a town's license total be offered to nonresidents.
Critics say Kilkelly's bill would remove the incentive for local shellfish committees to reseed clam flats and do other conservation work, especially since their efforts would benefit nonresidents. They also fear that productive clam flats would be wiped out by hordes of diggers from other towns.
"Marge's bill would produce gold-rush types of events that could wipe out an entire resource," said Sherman Hoyt, project coordinator for the St. George River Clam Project in Thomaston. "Her bill would overturn a long tradition of local control . . . . We're talking about a revolutionary change."
"I contend that if we open up the entire state at the same time (to digging) you won't have that kind of pressure in one place," Kilkelly said. "It's supply and demand. People won't go where there are no clams. It will work itself out."
A need for management
In 1963, the Legislature gave towns the authority to manage local clam flats and regulate the numbers of licenses issued to residents and nonresidents. Before 1963, all a clam digger needed was a license from the state.
"The volume of clams decreased (under the old system)," said Alan Houston, Brunswick's Natural Resources director. "We've learned our lesson. There has to be some sort of management . . . The question is who is going to do that."
Houston and other industry officials say the state does not have the staff, money or desire to replace the work currently being done by local shellfish committees.
Houston said Brunswick, whose clam flats are valued at $4 million to $5 million for 1997, will lobby against Kilkelly's bill.
Will Hopkins, project manager for the Cobscook Bay Clam Restoration Project in Eastport, said the nine towns he represents worked hard to reopen clam flats previously closed because of pollution.
Last year, the project was responsible for reopening more than 2,000 acres of flats around Cobscook Bay. He said the industry is on the rebound because of local interest and conservation efforts.
"My gut reaction is . . . it's distribution of power in the wrong direction (to the state). The responsibility for managing resources needs to lie with individual harvesters and their towns," Hopkins said.
As a solution, Hopkins suggests changing state law so that towns can issue more nonresident licenses.
Productivity declining
Dr. Brian F. Beal, an assistant professor of ecology at the University of Maine at Machias, said the legislation could not come at a worse time. Clam-flat productivity is on the downturn. By opening up the state to digging, the resource will continue to suffer, he said.
Kilkelly's bill assumes that local shellfish committees will continue their work after local control is extinguished, Beal points out.
"Volunteers, shellfish harvesters, shellfish committees and local elected officials work hard to manage the resource and improve water quality because they know there will be direct dividends for themselves and neighbors. Once local control is extinguished, there will be no incentive to undertake these management activities," Beal said.
The prospects for the bill's passage diminished last week. Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden is skeptical the program could work, and a key member of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee said he could not support the bill.
"There is a great benefit to local people from being invested in their local resources," Alden said. "Peoplefeel a sense of stewardship and it's a powerful incentive."
If a single state license system were to be implemented, Alden said, "It is going to be a very expensive license."
Kilkelly's bill would not abolish local shellfish committees. It would provide those committees with the opportunity to apply for state grants that could be used to fund conservation activities.
Even so, Rep. David Etnier, D-Harpswell, co-chairman of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee, said he cannot support the legislation.
"I've seen the people who have put in thousands of hours of conservation work on the local level," Etnier said. "Without that kind of effort, the state just wouldn't have the money to conserve clam flats."

From where State Sen. Marjorie L. Kilkelly, D-Wiscasset, sits, there is little difference between issuing a deer-hunting license and a license to harvest clams.
Deer hunters can shoot game throughout the state. Why not offer clam diggers the same privilege?
Kilkelly is the principal sponsor of L.R. 2210, "An Act to Repeal Municipal Shellfish Ordinances." The bill, which has not gone to a public hearing yet, would eliminate the need to buy clam licenses locally by creating a single licensing system that would be administered by the state Department of Marine Resources. The new licensing system would take effect in May 1998.
A commercial clam digger from Wiscasset, for example, could purchase a license from the state that would allow him to dig anywhere along the Maine coast. The state would be responsible for enforcement.
The one-license system would create an open market for commercial diggers, whose livelihoods are often uncertain due to sudden closures, lotteries, and local restrictions. The state had a similar system about 20 years ago.
Under Kilkelly's legislation, anyone could apply for a recreational license, but would be restricted to harvesting one peck per day. Kilkelly is not sure how much a state license would cost.
Rep. Paul M. Chartrand, D-Rockland, and Rep. Rodney W. McElroy, R-Unity, are co-sponsors.

Abstract: An agreement that gives clammers from Phippsburg and West Bath the right to dig across town borders could be terminated tonight at a special town meeting. Members of West Bath's Marine Resources Committee will propose ending the reciprocal agreement the two towns have honored since the late 1980s. West Bath clammers say the agreement has turned into a one-way deal, with Phippsburg clammers getting all the benefits. Last year, the town of Phippsburg did not issue any reciprocal licenses to West Bath clam diggers. On the other hand, West Bath issued 24 reciprocal licenses to Phippsburg clammers, nine more than the town issued to its own residents.

An agreement that gives clammers from Phippsburg and West Bath the right to dig across town borders could be terminated tonight at a special town meeting.
Members of West Bath's Marine Resources Committee will propose ending the reciprocal agreement the two towns have honored since the late 1980s. West Bath clammers say the agreement has turned into a one-way deal, with Phippsburg clammers getting all the benefits.
The matter will be put to a vote today at a special town meeting at 7 p.m. in the West Bath School.
Last year, the town of Phippsburg did not issue any reciprocal licenses to West Bath clam diggers. On the other hand, West Bath issued 24 reciprocal licenses to Phippsburg clammers, nine more than the town issued to its own residents.
West Bath harvesters say the system is unfair because their flats are richer than Phippsburg's, which must be closed whenever there is a sewage overflow from Bath's treatment plant. They also want to protect West Bath's 250 acres of clam flats along the New Meadows River from being overharvested.
"West Bath is a very fertile place. We have lots of shallow flats where clams can grow fast. . . . It's a plum," said Joel Knee, chairman of West Bath's Marine Resources Committee.
Phippsburg and West Bath selectmen say they will do whatever they can to preserve the reciprocal agreement.
Phippsburg Selectman Proctor Wells will ask for permission to speak at tonight's town meeting. He will offer a compromise that reduces the number of reciprocal licenses issued to Phippsburg diggers to just five.
"We have a number of full-time diggers whose livelihoods depend on being able to dig clams in both communities," Wells said. "The selectmen feel there is no need to close the door on Phippsburg."
Wells points out that Phippsburg has more than 2,000 acres of clam flats available, mostly along the Kennebec River. If the agreement is terminated, Wells said red tide outbreaks could shut down all of West Bath's flats, which are located on the New Meadows River, leaving harvesters there with no place to dig.
"We have more than enough clams to support them. I'd hate to see them put all their eggs in one basket," Wells added. "There is a lot to be gained from working together. Selfishness won't get us anywhere."
Ronald Beal, a West Bath selectman, said he and Richard Totten, chairman of the selectmen, are opposed to ending the reciprocal agreement. Selectman Ralph Williams supports the move.
"Phippsburg is our closest and best neighbor," Beal said. "To me, it's a question of morality. You don't change the rules in the middle of the game."
Knee, the marine resource committee chairman, said tensions escalated last year when West Bath reopened Long Cove, a clam flat that had been closed for several years.
A survey, conducted by the towns' shellfish warden, showed 60 percent of clams dug at Long Cove last year ended up in the baskets of Phippsburg harvesters.
Knee notes that West Bath issues only 15 licenses a year to local residents, and some residents who wish to dig are not allowed to. Meanwhile, he says, West Bath is granting licenses to Phippsburg residents while denying licenses to its own residents.
"This is not an anti-Phippsburg activity," Knee said. "It's a pro-West-Bath action."
If West Bath residents terminate the reciprocal agreement, Phippsburg would automatically revoke the licenses it issues to West Bath harvesters.

Full text: with sidebar clam flats
Each week, Isabel Lewando collects three small bags of water from the Ogunquit River estuary.
The samples are brought to a state lab in Boothbay Harbor, where Lewando hopes test results will soon prove the river is clean enough to revive a traditional rite of winter weekends here: digging a peck of clams at low tide.
"Going clamming is like going trout fishing or deer hunting or blueberry picking. It's getting closer to a piece of life that's slipping through your fingers all the time," said Lewando, who lives near the estuary. "Have you ever eaten anything that's just an hour out of the garden oran hour out of the water?"
But when diggers waded onto the flats last month for the first time in more than a decade, Lewando and others in town looked on in helpless frustration. The diggers weren't the townsfolk Lewando had envisioned. They were professionals working for an out-of-town shellfish company that had won special state permission to dig the flats.
The clam flats, according to the state, are too polluted to be harvested by Ogunquit people, but not too polluted to be dug by Spinney Creek Shellfish of Eliot. The company is the only one in Maine with the technology to clean clams that are harvested from polluted flats.
"Our business is recovering a resource that could not otherwise be used," said Thomas Howell of Spinney Creek Shellfish. "This is good news for everybody."
Not to people in Ogunquit. Some officials and residents say the commercial dig is a slap in the face. Now they fear the clams will be gone when they finally get their turn.
State regulators disagree, and say there will still be clams in the Ogunquit flats when, or if, the estuary becomes clean enough for Ogunquit residents to start digging recreationally.
It is a coastal Maine dispute with familiar undercurrents: clashes between commercial and recreational interests; between residents and outsiders; and between the state's management of a shellfish resource and a community's desire to control its coastline.
The dispute was hatched a decade ago, when increased coastal development and tighter food safety laws forced the closure of thousands of acres of clam flats along Maine's coast, including the four acres of tidal flats at the mouth of the Ogunquit River.
Because of pollution from the town's sewage plant and other sources, Ogunquit could no longer give traditional recreational permits that allowed 50 people to dig two pecks of clams each weekend from January to March.
In many other communities clam flats have reopened as state officials, communities and volunteers identified and cut off sourcesof pollution and, through water testing, demonstrated that the flats were clean and clams were again safe to eat.
Ogunquit made a clean-up attempt in 1993 by moving the outfall from its sewage treatment plant from the river to the ocean outside of the tidal estuary. Water quality has improved, but not enough for unrestricted clamming.
Volunteers like Lewando, a 68-year-old photographer and former artists' model who's lived next to the estuary since 1963, have not given up. And now, based on the improvement in water quality shown in their samples, the state is considering a January to March opening for the town.
"So far, it's looking pretty good," said Laura Livingston, water quality specialist for the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Residents have started to look forward to clamming.
Then, this winter, without asking the town's permission, the state granted permission to Spinney Creek Shellfish to dig Ogunquit's flats. The special permit is based on subtleties in laws and policy.
If a clam flat is clean and open, the town can decide who digs clams and how many they can dig. However, If a clam flat is entirely or partially restricted because it is polluted, the town has no say.
In the case of Ogunquit, the clam flats are too polluted to be opened for general clamming, but not polluted enough to ban harvesting by Spinney Creek Shellfish. State officials say they're goal is to put clam flats and clam diggers to work whenever possible.
In cases like this, Howell is the only person in Maine who can get the clams to market.
Howell is a physical oceanographer whose office is filled with maps of Maine's coast and corresponding charts of bacteria counts. Lori Howell, his wife and the company's vice president, is a lawyer and an expert in Maine shellfish management laws.
Along with their knowledge, the Howells have an expensive high-tech shellfish processing plant that is heavily regulated by marine and food safety agencies. The walls are pure white, the floors and basins clean.There are two laboratories for testing water and clam meat. And there's a compact water treatment plant that uses ultraviolet rays to purify tidal water for the clams.
The cleaning process, called depuration, is simple.
Clams dug from restricted flats up and down Maine's coast are placed in tanks of recirculating, purified Spinney Creek water for at least 48 hours. The clams themselves do most of the work. The bacteria that can make the clams harmful to eat are stored in the clams' digestive tracts, not in their flesh. That means they can quickly cleanse themselves by switching to a steady diet of pure water. Once in the tanks, the clams start pumping out impurities and sand, which sinks to the bottom of the tanks.
Lab technicians use a blender and sterilized test tubes to test samples of clam meat for bacteria three times during the process. Once clean, the clams are packaged and sent to market, most to supermarkets in Massachusetts.
"This is a superior product," Howell says proudly.
When Spinney Creek's diggers started in Ogunquit, they found a bonanza. Diggers said they'd never seen clams so thick.
Some dug 11 bushels in one low tide, double what is considered a good day's work for a professional and nearly twice what one of Ogunquit's recreational diggers was allowed to dig in a year. In just one low tide, the company's 20 diggers gathered more than four tons of clams.
Normally, said Howell, a digger uses a rake to flip over mud with one hand and grabs a handful of clams in the other. In Ogunquit, the diggers dropped their rakes and reached for clams with both hands; then they reached back for more before picking up their rakes again.
"That's called double two-fisted," Howell said. "They never have that."
The success of the diggers only added to the frustration in town.
"They're taking a tremendous amount of clams out of there," said Bruce A. Locke, Ogunquit's town manager. He said town officials considered filing for a court injunction when the digging began, but decided it would be a wasted effort.
To some in town, that kind of harvest in an area that had always been restricted to small-scale recreational digging is destructive.
"DMR (Department of Marine Resources) should protect the resource, and they set no limits (on Spinney Creek)," said Lewando. "We've never had commercial clamming here. This kind of digging, some of us feel, is like clearcutting. It will leave the clam flats depleted."
Howell and state officials said the productivity of the flats should reassure residents that the commercial dig won't hurt, and may even help, the future town resource.
"We don't want to kill this area. This area is very special," said Howell. "An area can't get that way unless it's tremendously productive."
State officials say they've come to trust Spinney Creek.
"It's to their advantage not to go in there and overharvest those flats," said Hal Winters, a DMR administrator. Spinney Creek manages the digs for a next visit," he said. "They are repeat customers."
Officials also said Spinney Creek's diggers may be helping the flats in the long run because the clams can be killed by toxins if they remain too thick.
"There is a lot of benefit to going into flats, particularly flats that have been closed for a number of years," said Winters. Taking out the mature clams will aerate the mud and make room for younger clams, officials said.
Lewando, ironically, has never dug for clams, though she once enjoyed seeing the annual event from the beach near her home. She jokes that now, at 68, she's too old to start digging.
Hardly.
Last week, Lewando started trudging around with the commercial diggers. She got special state permission - even encouragement - from the state to rescue young clams exposed by the diggers and replant them in nearby areas not so productive. The small clams can freeze or be eaten by birds before the tide comes back and they dig back in.
And Lewando, while discouraged, is still taking weekly water samples and hoping for the best. "I just wanted people to be able to get what they were used to getting out of the resources of the town."

Full text:   sidebar clam flats
Maine laws regarding clams and clam flats go back to British common law and American colonial law, with some modern twists.
Because of competing demands for the resources, shellfish management is an area of recurring conflicts and the subject of legislative proposals in Maine every year. Here's a primer on current laws:
Shorefront property owners hold title to coastal mud flats down to the low-tide line. But the public has a right to cross or use the flats for fishing and navigation. Digging clams on private tidal flats is legal, while sunbathing there is trespassing.
The clams buried in the mud, like any wildlife, are owned by the people of Maine and not by the private property owner. Only when wildlife is captured - in this case pulled out of the mud - does an individual have legal ownership.
Maine coastal communities have the legal ability to control clamming on unrestricted flats if they set up a system to monitor and enforce state laws - such as the prohibition against harvesting clams smaller than two inches across. Communities must meet other state guidelines, too, such as giving a minimum of 10 percent of digging permits to non-residents so that inland diggers have access.
The state determines if a clam flat is too polluted to allow public clam digging. Any restriction on clamming takes management out of the hands of communities. The state must then decide if no digging is safe or if conditional digging is safe, such as during a limited season or by the one Maine company that can dig and then purify shellfish.

Abstract: The Attorney General's Office found no violations of state law or of the Maine Civil Rights Act, which encompasses hate crimes. The state's conclusion, released Friday, was based on a review of a taped radio conversation part-time Cumberland County sheriff's Deputy George Bernier had with Deputy Ted Brissette. On the night of Dec. 28, Bernier, who was working as the town's shellfish warden, told Brissette he would go to Cundy's Harbor Road and "shoot a couple of rounds . . . 10 feet off the pavement." He used the term "Jewish lightning" to refer to a distraught friend he feared might burn down his house. Bernier, in an interview, said the comment about firing guns was a reference to scaring deer off the highway to prevent poaching. Earlier in the week, Bernier called the Jewish Federation in Portland and made a public apology for his remarks about arson.

Full text: The town's shellfish warden, who also works as a part-time sheriff's deputy, has been cleared of any wrongdoing for making remarks considered anti-Semitic and threatening on a police radio.
The Attorney General's Office found no violations of state law or of the Maine Civil Rights Act, which encompasses hate crimes. The state's conclusion, released Friday, was based on a review of a taped radio conversation part-time Cumberland County sheriff's Deputy George Bernier had with Deputy Ted Brissette.
"I personally found the remarks to be disturbing, but there does not appear to be any violation of the law," said David Lauren, special assistant to the Attorney General.
On the night of Dec. 28, Bernier, who was working as the town's shellfish warden, told Brissette he would go to Cundy's Harbor Road and "shoot a couple of rounds . . . 10 feet off the pavement." He used the term "Jewish lightning" to refer to a distraught friend he feared might burn down his house.
Tom Leeman, whose home is 10 feet from Cundy's Harbor Road, interpreted the remarks as threats toward him. Leeman, who taped the radio conversation, provided Sheriff Wesley Ridlon a copy.
Bernier, in an interview, said the comment about firing guns was a reference to scaring deer off the highway to prevent poaching. Earlier in the week, Bernier called the Jewish Federation in Portland and made a public apology for his remarks about arson.
"I feel there was a reasonable expectation of some privacy on that channel," Bernier said. "But, I feel really bad for saying it. It was not intended to offend anyone's religion."
Matthew Goldfarb, spokesman for the Jewish Federation, said: "Jewish lightning is a nefarious term relating to Jewish arson. It's a terrible comment, but I don't know where it originated. It attributes a base criminal activity with being Jewish.
"We're satisfied it wasn't malicious and that it was an isolated incident that has been handled properly by the sheriff's department," Goldfarb said..
The town of Harpswell orally reprimanded Bernier,said Robert Waddle, a town selectman. An investigation by the Sheriff's Department found no misconduct by Brissette. The county will not allow Brissette to comment on the matter.
Leeman, a self-described "scanner freak," said he taped the conversation off the police scanner in his living room. Every night before he goes to bed, Leeman sets up a voice-activated tape recorder to record scanner chatter. He listens to the tape each morning over a cup of coffee.
"I'm disabled," Leeman explained. "My only entertainment is listening to my scanner. It's a small town, and I just like to know what's going on. That morning I got the shock of my life. I certainly felt like I was being threatened."
Leeman has been investigating Bernier's work record as shellfish warden for two years. He photocopies Bernier's time cards because he believes Bernier should spend more time on warden duties.
Bernier works about 20 hours a week for the county and 40 hours for the town.
Leeman is co-chairman of a groupthat calls itself Harpswell Citizens for Better Enforcement. "We have a right to know where our taxes are being spent," he said.
County commissioners listened to the tape, which Leeman said he edited, before turning it over to the Attorney General's Office for review.
"I am Jewish and of course I find it offensive whenever anyone uses a derogatory term, but I also know that in life things like this are said and if it's said during a private conversation, there's nothing we can do to legislate against it," said County Commissioner Esther Clenott.
In separate interviews, Brissette and Bernier explained what they were talking about the night their conversation was taped. They characterized their conversation as "shooting the breeze" over a local police channel they believed was secure. The communication was not picked up by the county dispatch center in Portland.
"I like to talk on the radio, and this (conversation) was nothing more than chitchat in the middle of the night," Bernier said. "I admit it was a foolish thing to do and I apologize for it. It was unprofessional of me." "I feel there was a reasonable expectation of some privacy on that channel. But, I feel really bad for saying it. It was not intended to offend anyone's religion." Part-time Deputy George Bernier

In September 1922, she began teaching in the old stone school in West Warren. In 1923, she taught at the Pleasantville School, and then from 1924 to 1926 at the Oyster River School. In 1927, she moved on to the Hinckley Corner School, and later taught at the Frank D. Rowe School.
For several years, she worked as a weaver with her sisters at the Georges River Woolen Mill, and she was also a waitress at the Life Saver Cabins for Ben and Florence Davis, and at Aunt Lydia's Tavern in Waldoboro. She helped her sister and brother-in-law run a lunch room in Rockland near the junction of Limerock and Main streets.
On retiring in 1972 after more than 50 years of teaching, Miss Castner was honored at a reception that included reading of letters from then President Richard Nixon, Sens. Margaret Chase Smith and Edmund Muskie, Gov. Kenneth Curtis and many other dignitaries.
Miss Castner attended summer sessions at the former Farmington and Gorham normal schools, and took extension courses through Columbia University. She obtained her life certification.
She was a member of the White Oak Grange and the Second Congregational Church. She enjoyed working in her house, gardening and substituting atschool.
She is survived by a nephew and several nieces.
At her request, a graveside service will be held in the spring in the Shuman Cemetery in Waldoboro with the Rev. Vernon Jordan officiating. Arrangements are under the direction of Hall Funeral Home, Waldoboro.

Abstract: To address questions like these, two Maine Sunday Telegram staff members each tackled 10 arbitrary tasks. Jessica Tomlinson used the Internet, while Ray Routhier worked the old-fashioned way - phone calls and legwork. Jessica: The first step is opening the Internet connection. Think of this as clicking on your TV remote. In less than a minute, I'm on the World Wide Web. I go to a site called Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) where I had purchased round-trip tickets to Mexico for less than $300. I'm hoping for another bargain today. Instead, I get a "busy, tryagain later" message. When I try again later, I enter the flight information and ask for the lowest possible fare. I'm given three travel options, the cheapest being a USAir ticket for $568. Ray: A no-brainer. I picked up the Yellow Pages and found the "travel agents" section. I started with Colpitts Travel on Congress Street, because I had booked a trip to Ireland with them. The agent clicked her computer and found a round-trip USAir flight for $284. I figured that was pretty good. But I've heard all these stories about how the Internet has secret places where air fares are cheaper than gumballs, so I decided to keep calling around for a better price. One agency could do no better than $549, but TravelWise Network in Saco uncovered a Continental flight for $281.

Full text: Sidebar Internet
Here's the burning question for folks who haven't yet become intimate with the Internet or the pleasures of better living through computers: Is the Internet really a better way of doing things?
Can you pay less for airline tickets over the Internet than you would through a travel agent? If you wanted to complain to a company about one of its products, could you find the CEO's address address quicker via the Internet or the telephone?
To address questions like these, two Maine Sunday Telegram staff members each tackled 10 arbitrary tasks. Jessica Tomlinson used the Internet, while Ray Routhier worked the old-fashioned way - phone calls and legwork.
It should be noted that Jessica is far from an expert at using the Internet. She learned everything she knows about it by trial an error at the newspaper during the last year. She doesn't have Internet access at home.
The idea was to accomplish eachtask as quickly as possible. Here's how each fared:
1) Find the cheapest airplane ticket to Akron, Ohio, leaving Portland on Feb. 9 and returning Feb. 15.
Jessica: The first step is opening the Internet connection. Think of this as clicking on your TV remote. In less than a minute, I'm on the World Wide Web. I go to a site called Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) where I had purchased round-trip tickets to Mexico for less than $300. I'm hoping for another bargain today. Instead, I get a "busy, tryagain later" message. When I try again later, I enter the flight information and ask for the lowest possible fare. I'm given three travel options, the cheapest being a USAir ticket for $568.
Result: Cheapest price found was $568.
Total time: 17 minutes.
Ray: A no-brainer. I picked up the Yellow Pages and found the "travel agents" section. I started with Colpitts Travel on Congress Street, because I had booked a trip to Ireland with them. The agent clicked her computer and found a round-trip USAir flight for $284. I figured that was pretty good. But I've heard all these stories about how the Internet has secret places where air fares are cheaper than gumballs, so I decided to keep calling around for a better price. One agency could do no better than $549, but TravelWise Network in Saco uncovered a Continental flight for $281.
Result: Cheapest price found was $281.
Total time: 21 minutes.
2) Find the most job leads for a special education teaching position in New York City.
Jessica: I went to the classified section of The New York Times online newspaper (www.nytimes.com). I chose "careers," then "education," confined the search to special education teaching positions and limited the search to the New York area. The result was six matches. Shortening "education" to "ed" produced 15 matches. Asking for last week's listing got me 18 more matches, two of which overlapped with this week's.
Result: Found 31 job leads.
Total time: 7 minutes.
Ray: I began by buying Wednesday's edition of The New York Times, but there were no ads for teachers. I decided I'd get the most job leads by calling the New York City school department. Bad idea. I was put on hold 10 times, transferred eight, and basically told I was crazy for making such an inquiry. A half-hour after my first call, I got a woman in "staffing" who told me I couldn't get any job listings unless I was "New York certified." I'm not. I then walked to the Portland Public Library and found Sunday's edition of The New York Times. Page 39 had 11 ads for special education teaching jobs.
Result: Found 11 job leads.
Total time: 70 minutes.
3) Find a recipe for pad Thai.
Jessica: Using Alta Vista (www.altavista.com) as a search engine (sort of a computerized card catalog), I enter the words `pad thai recipe.' The screen shows a list of all the Web sites that contain these words. I choose the first site, called Karin's Pad Thai Recipe (www.karinrex.com/cooking.html). Bingo. The recipe appears on screen. Time to break for lunch.
Result: Recipe found.
Total time: 1 minute.
Ray: It figures that if a Thai restaurant wants to make money, it won't give away its recipes. That's probably why the folks at a local Thai restaurant seemed stunned when I phoned and asked for their pad Thai recipe. Realizing how dumb that was, I walked back to the Portland library, paid $3.80 in fines on overdue books and browsed the cookbooks. No luck. Since the card catalog has been scrapped, I reluctantly signed on to the computer catalog system and found two Thai cookbooks. The first one I searched out wasn't on the shelf, but the second one was - "Pad Thai Home-Cooking From Kamolmal's Kitchen."
Result: Recipe found.
Total time: 31 minutes.
4) Find a copy of the book "While Six Million Died."
Jessica: I went immediately to one of my favorite sites - www.amazon.com, the home of 1.5 million book titles. Many of the books at this site have reviews by readers, comments by authors and feedback from the publishers. Enter the name of the book, and a photo of the book cover appears on the screen with author, publication date, publisher, ISBN number and ordering information. If I wanted to order it, I would click on the phrase "add to shopping basket." If in stock, it would be shipped in four to six weeks.
Result: Found order form for "While Six Million Died," but got no guarantee the book was in stock.
Total time: 1 minute.
Ray: I called Bookland and was told the store didn't have this book but maybe I could order it from the distributor, Viking Penguin. I called that company, toll-free, and was told the book was not in stock. I could order it, and one would be sent to me if the publisher ever printed more. I then called the University of Southern Maine library in Portland, and a young man there found a copy. I picked it up on my way home from work.
Result: Obtained copy of the book.
Total time: 28 minutes.
5) Find the gestation period of an elephant.
Jessica: It's back to good old Alta Vista to search for "elephant gestation." There's a list of sites, from which I choose "Parc Safari," because the description tells me it's got biological statistics. My answer is in the third line: 22 months. I gloat, thinking it will take Ray at least 30 seconds to walk to the encyclopedia.
Result: Information found.
Total time: 36 seconds.
Ray: Lots of people have an encyclopedia in their home, so I felt it would be fair for me to walk downstairs and use "The World Book Encyclopedia" here at the newspaper. Within a couple of minutes, I was back on the elephant hunt and found this information: "The female (elephant) carries her young for 22 months."
Result: Information found.
Total time: 4 minutes.
6) Get directions to Pike Place Market in Seattle from the airport.
Jessica: I've had some luck in the past getting maps from the site Virtual Tourist (www.virtualtourist.com). A creature of habit, I return. I can't even get into the site after multiple tries because their systemis down. Forget this. Back to trusty Alta Vista to search for Pike Place Market. There are many matches here, but after checking five of them I've got a list of restaurants, some lovely photographs of the city but no maps. Time for a new approach. Enter the words "maps and directions" in Alta Vista. Choose the first site, called Maps on Us (www.mapsonus.com). Score! You enter a starting and ending point, and the program produces a computer-generated map and explicit directions. Using the site's yellow pages, I look up the street addresses for the Seattle airport and Pike Place Market. Drats. It's taking forever to learn how to use this site. OK, 15 minutes isn't forever, but it feels like it when you're staring at the same screen for that long. After rebooting the computer because of a system error, I'm up and running again. It's taken a while, but now I have a map and turn-by-turn directions. This was frustrating and lengthy, but the next time I need a map or directions, I know exactly what site to go to and what information I'll need once I'm there.
Result: Got directions.
Total time: 50 minutes.
Ray: After looking up Seattle's area code (206) in the phone book, I called directory assistance for the Pike Place Market number. The woman who answered gave me directions.
Result: Got directions.
Total time: 4 minutes.
7) Find the name and address of the chief executive officer for Fisher-Price.
Jessica: For finding people or companies, I have two sources - www.switchboard.com and www.whowhere.com. These sites essentially put all of the phone books in the country at your fingertips. The first site had no matches, but the second had the address and e-mail of the toy company. I e-mailed, asking for the pertinent information. After not hearing back from them, I choose not to spend more time on this task. Realistically, at this point, I would use the phone to get the information. Surfing the Web for another hour may get my answer, but it's not worth it time-wise. My mama didn't raise a fool.
Result: Did not find name and address.
Total time: 6 minutes.
Ray: Here's one instance in which my reporting experience may have helped. I know that many big companies list their numbers on a toll-free directory. Just dial 1-800-555-1212. I got the number for Fisher-Price, and a consumer affairs representative game the information I needed: Byron Davis, CEO, Fisher-Price, 636 Gerard Ave., East Aurora, N.Y., 14052.
Result: Name and address obtained.
Total time: 4 minutes.
8) Get a bio on Whoopi Goldberg.
Jessica: My pal Alta Vista to the rescue again. Type in "Whoopi Goldberg bio," and I've got 30 choices. I opt for the snazzy "Mr. Showbiz" bio. Up pops the facts on Whoopi, a/k/a Caryn Johnson.
Result: Biographical sketch obtained.
Total time: 1 minute.
Ray: I walked to the Portland library but came up empty after about a half-hour of trying to work the darned computer catalog system and browsing those "Who's Who" books. I walked across the street to Bookland - no luck. A few minutes more on foot brought me to Books Etc. on Exchange Street. Same deal. I walked back to the office and called the USM library. The young man in reference said they had some updated "Who's Who" books that could help. I drove to USM, about five minutes away, and on the second floor was directed to "Who's Who of American Women." I was pleasantly surprised to find a short but detailed biographical sketch of Goldberg, who began her acting career at the San Diego Repertory Theater in 1975.
Result: Biographical sketch found.
Total time: 90 minutes.
9) Find the cheapest price for a dozen long-stemmed roses delivered to someone at City Hall in Athens, Georgia.
Jessica: Alta Vista revisited. I type in "flower delivery" and get a list of almost 100 matches. Some are "virtual bouqets," a service that sends an image of flowers via e-mail. Not what we're looking for. Using the helpful paragraphs about each site, I choose a general company. Once at the site (www.800aflorist.com), I choose long-stemmed roses from a screen filled with pictures of flowers and then choose the destination. Fee: $55 for the flowers, $5.95 service charge.
Result: Got a price of $60.95.
Total time: 8 minutes.
Ray: I grabbed the Yellow Pages, flipped to "florists" and found an ad for "Worldwide Floral & Gift Delivery Service." I figured if they're worldwide, they deliver to a place as worldly sounding as Athens. So I called the toll-free number and was told I could get a box of long-stemmed roses sent to Athens City Hall for $59.35.
Result: Got a price of $59.35.
Total time: 3 minutes.
10) Find a woman who was last seen by Telegram reporter Lloyd Ferris in 1958, when she was a teen-ager living in Oyster Bay, N.Y. (Her name was given to both reporters but is not being printed, because she was not contacted directly.)
Jessica: Back at the Switchboard site, I find addresses and phone numbers for five people with the name I was looking for. But heck, she could be married with a new last name, and none of these may be the woman we're looking for. Using Switchboard again, I check to see whether there is an e-mail address for the woman. No. Next step is to look for Oyster Bay High School, using Alta Vista. Yes, they have a site, with e-mail even. Sent them a message asking for the current address of their alum. No reply. If the rules for the contest allowed, I would now use the phone to contact my five leads.
Result: Did not find woman.
Total time: 4 minutes.
Ray: I called directory assistance in Oyster Bay to see whether anyone had the last name I was looking for. One man did. I left two messages for him, and he never called back. I also called the Oyster Bay High School but was told all information on former students was confidential. Then I called the town hall, the local library and the Oyster Bay Guardian newspaper. No luck. Then I called Long Island Newsday, the major daily newspaper for that area, figuring it would have marriage and graduation notices on file, but they don't. I also called the chamber of commerce in Oyster Bay and a few other people who had been recommended. After two days of making calls, off an on, I couldn't think of any other place to turn. Then, four days after I started, the woman left a message on my answering machine saying she heard I was looking for her. She said one of the people I called in Oyster Bay was her brother. She said she remembered Lloyd Ferriss and was now living in Philadelphia. She left a phone number. (As of press time, however, Ihad not spoken with the woman directly.)
Result: Found the woman.
Total time: 90 minutes of phone calls, over four days.
Totals
Ray accomplished all 10 tasks, while Jessica completed seven (eight, if you count the book that we might have tried to order). Jessica, though, did five of the seven she accomplished quicker than Ray and got many more job leads. Ray, however, got the lowest prices both times.
Jessica spent 1 hour 35 minutes minutes (and 36 seconds) working on her tasks over the Internet. Ray spent 5 hours 45 minutes on the phone, walking and driving places, and flipping through books.
In conclusion, some tasks can be done much faster on the Internet - the pad Thai recipe and Whoopi Goldberg bio are prime examples. But some tasks can't be completed without talking to a human being. Via the Internet, for example, we found an order form for the book we wanted, but we had to talk to a person to know whether the book was in stock.
Overall, it comes down to how much information you want on a subject and what quality you're looking for. The Internet might be quicker, but the old-fashioned way sometimes works better. ____________________________________________________________________ _____

Abstract: Scientists studying the winter migration habits of the endangered shortnose sturgeon say thousands of the fish are spending the winter near an island above Merrymeeting Bay. Last fall, DOT hired Thomas S. Squiers Jr., a state marine resources scientist, to conduct a sturgeon field study. The $30,000 study uses sonic tags or transmitters implanted in 15 sturgeon to tracktheir movements. Squiers and other scientists already knew the Kennebec River's population of 7,000 to 10,000 sturgeon spent summers in the nearby Sasanoa River feeding off mollusks and large crustaceans on the bottom of such places as Pleasant Cove in Woolwich and Winnegance Creek. But they did not know where the fish spent winters.

Full text: Scientists studying the winter migration habits of the endangered shortnose sturgeon say thousands of the fish are spending the winter near an island above Merrymeeting Bay.
And the sturgeon scientists have been following don't appear to be in a hurry to go anywhere soon.
Their discovery is encouraging news for the state Department of Transportation, which plans to replace the Carlton Bridge, and for Bath Iron Works, which is moving forward with plans to expand the waterfront shipyard.
Although the study commissioned by the DOT won't be completed until July, it would appear both projects can proceed without harming the shortnose sturgeon's existence in the Kennebec River.
The study's findings still must be reviewed and approved by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which enforces the Endangered Species Act, as well as the Army Corps of Engineers.
Last fall, DOT hired Thomas S. Squiers Jr., a state marine resources scientist, to conduct a sturgeon field study. The $30,000 study uses sonic tags or transmitters implanted in 15 sturgeon to tracktheir movements.
Squiers and other scientists already knew the Kennebec River's population of 7,000 to 10,000 sturgeon spent summers in the nearby Sasanoa River feeding off mollusks and large crustaceans on the bottom of such places as Pleasant Cove in Woolwich and Winnegance Creek. But they did not know where the fish spent winters.
"It surprised me that the fish headed upriver and not down," said Squiers, whose previous study of Kennebec River sturgeon's spawning rituals helped the state coordinate construction of the Topsham-Brunswick bypass.
Field researchers, as recently as Tuesday, verified that the study fish are spending the winter on the Dresden side of Swan Island, at the point where the Eastern River intersects the Kennebec River. That is far upstream from Bath, the Carlton Bridge and BIW.
"If we had found the sturgeon were wintering at the Carlton Bridge site . . . that would have knocked us for quite a loop," said Scott Rollins, who is overseeing the study for the DOT.
Rollins said BIW has participated in the study by loaning its tugboat to researchers. The tugboat is able to break through ice and carry researchers to the sturgeon's wintering habitat. He said BIW probably will use the study's research when it applies to the Army Corps of Engineers for a permit.
Meanwhile, DOT has made plans to modify its construction schedule. Rollins said the Carlton Bridge contractor will not be allowed to work on the middle section of the new bridge between April 15 and Oct. 1. That strategy will leave two-thirds of the river channel open to migrating sturgeon.
Bridge construction activity will be confined to daylight hours, limiting work on the new bridge to about 12-14 hours a day during those months. Rollins hopes he can convince the federal government to shorten the restricted period to July through September.
During an earlier study, Squiers identified the Androscoggin River - just below the Brunswick-Topsham hydroelectric dam - as the sturgeon's prime spawning ground. Construction on the bypass is suspended during four weeks in late April and May to prevent disruption of the sturgeon's abbreviated spawning season.
In the current study, Squiers used mesh gill nets to capture 15 sturgeon. In October, an incision was made in each fish's abdominal cavity. A sonic transmitter, about 4 inches long and wrapped in plastic, was sewn into the cavity.
Each transmitter emits a unique sonic pulse, which allows researchers to identify and track individually numbered sturgeon. A transmitter's battery will last up to 18 months. The fish are tracked from boats or by placing receivers through holes cut in ice. A receiver must be within 300 yards of a sturgeon to detect a pulse.
Squiers is cautiously optimistic the fish won't swim downstream before spawning season. His crew will continue to monitor the fish through the winter.
Eventually, Squiers will present his research to the National Marine Fisheries Service in Gloucester, Mass. Its staff will review his findings and render an opinion on whether the bridge project and BIW's planned expansion would jeopardize the sturgeon population.
"We don't pride ourselves on stopping projects from going forward," said Douglas Beach, the fisheries service's protected species coordinator. "We pride ourselves on trying to work with people to minimize the impact a project will have on an endangered population."
During the 19th century, Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon supported a thriving and profitable fishing industry. Both specieswere prized for their caviar, smoked meat and oil. Sturgeon were depleted during the latter half of the 19th century and the early part of this century by intense fishing.
Beach said the major threat to the shortnose sturgeon comes from overfishing, pollution and dredging operations.
According to the fisheries service, shortnose sturgeon can be found in coastal rivers along the eastern seaboard, ranging from the St. John River in New Brunswick, Canada, to the St. Johns River in Florida.
ABOUT THE STURGEON
The shortnose sturgeon is a member of a group of fish that retains many characteristics of the geologic past. One variety, the white sturgeon, is the largest freshwater fish alive today.
The shortnose sturgeon rarely exceeds 3 feet in length and generally weighs 5 to 6 pounds.
It matures at about 14. Females can live up to 70 years.
Its range is mostly in river mouths, tidal waters, estuaries and bays from New Brunswick to Florida.
There are 7,000 to 10,000 adults in the Kennebec-Androscoggin river system. That's the largest population in New England and one of the largest on the Eastern Seaboard.
Shortnose sturgeon are bottom feeders, using whisker-like barbels to find worms and mollusks.
The skeleton is mainly cartilage; several rows of bony plates extend along the body.
The shortnose is one of the smaller varieties of sturgeon. The largest authenticated catch of sturgeon was a white sturgeon caught in a gill net in the Columbia River in Washington that weighed 1,285 pounds.

Abstract: Winter is not the best time to visit San Francisco and the wine country of Napa and Sonoma counties. But my wife had a January meeting in San Francisco, and we decided to tack a week of vacation on the end of that to see the region, visit some wineries and check out San Francisco. If I were to do the tour again, I'd base myself in Healdsburg, staying at the Healdsburg Inn on the Plaza. The bed-and-breakfast had great rooms, antique iron beds and claw-foot tubs, a skylight over the tub in our bathroom, a comfortable and airy gathering room for complimentary afternoon wine and breakfast and friendly and helpful hosts. And while the least expensive room at the inn is $135 in peak season, we spent $65 for the smallest room in January and virtually had the inn to ourselves. Beringer in St. Helena provide the best tour for the history of wine-making and for making intelligent wine choices. You walk through old-fashioned caves dug into the side of a hill and tour a Victorian house that includes two tasting rooms. One room has no-cost tasting for everyday wines and the second charges for some knock-your-socks-off high end wines. The grounds are beautiful.

I had come to California for the wine and I loved it. But enough is enough. After six wineries a day, it was time for a change.

Taste some great wine we did, andwe learned a lot about making wine.
But the rain was steady and a constant threat while we were in wine country. It wasn't as bad as this year, when major flooding occurred, but rivers were high and some lower vineyards were covered with water.
As little as 10 years ago, wine tours and tastings were limited to a few wineries - the ones too small to connect with distribution chains. But now, almost every winery has a tasting room and a lot of them have tours.
We spent three nights in Napa and Sonoma at three different inns. While January is not the best time to visit wineries, it is the best time to get bargains on high-end lodging.
If I were to do the tour again, I'd base myself in Healdsburg, staying at the Healdsburg Inn on the Plaza. The bed-and-breakfast had great rooms, antique iron beds and claw-foot tubs, a skylight over the tub in our bathroom, a comfortable and airy gathering room for complimentary afternoon wine and breakfast and friendly and helpful hosts. And while the least expensive room at the inn is $135 in peak season, we spent $65 for the smallest room in January and virtually had the inn to ourselves.
The restaurant where we drank beer was a short walk through a downpour from the inn. The plaza was great for strolling - a square park with well manicured lawns surrounded by a variety of wonderful shops.
But the real reason I would base myself in Healdsburg is that Napa and Sonoma counties together are about the size of Cumberland and York counties, and Healdsburg sits in the middle of everything. Anyplace you would want to see is an hour or less away, and the views while you're driving are wonderful.
We visited about 18 wineries over three days. The tasting rooms open at 10 a.m., and since we hadn't adjusted from East Coast time we often began our tastings shortly thereafter - after all, it was 1 p.m. in Maine.
The wineries close at 5 or 6, so if you are going to actually swallow what you taste, about one winery an hour is your limit. And have coffee with lunch.
We chose our wineries by the mishmash method. Some we chose because we had enjoyed their wines in the past and wanted to see if they had good wines we hadn't tasted. Some came recommended by tour books. One I chose even though I'd never heard about it because it specializes in gewurtzraminer wine, and I love gewurtzraminer. Others just looked intriguing as we drove by and it had been about an hour since our last tasting.
The wineries
Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville has the best tour if you're interested in the technical end of wine-making. If it weren't raining, the guide would have taken us right into the vineyards. We looked at tubes, stainless steel vats, oak barrels, wine being bottled and more.
Beringer in St. Helena provide the best tour for the history of wine-making and for making intelligent wine choices. You walk through old-fashioned caves dug into the side of a hill and tour a Victorian house that includes two tasting rooms. One room has no-cost tasting for everyday wines and the second charges for some knock-your-socks-off high end wines. The grounds are beautiful.
The guide endeared herself when she freely admitted that Beringer's white zinfandel wasn't very good wine but it was a great money-maker, and that there are meals where you wouldn't want to spend as much money on a wine as Beringer charges.
Korbel Champagne Cellars in Guerneville also has a wonderful setting, including a replica of a tower Korbel's founder could see when he was a prisoner in Europe before he escaped to the United States. The history is fun and you get a good tour with a chance to see how sparkling wine is made.
Sterling Vineyards in Calistoga would have been a wonderful stop, with an aerial tram ride to the 541-foot-high winery providing great views. The forecast was for clearing and we drove by the winery three times, but each time it was pouring.
Hop Kiln Winery in Healdsburg was our favorite find. We showed up at the converted 1905 hop-drying barn shortly after 10 a.m. on a cold and rainy morning. The woman who ran the tasting room was a bit grumpy at first, sipping coffee and wondering why anyone would drink wine so early on a cold morning. But once we showed a strong interest in the history of the building and the wines, she warmed up to us.
The wines are inexpensive - $12 tops - and absolute top quality. Marty Griffin's Big Red has beat out the $50 Opus One in tastings and is wonderfully complex, the Thousand Flowers blend is a greater summer-sipping wine and the sauvignon blanc is a great white. Since Hop Kiln wine is not distributed in Maine, we shipped some home and will order by mail in the future.
Gundlach Bundschu Winery in Sonoma offered a chance to visit in person the winery that has made some of my favorite wines. The tasting room was the friendliest we found, and it offered several wines you can't buy in Maine. A harvest mural outside the tasting room makes it worth the trip by itself.
Murphy-Goode Winery in Geyserville was a winery we stopped at just because it was time to stop. There was no tour, and the tasting room was plain. But we were waited on by one of the Murphys, and the wines - especially the pinot blanc - were as fine as any whites I have tasted anywhere. I have become a regular Murphy-Goode customer.
Z. Moore is on a back road in Windsor, just south of Healdsburg, and we got lost looking for it. The tasting room was bland. I couldn't see a grape vine anywhere out the windows. The gewurtzraminer wines are wonderful.
Non-wine attractions
Limiting ourselves to six wineries a day, there was a good deal of time that we spent in non-wine activities in Sonoma and Napa valleys. Here are some of the highlights.
Robert Louis Stevenson State
Park in Calistoga is just one wrong turn from the north of Napa Valley if you're trying to get to Sonoma Valley. Stevenson spent his honeymoon in this area in 1880. The area is now undeveloped parkland with trails to the peak of Mount St. Helena and a nature trail past an old silver mine. It was raining hard, so we didn't get to do any of that. The scenery is steeply hilly, but the lush growth continually surprised us as Easterners.
Old Faithful Geyser of California, in Geyserville, is one of three old-faithful geysers in the world, spouting about every 40 minutes.
Armstrong Redwoods State Preserve in Guerneville is just down the road from Korbel. It was still drizzly, but the rain had let up and we got to walk part of the 600 acres of coast redwoods. It was a peaceful stop after a lot of winery touring. Though cooler, the dense growth was reminiscent of the jungle growth of the Everglades.
The Luther Burbank Home and Gardens in Santa Rosa was the 1.6 acre inner-city site Burbank used as his laboratory during the 50 years he lived in Santa Rosa. It being January, the gardens were not startling in their beauty, and tours are offered only from May through October. But my wife is a landscaper and great gardener, so even in January she could see what it would be like in peak season. And throughout the gardens educational signs explain Burbank's outstanding plant-breeding experiments.
Sonoma State Historic Park includes northernmost of the Spanish missions in California and the home of General Vallejo, who ruled over California for Spain. Diagonally across the street from the mission is another beautiful urban park that, for some reason, had chickens strolling around the decorative fountain - and the puddles.
NAPA AND SONOMA INNS
Healdsburg Inn on the Plaza has only nine rooms - located upstairs over an art gallery - and is unsuitable for children under 5 because of the antiques. The breakfast was wonderful, with Belgian waffles, bagels, special-blend coffee, quiche and juices and more than we could eat. We enjoyed reading comments made by previous guests in our room and felt happy throughout.
Harvest Inn in St. Helena also offered us a good off-season rate of $99 compared to the lowest in-season rate of $130. Large rooms are spread out in separate cottages over 22 acres, and the gardens even in January were wonderful, including some great water gardens and many blooms. The breakfast room overlooked wineries and the hills, and the breakfast of juice, granola and bagels was good. They say the design is English Tudor style, but it feels a lot like a well maintained Maine lakefront cottage from early this century.
Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa was the fanciest of the inns we stayed at, and the most expensive at $135. There were signs of luxury everywhere, and the staff was ready to help, but the inn had an industrial feel. A lot of people come to take the natural hot waters. But the water we were most concerned with was from the occasional small leaks in the halls and our room. The carpet in our room was soggy near one window. Did I mention that it rained a bit?
DINING IN WINE COUNTRY
Tra Vigne Restaurant in St. Helena was top notch. (Nancy Grape, in the accompanying story, also enjoys it.) We had polenta with wild mushrooms, rabbit, pork and chicken sausage in a smoked corn and tomato sauce, flatbread with baked garlic and cheese. The wines were wonderful and purchased by-the-glass, including a very good Bonny Doon Muscat that went perfectly with the chocolate connoli. It was a great relaxing stop after flying out from Maine and driving north from San Francisco. The wine was especially welcome because we hadn't had a chance to stop at any wineries yet.
The Abbey Restaurant at the Freemark winery in St. Helena served a great lunch of lentil soup and steak sandwiches, perfect on a chilly damp day.The espresso machine was broken, but the regular coffee was outstanding.
The meal at Southside Saloon in Healdsburg was probably so welcome because the food was simple but tasty, the staff was friendly and the room was light and warm. I had the blue-plate special of chicken and dumplings, and Nancy had fried oysters, french fries, nouveau cole slaw and Healdsburg Pale Ale, made by a nearby brewery. Everything was cooked in a light, straightforward manner. The french fries, for example, were hand cut and lightly fried and dusted with rosemary.
The Cafe at the Sonoma Mission Inn and Spa served a pleasant but not outstanding meal of baby back ribs, grilled salmon, dirty rice, corn salsa with overkill desserts of rum-chocolate decadence and macaroon crunch sundae. The breakfast the next morning had a wonderfully light omelet with a variety of vegetables served with quarter cut home-fried potatoes and thickly sliced bacon.

The winery had the friendliest tasting room we visited. These vineyards east of St. Helena will not be damaged by being covered with water last year, as shown here, or by the much worse flooding this year. The Hop Kiln Winery just outside of downtown Healdsburg produces some of the finest wines we tasted. The form hop-drying barn is also a beautiful old building. p.4L Nancy Atwell photo The guide at Beringer Vineyards in St. Helena said this moss-covered tree was 100 years old. The grounds were as luscious as the wines.

Abstract: But even in a two-day trip, Golden Gate Park is worth one of the two days. We had taken a Gray Line tour of the city - at a cost of $26 each for my wife, Nancy, and me - on our first day. Last January Golden Gate Park was just recovering from a major windstorm that toppled trees, closed the arboretum and botanical gardens and severely damaged the Conservatory of Flowers. Repair work is continuing on the conservatory, but the rest of the park has reopened. Now the world's largest urban park, Golden Gate was started in the 1870s in an area of scrub oak and sand dunes by John McLaren, a Scottish born landscape gardener. McLaren oversaw the planting of more than a million trees there.

Full text: You can't do San Francisco justice in a two-day, three-night visit. You can just skim the surface and note some things to do on a return trip.
But even in a two-day trip, Golden Gate Park is worth one of the two days. We had taken a Gray Line tour of the city - at a cost of $26 each for my wife, Nancy, and me - on our first day.
Last January Golden Gate Park was just recovering from a major windstorm that toppled trees, closed the arboretum and botanical gardens and severely damaged the Conservatory of Flowers. Repair work is continuing on the conservatory, but the rest of the park has reopened.
Now the world's largest urban park, Golden Gate was started in the 1870s in an area of scrub oak and sand dunes by John McLaren, a Scottish born landscape gardener. McLaren oversaw the planting of more than a million trees there.
The park contains at least 6,000 varieties of plants and is filled with rhododendron dells, meadows, lakes, a golf course and other recreational facilities and several museums.
The Japanese Tea Garden is the park's most outstanding attraction, and we spent at least two hours there, walking among the elegant sculpted plants, waterfalls, ponds and bridges. Especially in January, the gardenis a mosaic of different shades and textures of green, providing a wonderfully restful feeling.
We studied the plants, trying to figure out which would grow in Maine, watched the waterfalls, gazed at the fish and stopped in at the gift shop.
Also in Golden Gate Park is the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, which includes a wide variety of art with an emphasis on American artists.
We were amazed by the number of Maine artists represented in this West Coast museum. Several works by Eastman Johnson of Lovell, known as "the American Rembrandt," were featured in a section of 19th century paintings.
We saw two sculptures by Franklin Simmons, one of Penelope and one of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman. Simmons is a Lewiston native who created the statue of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in Longfellow Square in Portland.
We saw Thomas Cole's "View of the White Mountains," which was painted in 1827.
The museum has the feeling of a well organized attic. We spent several hours there and didn't see everything. We felt it would take several trips to see most of what was there.
The museum includes a federal parlor from an 1805 house in Massachusetts, early American decorative arts, a section on the Arts and Crafts movement including Stickley furniture, and works by such absolute art giants as Gilbert Stuart, John Singer Sargent, Whistler and Gainsborough.
A visit to the Asian Art Museum, which is connected to the de Young Museum, was highlighted by a viewing of the oldest known Chinese Buddha. I especially enjoyed the extensive display of jade and porcelains.
Highlights of the bus tour included views of - and two trips over - the Golden Gate Bridge, views of the city from Twin Peaks, a stop at the Cliff House, a drive through Golden Gate Park with a short stop at the Japanese Tea Garden and stops at Mission Dolores and Fishermen's Wharf. The tour, on the top of a double-decker bus, gave us great views of the city and helped orient us for driving ourselves around later.
We especially enjoyed the gardens and cemetery at Mission Dolores, one of the 21 missions established by the Spanish in the late 1700s. The saucer magnolia and bird of paradise were just coming into bloom, though it was late January.
Fisherman's Wharf was a bunch of shops, though some of them were interesting. And while I might complain about the honky-tonk, tourist-trap atmosphere it all worked. We came and spent money.
Places to stay
The Carlton Hotel at 1075 Sutter St., spending $89 a night in off-season Januaryrates. The lobby has a fireplace and is filled with antiques, and the staff greeted us - often by name - as we came and went. Though it did not have a concierge, the staff provided directions and all the help we neeeded. The room was a tad small and, though our room was on the ninth floor, we occasionally heard shouts from the nursery school/day care center being run on a roof about four stories below us. But the room was comfortable and clean.
Each afternoon the hotel provided free wine for two hours.But even though this is the heart of wine country, the wine was a jug white.
The Westin St. Francis at 335 Powell St., in Union Square, was the site of the meeting my wife had to attend that made us decide to tour California in winter. Built in 1904, this is one of the grande dames of San Francisco. It survived the fires of the 1906 earthquake, but did suffer $1 million in damage. Guests have included nine presidents, royalty and other foreign leaders. Self-styled as an elegant hotel, it is lushly furnished. But the huge bouquets of artificial flowers in the lobby were low style.
Where to eat
Mayes, at 1233 Polk St., was a happy find. We were tired, having done some wineries in Sonoma, driven to Point Reyes and south to San Francisco. We wanted a relaxing place to eat within easy walking distance of our hotel, the Carlton.
Mayes is the second oldest restaurant in the city, though it has been in several locations since 1867, and features oysters as well as Italian fare. We had mahi mahi, good but not great, and delicious seafood linguini, which came with a choice of red or white sauce.
But the atmosphere was comfortable, with a good pianist unobtrusively playing music throughout the evening: definitely the quiet sophistication we expected in San Francisco.
John's Grill at 63 Ellis St. on Union Square is mentioned in Dashiell Hammett's "The Maltese Falcon" and was one of Hammett's hangouts. Established in 1908, it features a wide variety of historic pictures and antiques on its dark paneled walls.
We had crab cocktail and a mixture of feta and Greek olives for appetizers, fried oysters and lamplighter - a filet of sole stuffed with crab and shrimp - as the main course. The vegetable was sauteed carrots, summer squash and zucchini, and it was all wonderful.
We hesitated about going to John's. As Hammett fans we were loathe to see heavy commercialization of his name. But the connection was understated, and we were glad we took the chance.
Lou's was the restaurant our Gray Linebus driver, Jean-Pierre, recommended on Fishermen's Wharf for our mid-afternoon lunch. It was Saturday, so the upstairs bar was rocking with country and western music. It served a lot of seafood in a truck-stop style and relatively inexpensive prices. Its location right on the water gave us a "really native" feeling.

Steamed clams. Fried clams. Chowders and clam cakes. Stan Burnham remembers when he was 6 and the garlic and lemon odors of the delicious dishes filled his mother's kitchen, the reward for a family outing on Freeport's clam flats.
Burnham's memory is a common one of life on the Maine coast 30 years ago, when fertile clam flats provided family entertainment as well as consistent, if grueling, jobs for thousands of clammers.
These traditions have been threatened by pollution, strict federal regulations and state budget cuts that have forced the state to shut down thousands of acres of clam flats.
But an army of clam diggers, local shellfish wardens and environmentalists are battling to save the flats, and they are beginning to have success. In Freeport, Falmouth, Yarmouth and towns all up and down the coast, the state is reopening clam flats that have been closed for years.
"A lot of us felt for a while that we wouldn't have jobs," said Burnham, who is 36 and has worked as a clammer on and off since he was 15. "But now clamming has a good future."
In Freeport, state regulators are expected to open 170 acres of flats in the next couple of months. The openings would make 98 percent of Freeport's clam flats available for clamming, up from 35 percent in 1991. Yarmouth plans at the end of this month to offer its first commercial clamming licenses in a decade.
Throughout Maine, state officials reopened about 10,000 acres of clam flats in 1996.
Besides preserving Maine traditions, the openings save jobs. In 1995, 1,666 licensed clammers in Maine harvested about 150 million clams and sold them for more than $8 million.
The cleanup efforts also benefit wildlife and anyone who swims in Maine's waters or eats any kind of seafood, because they ensure the waters are clean.
"Keeping water safe for clams keeps it safe for everything, from lobsters to children swimming on the beach," said Mick McGivaren, Freeport's shellfish warden.
Fecal coliform has caused most of the clam-flat closures. The bacteria found in human and animal waste leaches into the tidal flats from sewage pipes, outdated septic system and farmer's fields. Eating clams contaminated with the bacteria makes people sick.
When coastal development in the 1980s increased the amount of pollution flowing into the flats, the federal Food and Drug Administration tightened clamming regulations, requiring lower pollution levels and more extensive clam-flat monitoring.
As a result, clamming was illegal by 1991 on nearly 20 percent of the state's clam flats, an area covering about 350,000 acres. The situation was even worse in heavily developed areas such as Casco Bay, where half the clam flats were shut down by 1993.
At the same time, budget cuts made it nearly impossible for the state to do the extensive pollution-source surveys and water testing necessary to reopen flats. The Department of Marine Resources has only six field operators to monitor the entire Maine coast.
"We were placed behind the eight ball," said Paul Anderson, director of the state'sshellfish sanitation program. "We needed help."
Help arrived in the form of town governments and local environmental groups launching extensive pollution cleanups and water monitoring efforts. Because of the local efforts, only about 13 percent of the state's clam flats remain closed, a figure the state hopes to get down to 10 percent by 2000.
One of the leading clam-flat restoration groups has been the Friends of Casco Bay, a nonprofit group established five years ago to improve and protect the bay's environment.
Krista Longnecker, the group's shellfish specialist, has spent the past two years marching through mud flats, fording icy streams and examining smelly sewage pipes in an attempt to reopen flats.
The work requires surveying all properties on the shore for potential pollution sources and taking hundreds of water samples, which are sent to a state laboratory in Boothbay Harbor.
Yarmouth, Falmouth flats
Longnecker's efforts are paying off. In the next couple of months the Department of Marine Resources will rule on opening 286 acres of clam flats in Yarmouth and Falmouth that she has surveyed with the help of about 30 volunteers.
Anderson said Longnecker's surveys look solid and there's a good chance that at least portions of the flats in each town will be reopened.
"We've been covering a lot of ground. It's nice now to finally see areas starting to open," Longnecker said. "It feels like two years of work is coming to fruition right now."
Longnecker's work willlet Yarmouth offer its first commercial clamming licenses in at least a decade. The town plans to hold a lottery for five licenses at the end of this month.
In past years, the town has issued only recreational licenses, which allow people to collect a limited amount of clams for personal consumption.
"We feel that we've made a comeback and have enough resources to offer both recreational and commercial licenses," said Jay Pinkham, chairman of the town's Shellfish Conservation Committee. "Perhapswe can increase the number of licenses over time. We'll just have to see what happens."
In Falmouth, where no flats have been open for any kind of clamming for about 10 years, the town has appointed a part-time shellfish warden and will develop a shellfishing ordinance this spring.
Police Chief Ed Tolan said the town plans to let people begin clamming next fall.
In Freeport, the effort to restore clam flats has been driven by town officials who recognized that the closures threatened an industry that has helped drive the local economy for generations.
The town launched a shellfish restoration program in 1991 and hired McGivaren to lead it. The program cost the town $18,000 last year, with McGivaren earning a salary of $12,000.
The cleanup has been aided by a $73,000 grant from the state that the town used to remove three overboard discharge systems - outdated sewage systems that served small group of homes and dumped contamination into Freeport's coves.
Walking the shoreline
McGivaren, a retired commercial airline pilot, spends many of his days walking Freeport's shoreline and taking water samples. Without his efforts, the state wouldn't have enough people to conduct the surveys needed to open Freeport's flats. With his efforts, nearly 100 percent of the town's flats are now open and will be monitored closely so that they stay open.
"There's a lot of hoops you have to jump through, but it is worth it and more towns should do it," McGivaren said. "Clamming is a valuable industry, but it's also a traditional industry, and that's what's great about it. You want to keep it alive."
Freeport has 60 licensed clammers who harvested $750,000 worth of clams in 1996. Their work is hard and has changed little over the years. For five hours at low tide, they bend over and rake the mud with a hoe that is about a foot long, has a wooden handle and four or five steel teeth.
On a good day, a clammer will fill his buckets with three bushels of clams. A bushel contains about 1,200 clams and sells for about $40 to $100, depending on the market.
Ken Goodenow is 58 and has been clamming in Freeport and Brunswick for much of his life. His father and uncles raked the flats, and one of his sons works as a clammer as well.
He said he's relieved to see the town's flats opening up, giving clammers the opportunity to spread out so they don't overharvest any particular area. He said clamming often makes him weary, but he doesn't plan to stop any time soon.
"I like the independence,"Goodenow said. "I'm not punching the clock for someone else. It's hard, but if you keep at it, you get by."

Edie Lau's recent series on the state of Norwegian fisheries was most enlightening for someone who is, like I am, largely ignorant of such matters.
Not only was her series of articles comprehensive and clearly presented, it was enhanced by wonderful photographs as well. As was the case with your Appalachian Trail report, we the readers again had a chance to vicariously be part of the action taking place in the story.
Edie Lau is a superb writer. I admire her ability to paint pictures with words and am sorry she will be leaving your paper and Maine.
Desiree Kinley
Cape Elizabeth
EDIE LAU has done a very fine job of combining excellent writing and documenting facts correctly in her "Return of the Cod" in Norway (Maine Sunday Telegram, Jan. 5)
Although I don't read your paper on a regular basis, I have noted that Edie has donea good job of exploring other conservation issues.
Unlike Americans, the Norwegians did what had to be done to bring back their cod fisheries. Plus the Norwegians adjusted lifestyles and employment to their benefit.
It seems American fishermen want to catch the last fish of whatever type (fin fish or shellfish) they are after and then go and rape another fisheries resource. The only exception seems to be the lobstermen who have their act together.
Whining and greed seem to be the American way of life, especially regarding fisheries.
It is time for fishermen, politicians and the public to bite the bullet and do what has to be done to save and enhance our fisheries for future generations.
Also, in the same issue of the Telegram, it was noted that dragging is destroying the bottom habitat for ground fish and other sea life ("Scouring away fishing's future: `Rock hoppers' devour what groundfish need to breed," by John Cole).
It appears that dragging should cease. Thank you.
Fred Hartman
Whiting
I THOUGHT John Cole's "disinformation" was interesting insofar as he quotes the Science News article as a way to further confuse (perhaps intentionally) the public.
I have towed my net on top of and around the Outer Falls, before rock hoppers. I can only say this: He is absolutely ignorant of the way that a bottom trawl works.
Rock hoppers, as their very name states, are meant to hop rocks. I doubt that the huge boulders that were moved around on the Outer Falls were done withrock hopper gear.
For one thing, when you catch a rock in a trawl you know it. Most of the time it stops you cold. Oh, you can tow it around if you like, perhaps snagging more rocks along the way. You will more than likely lose that tow because you will have a hole in your cod end. Does that make sense?
Also, the "catch-them-all-today-and-let-tomorrow-take-care-of-itself" mentality that he says that I am supposed to have as a commercial fisherman is a downright lie.
It is true that it is my aim to catch as many fish today as I can. It is not true that I seek to let tomorrow take care of itself.
As we go through the tortuous process of reshaping our industry for tomorrow, John Cole and those of his ilk are a perversion to the process, distorting facts and figures for their own end.
I hold these people in the most contempt for they know precious little about commercial fishing, but yet are given the high ground because they say they are "conservationists." I use the term loosely.

Abstract: Surging surf destroyed a town sea wall in Kennebunk and washed out parts of Beach Avenue. On Portland's busy waterfront, the rising sea covered the Portland Pier and cut off office workers from the mainland. Friday's high water was the result of bad timing. The Earth, moon and sun were lined up, creating a gravitational pull that was expected to cause an 11.6-foot high tide in Portland. Storm winds from the east and southeast pushed another foot of sea on the tide, lifting it to 12.6 feet before it turned at 11:30 a.m. Portland's mean high tide is 9.9 feet. In Kennebunk, water washed away a portion of the wooden sea wall and a sidewalk behind it at Gooch's Beach, and barricades were placed around sections of the road washed out by the surf. The wall, already weakened by previous storms, is scheduled to be replaced by Memorial Day using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Workers spent part of the day clearing debris from the road.

Full text: A storm-fed high tide overflowed roads, damaged sea walls and flooded basements along the coast of southern Maine on Friday.
Surging surf destroyed a town sea wall in Kennebunk and washed out parts of Beach Avenue. On Portland's busy waterfront, the rising sea covered the Portland Pier and cut off office workers from the mainland.
Friday's high water was the result of bad timing. The Earth, moon and sun were lined up, creating a gravitational pull that was expected to cause an 11.6-foot high tide in Portland. Storm winds from the east and southeast pushed another foot of sea on the tide, lifting it to 12.6 feet before it turned at 11:30 a.m. Portland's mean high tide is 9.9 feet.
In Kennebunk, water washed away a portion of the wooden sea wall and a sidewalk behind it at Gooch's Beach, and barricades were placed around sections of the road washed out by the surf. The wall, already weakened by previous storms, is scheduled to be replaced by Memorial Day using Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Workers spent part of the day clearing debris from the road.
At Camp Ellis in Saco, Seaside Avenue and parts of Main Avenue were under water at midday.
In Biddeford Pool, Mile Stretch Road was under nearly 2 feet of water by 11 a.m. The Biddeford Fire Department stationed a medic and fire truck there to reach residents who might otherwise be cut off from service.
The fire truck was used for a shuttle service when parents could not reach their children at a Biddeford Pool day-care center. The 13 children were treated to a ride on the truck, said Capt. Normand Melancon, as the crew drove them to a parking lot on Bridge Street where their parents waited.
In Cape Elizabeth, the tide covered Shore Road near Old Colony Lane, and Marsh Road near the Cape Elizabeth-Scarborough line was closed for several hours with 6 to 8 inches of water covering it, police said.
At Pine Point in Scarborough, the tide flooded basements of homes and rose up onto the parking lot and road at The Clam Bake restaurant, police said. Also, waves crashed against sea walls at Higgins Beach.
At Great Chebeague Island, part of the wharf for the ferries that run between Cousins Island and Chebeague was covered by more than a foot of water around 11 a.m. A rubber-booted ferry captain gallantly offered to carry arriving passengers through the water. He ended up driving them through it in his station wagon.
When a ferry departed at noon, the water was even higher. Passengers were taken to the ferry in a pickup truck. One passenger came prepared to cross on his own, wearing hip waders.
At the Portland Pier, parked cars sat in several feet of water. Office buildings and J's Oyster Bar, just a short block from Commercial Street, were surrounded by sea. A couple of feet of water flooded the basement of an office building on Commercial Street.
"The carpet is squishy," said Mark Randall, a lawyer whose office on the pier was surrounded by ocean for a few hours before the tide fell. While firefighters and the curious watched from dry land, workers in the law offices and other buildings on the pier watched the tide from balconies.
"I didn't really realize we were going to have this high tide," said Portland Deputy Fire Chief Richard Curran. The fire department found out when the surging tide triggered an alarm at a building on the Portland Pier at 10:41 a.m., he said.
The department stationed its fire boat next to the pier and firefighters at the water's edge in case the flooding threatened the buildings or occupants.
The only person evacuated was Karen Morgan, a lawyer, who had to get to a deposition at noon. Coast Guardsmen in a skiff took her from the back door of Daniel G. Lilley's law offices to dry land.
"Thanks for the lift," Morgan said as she took off an orange life vest and picked up her brown leather briefcase. "Have a nice day."
Because its first floor is higher than the pier, only a few inches of water flowed into a hallway in Lilley's offices, Randall said. The hardest part was waiting for the tide to ebb. "It was a little difficult to use the facilities with the water at that level," he said.
Utility workers stood by to cut off electricity and gas service if necessary, but both stayed on through the high tide. Power was shut off to 136 Commercial St. to pump out about 2 feet of water from its basement.
That building's owner, Steve McDuffie, said the pier floods every few years or so and that storm tides have even overflowed onto Commercial Street. He didn't expect a lot of damage, he said.
"Most of the buildings down here, you think about it when you set it up," McDuffie said.
J's Oyster Bar has seen rising tides, and while it put a crimp in lunchtime business, being surrounded by water didn't force any adjustments, said one employee, Lisa Reynolds. "We were open the whole time," she said, "but nobody could get in."

WALDOBORO GETS FUNDS TO BUILD SEWAGE PLANT THE CURRENT PLANT DISCHARGES WASTE INTO THE MEDOMAK RIVER, KEEPING PRIME CLAMMING AREAS CLOSED.

Abstract: The Waldoboro Utility District will receive $5.2 million in grants and a loan to build a wastewater treatment plant inland from the Medomak River, opening more flats to shellfish harvesting. The current plant, built in 1968, discharges 120,000 gallons of treated wastewatera day into the river. The new facility, a lagoon-type plant scheduled to go on line by the end of 1999, will spray treated wastewater on 50 acres of land instead. A $3.2 million grant, available through the Department of Environmental Protection, is coming from an $8 million wastewater treatment bond approved by voters last November. Waldoboro's portion is high because its median household income, $17,083 per year, is so low, according to DEP engineer Dennis Purington.

Full text:   The Waldoboro Utility District will receive $5.2 million in grants and a loan to build a wastewater treatment plant inland from the Medomak River, opening more flats to shellfish harvesting.
"We're elated," said Superintendent John Fancy. "This is the culmination of several years of planning. One of our major goals, to improve the quality of the water, will be fulfilled."
Before the project goes through, legislators must authorize a change in the town's charter to raise its debt limit. Residents will vote on the new plant in June.
The current plant, built in 1968, discharges 120,000 gallons of treated wastewatera day into the river. The new facility, a lagoon-type plant scheduled to go on line by the end of 1999, will spray treated wastewater on 50 acres of land instead.
A $3.2 million grant, available through the Department of Environmental Protection, is coming from an $8 million wastewater treatment bond approved by voters last November. Waldoboro's portion is high because its median household income, $17,083 per year, is so low, according to DEP engineer Dennis Purington.
"We try to keep what sewer users pay at 2 percent of the median household income," he said.
Another $1 million grant, plus a $1 million loan, is coming from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program (formerly the Farmers Home Administration) in Bangor.
According to Fancy, there is no town tax money involved in the project, and only those who are hooked up to the public sewer, about 2,000 households, will pay for it. Sewer user fees, averaging $330 per year, will not go up because of the project, he said.
The Medomak River, which runs from upper Waldoboro to Friendship before emptying into Muscongus Bay, is considered one of the best clamming areas in Maine. In 1996, 248 seasonal and part-time licenses were issued, with an annual harvest valued at up to $2 million, according to Waldoboro Town Manager Lee Smith.
In recent years, towns along the Medomak have made progress improving the water quality by upgrading septic systems and eliminating licensed discharges. Today, the only permanently closed portion extends from the treatment plant downriver for two to three miles. "It will be good to get the plant out of the river and into a different location," said Smith.
Dirigo Engineering of Waterville will design the new plant, at a cost of $165,000. The two pump stations, pressurized main pipe and 25-acre lagoon will run an estimated $3.8 million.

BAGGING UP MAINE'S NATURAL STUFF AN ENTREPRENEUR IS MAKING A SOIL ENRICHER OUT OF FISH AND SHELLFISH BYPRODUCTS, BLUEBERRY TWIGS, AND EVEN GRANITE DUST

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]06 Jan 1997: 1.C.

Abstract: Legend has it that Squanto taught the Pilgrims to till fish into their gardens to enrich the soil. Regardless of whether that tale is true, generations of Maine coast gardeners have nourished their soil by mixing in composted fish, shellfish and seaweed. Last year, Coast of Maine products in Portland introduced a bagged mixture derived from ingredients such as Atlantic salmon, herring and blue mussels.

"Maine has notoriously poor soil, as does most of the coast," said Carl Quijano, Coast of Maine president.

Legend has it that Squanto taught the Pilgrims to till fish into their gardens to enrich the soil. Regardless of whether that tale is true, generations of Maine coast gardeners have nourished their soil by mixing in composted fish, shellfish and seaweed.
More recently, professional gardeners and landscapers have started experimenting withcompost from marine byproducts.
Last year, Coast of Maine products in Portland introduced a bagged mixture derived from ingredients such as Atlantic salmon, herring and blue mussels. The compost is designed to supplement soil, which in coastal Maine and tends to be highly acidic.
"Maine has notoriously poor soil, as does most of the coast," said Carl Quijano, Coast of Maine president.
Several ingredients are byproduct's of Maine's growing aquaculture industry. Part of Quijano's intention is to offer a recycling alternative for Maine's fish, shellfish and wild blueberry processors.
"Waste is a problem for them," Quijano said. "Ten years ago, everyone dumped it back into the sea, but that's not an option anymore."
The fish add nutrients and nitrogen to the soil, while the mussels are a natural source of calcium, which tempers acidic soil. Other materials include wild blueberry bush leaves and twigs for fiber and peat moss, harvested from Maine's marshes and bogs, for absorbency. Mixed together, aerated and allowed to molder, the result is a dark, rich, odorless compost.
The recipe sounds almost good enough to eat. "It sounds like the buffet at an expensive restaurant," Quijano said.
The potting soil ingredients, however - including kelp meal from Waldoboro and pink granite dust (for drainage) from a quarry on Mount Desert Island - sound less palatable.
While winter has scarcely arrived, avid gardeners start planning their patches well before mud season. Coast of Maine products are available in garden centers around Maine, but Quijano said the biggest market has been in Boston and throughout Connecticut.
"They all want the cachet of using something made from coast of Maine resources," Quijano said.

Abstract: With the recent court decision in Hawaii concerning same-sex marriages, I fear some of my colleagues in the clergy and other people of faith will once again be bringing out the Christian Bible to "prove" that homosexuality is a sin against God. Many will feel convinced when they hear the authority of Scripture and the power of the pulpit decrying homosexuals as sinners. To those who don't know what to believe I would lift up Luke 12:57, "Why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?" Ask them if they think adulterers should be put to death as commanded in Leviticus 20:10. Ask them if they realize that nowhere in the four Gospels is Jesus recorded as saying anything about homosexuality, while he is recorded in two of them as saying clearly, "Judge not, so that you may not be judged" (Matthew 7:1-2; Luke 6:37-38).

Full text: Using Scripture as a reference point
With the recent court decision in Hawaii concerning same-sex marriages, I fear some of my colleagues in the clergy and other people of faith will once again be bringing out the Christian Bible to "prove" that homosexuality is a sin against God.
Many will feel convinced when they hear the authority of Scripture and the power of the pulpit decrying homosexuals as sinners. To those who don't know what to believe I would lift up Luke 12:57, "Why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?"
Ask those who condemn homosexuality if they eat pork or shellfish, have a tattoo or wear clothing made of a blend of fibers, all of which are condemned in the book of Leviticus (5:7-13; 19:28; 19:19).
Ask them if they think adulterers should be put to death as commanded in Leviticus 20:10. Ask them if they realize that nowhere in the four Gospels is Jesus recorded as saying anything about homosexuality, while he is recorded in two of them as saying clearly, "Judge not, so that you may not be judged" (Matthew 7:1-2; Luke 6:37-38).
Interracial love was once considered immoral, but we've come to understand that what really matters is the quality of the love, not the skin colors of the people involved.
Perhaps one day we will also know that the genders of a couple are far less important than the love they share.

I AM A "dropout" - a dropout from church. But I do believe all that was instilled in me in my learning years.
I feel that God Almighty's hand must be getting heavier as the centuries pass. The Holy Bible tells us humans how to live and prepare for eternity. Sodomy is mentioned in that great book.
Now this great government under which we live is accepting "same-sex" marriages! Who will be the one to have to stand before his "maker" and try to explain the "why" of it?
Is it possible to exist 50/50? Half good and half bad? How may civilized nations will condone such a thing? I say, "Shame," because it is disgusting and "godless."

Royko column poisons, ridicules serious issues
I am disappointed that the Portland Press Herald published Mike Royko's column of Dec. 9.
In addition to the homophobic arrogance we have become accustomed to from Royko, that day's column makes light of domestic violence and divorce, all in the guise of being a satire on the issue of same-sex marriage.
All too often the Press Herald is in the situation of publishing news articles of tremendous pain and even death due to domestic violence in our society. What possible rationalization is there then for publishing Royko's column making light of spousal abuse? The editors at The Portland Newspapers are notignorant on these issues. Where are your heads and hearts?
Let's be clear on this: Domestic violence and spousal abuse kill people and destroy the fabric of family values. These violent acts with such destructive outcomes should not be smugly used as tools in a satire.
The Portland Press Herald has a duty to its readers to provide content that is balanced and thought-provoking. The subject of same-sex marriage is controversial in our society today and needs to be presented in ways which allow your readers to see many viewpoints. Certainly there is room for satire on this issue.
However, by publishing the Royko column with its implicit hatred of gay men and lesbians, the Portland Press Herald not only poisons the atmosphere of discussion on the subject of same-sex marriage but ridicules the pain for those of us affected by domestic violence and spousal abuse.

Proposed CPI changes common-sense reform
I found your editorial in the Dec. 5 Press Herald onthe proposed changes to the Consumer Price Index to be amazingly short-sighted ("Motives are wrong for changing CPI").
While you warn against "messing with the CPI for political reasons," I call the proposed changes common-sense reform.
The CPI is supposed to be an accurate gauge of inflation. If it doesn't accurately gauge inflation, then the formula that makes up the CPI should be changed. (Fair is fair.)
The American Association of Retired Persons attacked the report as a back-door effort to cut Social Security benefits. I support the proposed changes despite the higher taxes that I would have to pay with the revamped CPI and despite the fact that (unlike current retirees) under current law, I won't be able to retire with full benefits until I am at least 67 (a move toward the government living within its means; no pain, no gain).
Mike O'Neill
Raymond
THE RECENT DEBATE over the use of the Consumer Price Index again shows that the economics profession plays the role of the clergy for our corporate aristocracy, preaching austerity instead of religion for people other than their employers.
In this effort, they conveniently forgot the reason the CPI was invented in the first place.
The CPI was begun by the government in previous decades to measure the cost of goods and services purchased by urban wage earners and clerical workers so that the wages of defense industry workers could be automatically adjusted upward to avoid labor unrest in those industries.
The index was directed at those whose wages were being adjusted. If we were to follow that precedent today, we would adjust Social Security by the cost of goods and services purchased by the elderly.
Does anyone doubt that due to high medical purchases which rise quickly in cost, the CPI for the elderly is rising faster than the overall CPI?
A fair way to reform Social Security would be to means-test the benefits based on income level, not just wages up to about $65,000.
The Boskin Commission and its supportersin the media would rather preach sacrifice to the elderly so that corporations and investors can receive greater financial returns. However, we may find out that Social Security recipients will not accept unfair "reforms."

Ambulance fee of $800 seems rather excessive
I want to write about the biggest rip-off of the country.
It has to do with the charges of private ambulance companies.
I live in a group home in Gray. We have Veterans Administration and state patients here. Last week an ambulance came to take a patient to Togus. He was acting up. They also send patients back for fighting.
For that 50-mile ride, the ambulance company charges almost $800. I asked the ambulance worker how much he was paid. He said $10 an hour. He also said that private ambulance companies are owned by the hospitals.
Their actual costs of the trips can't be more than $75 or $80. If this isn't a rip-off I don't know what it is. Who regulates the fees?

SEWAGE-PIPE LEAK IN SCARBOROUGH HALTS CLAM DIGGING THE LEAK IS FIXED, BUT THE FLATS REMAIN CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

Abstract: "Fecal coliform from raw sewage will contaminate the shellfish, and if they get to market, they'll make people sick," said Laura Livingston, a water-quality specialist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The sewage stopped flowing about 3 p.m. Thursday, but it will take at least two tide cycles to cleanse the river.

Full text: Workers have fixed a leak that sent 350,000 gallons of raw sewage into the Nonesuch River over three days, closing the town's clamflats.
Clamflats in the town remain closed, however, and will stay that way for several days.
"Fecal coliform from raw sewage will contaminate the shellfish, and if they get to market, they'll make people sick," said Laura Livingston, a water-quality specialist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources.
The sewage stopped flowing about 3 p.m. Thursday, but it will take at least two tide cycles to cleanse the river. State scientistswill then need two days to test water samples before they open the flats.
The problem began Tuesday morning, when a pressurized sewer pipe at a pump station on Route 114 just north of the river broke, said Michael Farmer, the superintendent of the Scarborough Sanitary District, which owns the station.
"We don't know (why or how the pipe broke)," Farmer said. "The location is approximately 30 feet below ground and we are going to have to excavate it and investigate to really figure out the exact cause."
On Thursday, workers bypassed the pipe - a temporary fix.
Farmer said he doesn't know how long it will take to permanently repair the 12-inch pipe, or how much the repairs will cost.
"This probably happened at the worst time for us," Farmer said. "It's difficult to get anything fixed over Christmas because your material suppliers and contractors are out on holidays."
It's a bad time for clam diggers as well.
"We were planning on going digging on (Christmas Eve)," said Tim Downs, a commercial clam digger whose automobile license tag reads DIGGER 1. "We were going to get some clams and give them to relatives for Christmas."
Downs, who has been digging for clams about 25 years, since he was 6 years old, said he and his wife, also a clam digger, are bracing themselves for two weeks without work.
"It's kind of a bad time, right around Christmas," he said.
David Corbeau, Scarborough's marine resource officer, said other clam diggers have similar thoughts.
"You've got 15 or so guys that are going out there every day right now," he said. "They're waiting for me to open the clamflats back up."
But it's not Corbeau's decision, and until the state Department of Marine Resources deems the water safe, clammers calling Corbeau will hear this message on his voicemail: "Keep in mind: Everything in the town of Scarborough is now closed to clam digging."
The flats were last closed in October, after record-breaking rain proved pipe-breaking as well. Clamming wassuspended for more than a week after that storm.
December generally is reasonably unproductive for clam diggers, but this month's mild temperatures had Scarborough's 30 licensed commercial diggers optimistic.
"We just opened up a new area, which made it a lot better for them, so they had been digging that," Corbeau said.
Livingston, of the Department of Marine Resources, said there are 16 water-monitoring stations along the river, and that all 16 must be designated clean before flats are reopened.

Full text: Paul Greenberg is editorial page editor of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in Little Rock.
It's quite a reversal, leaving foggy, drizzly Little Rock early on a frosty morn and arriving in Boston on a golden afternoon. Welcome to the sunny North.
I came to talk about writing with the New England Society of Newspaper Editors.
The company is good, but the scenery is even better. Which is why I took a few days off in Maine.
One travels not only to see how others live, and hear how they talk, and note how they act, and sample what they eat (clam chowder, stuffed crab, lobster bisque) but also to explore one's own reactions: curiosity, bewilderment, admiration, distaste, enjoyment, insight . . . .
There's no education like being set down in a different part of the world. Humility teaches; it's success that's ruinous. The fortunate traveler will discover his inmost self - and extend it.
To sit in a cafe on the Main Street in Rockland, or in Moody's Diner on Route 1 in Waldoboro, and savor the accents. is to be struck again by the natural diversity of this continent-nation.
The more distinctive the accent, the better - and few American voices are more distinctive than Maine's. It's Massachusetts without the brash urban clang, and slowed down to 45 RPM. Ayup.
New England's essence
How summarize Maine, if that's possible? It's New England's New England. The way Mississippi is the South's South.
What's your idea of the perfect seafood restaurant? Try to imagine one. Here are a few suggestions:
It should be on a small, snug harbor. From your windowside table, you should be able to watch sailors scrape barnacles off hulls and move seacraft to dry dock.
Theplace should have lots of wood, including some in the fireplace, which should glow with a crackling, well-built fire.
You should arrive in time for lunch on a blue-gray day that accents the greens in the countryside, and watch the light turn from slate to mellow. Or maybe on a drizzly New England night that calls for turtlenecks and tweed.
There should be tall candles on the tables in hurricane glasses, the flames reflected in the polished wooden surfaces.
You should be able to nibble on grainycrackers and sharp cheddar till the grog arrives.
You should have a pleasant but unobtrusive waitress who, hearing Southern voices speculate about the difference in textures and tastes between oysters, mussels and clams, brings over a steaming sampling of all of them to satisfy our curiosity.
The menu should be varied but mostly marine, and you should be with friends. And not in a hurry.
Of course such a place is the ideal, not real - unless you're in the vicinity of Rockport, Maine.
Then you can call (207) 236-2330 for reservations at the Sail Loft restaurant. Seldom has what M.F.K. Fisher called "the dark necessity of eating" been so bright.
To travel is to put everydayness behind you. It will still exist for the locals - the museum docent and the clerk in the convenience store, the real estate people making a deal at the next table.
Hopper and Wyeth
Driving through Rockland and Rockport, past Kittery and Ogunquit, the tourist is surprised at how familiar it looks, and feels. Then one realizes why.
Two of the most American painters of the century have made it familiar. Edward Hopper summered year after year not far from the Farnsworth Museum in Rockland that now shows his work; Andrew Wyeth lived around the bend in Cushing.
And what Wyeth did for the American countryside (Christina's World, Her Room) Hopper did for the American city (Nighthawks, Hotel Lobby). Hopper, who studied in Paris, once said it took him 10 years to get Europe out of his system and begin to paintAmerica as it is.
The highways lead to to scenic views, to Bald Head Cliff and Owl's Head lighthouse, but Wyeth and Hopper knew that America is not in amber waves of grain and purple mountains' majesty, or in the whitecaps off Bar Harbor or the mansions at Newport.
The still mythic America lies in the longing they captured and reflected on their strangely empty canvases. a longing for a past now unrecapturable, or a future still unencountered. A longing for the beauty that is not so much articulated in their paintings as anticipated. It is the poignant emptiness of American spaces they painted, the loneliness waiting to be filled.
It would be a New England poet, Robert Frost, in "The Gift Outright," who understood that the land was ours before we were the land's. We don't quite belong to it even now; we are still trying to come to terms with its grace.
All around, the bleak beauty cries out to be explored, exciting that most irrepressibly American of instincts: to go forth, to take ourselves to a land that will be shown us, to find ourselves at last. Then we will fill in the blank spaces with their true names, and know our own at last.

Abstract: For years, a Portland mother has tried to distract her children from noticing how little she can give them on Christmas morning. Christmas brings joy to many homes, but to some it brings apprehension. For this family, like many fighting health problems and financial trouble, the holiday can be a difficult time when children's wishes stretch beyond parents' capacity to give. Many families across southern Maine - such as this woman and her two sons - manage to fulfill their Christmas dreams through the Bruce Roberts Santa Fund, which since 1949 has used charitable donations to buy toys for families in need.

Full text: For years, a Portland mother has tried to distract her children from noticing how little she can give them on Christmas morning.
"Small presents in big boxes," she said. "Everyone who doesn't have much knows that."
Christmas brings joy to many homes, but to some it brings apprehension. For this family, like many fighting health problems and financial trouble, the holiday can be a difficult time when children's wishes stretch beyond parents' capacity to give.
Many families across southern Maine - such as this woman and her two sons - manage to fulfill their Christmas dreams through the Bruce Roberts Santa Fund, which since 1949 has used charitable donations to buy toys for families in need.
Lastyear, donations exceeded $191,000, brightening Christmas for more than 8,400 children.
This is the second time the 48-year-old Portland mother has turned to the fund for help. Afflicted with seizures that have forced her to give up working, she relies mostly on food stamps, Medicaid and $480 in monthly Social Security.
Taking a handout never gets easy, the woman said, but after a look at this year's money troubles she felt she had to come to Bruce Roberts - for the sake of her children.
What little she might have had for Christmas presents must go elsewhere - to heating oil for a house that is always too cold, and to clothes for the boys, who at ages 12 and 14 no longer fit into last year's shirts and pants.
This year, higher oil prices have been a particular drain on the fragile family budget as bills of more than $200 a month have become routine - even in this winter's relatively warm weather.
"The people upstairs don't run their heat and it makes it colder for us," she said. "And I need to run it for my sons."
Her boys are good children, she said. They get good grades, stay out of trouble, and this year tended to her as she recovered from a stroke.
"They just worry about Mom being sick," she said. "I want them to think about Christmas."
The Bruce Roberts fund has eased their cares this season, she said, by providing gifts for the boys.
The house is fully festive - decorated with a paper Santa Claus and other drawings made by the children years earlier, and still admired by a sentimental mother who would never think of throwing away their handiwork.
In the living room, the center of it all, an artificial tree stands with big boxes beneath it.
"The boxes are big," she said. "This year, I know they'll like what's inside."

Abstract: Southern Maine began drying out in the sunshine Wednesday as roads gradually were made passable and water service was restored to virtually all of Greater Portland. Water service was restored Wednesday to virtually all of the 140,000 customers of the Portland Water District who lost pressure or service when raging floodwaters broke four water mains Tuesday. Businesses throughout the region reopened during the day Wednesday, with many bringing in drinking water for workers. One exception was the S.D. Warren paper mill in Westbrook, which remained closed as crews worked to clean equipment.

Full text: This section was sold only as an over-the-counter separate special section. It became available for purchase on Monday, December 16, 1996. It contains many photographs not published with the original coverage of the flood, as well as new stories, captions, and re-edited versions of already published news stories.
Southern Maine began drying out in the sunshine Wednesday as roads gradually were made passable and water service was restored to virtually all of Greater Portland.
Searchers pulled the body of a Scarborough man from a swollen brook into which he had been swept Monday night. Robert Snow, 42, was the storm's sole fatality in Maine.
The region's cleanup began in earnest Wednesday, two days after Maine was inundated by its biggest rainstorm in history.
In Old Orchard Beach, residents returned to their homes and piled soaked belongings in front yards to dry. "People are happy we didn't have in our community any major injuries," said Mike Nugent, the town's code enforcement officer.
In Westbrook, where the flooded Presumpscot River had receded, Dennis and Lucy Cobb pumped 4 1/2 feet of water out of their basement and were busy disinfecting the floor. "My daughter's room was down here, so she lost her bed," said Dennis Cobb.
State and federal officials spent the day trying to come up with damage assessments. The figure is expected to exceed the conservative initial estimates of $10 million.
Teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency began inspecting the damage and meeting with local officials. Gov. Angus King formally asked President Clinton to declare Cumberland and York counties disaster areas, and said other areas could be added.
"I have determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments and that supplementary federal assistance is necessary," King said in a letter to Clinton.
Water service was restored Wednesday to virtually all of the 140,000 customers of the Portland Water District who lost pressure or service when raging floodwaters broke four water mains Tuesday.
Water officials also began testing for bacteria in the water supply and said they hope the results will allow them to lift a boil-water order by noon Thursday.
Businesses throughout the region reopened during the day Wednesday, with many bringing in drinking water for workers. One exception was the S.D. Warren paper mill in Westbrook, which remained closed as crews worked to clean equipment.
Downtown Portland, a soggy ghost town on Tuesday, appeared virtually back to normal by Wednesday afternoon - except for the flow of people to the Central Fire Station for free drinking water.
Schoolchildren remained home Wednesday, but most schools were set to reopen Thursday as roads dried out and toilets flushed. School officials said they planned to bring in drinking water for students.
Westbrook schools will remain closed, however, because of washed-out roads and bridges.
State and town officials put hundreds of repair crews to work patching and fixing key routes to alleviate commuter headaches caused by the storm damage.
A section of the Maine Turnpike near Exit 6 in Scarborough was opened to one lane of traffic Wednesday.
Although the northbound turnpike remained closed between Exits 7 and 8, crews were rebuilding the roadbed Wednesday.
Around southern Maine, scattered local roads and bridges remained closed while crews continued repairs. Traffic on the turnpike and on local roads also may be reduced to one lane at times while road crews repair shoulders, replace guardrails and pave sections that have been partially repaired.
Mainers on Wednesday were still shocked by the amount of water that fell between Sunday morning and Tuesday morning. The storm dumped 19 inches on Camp Ellis in Saco and 13.5 inchesin Portland. No storm in history here had ever come close to those totals.
Casualty confirmed
The storm's only known casualty was confirmed Wednesday.
Volunteers in Scarborough found the body of Snow, who drowned after the truck he was driving Monday night plunged off a washed-out portion of Old Blue Point Road into Stuart Brook.
His wife, Cindy, was riding in the truck when it crashed but was able to swim to shore and call for help.
Snow's body was found by a friend about 8 a.m. Wednesday amid tall grass about 200 yards downstream from where his white pickup truck lodged in the middle of the brook.
Snow probably sank to the bottom Monday night and was found as the water level in the brook dropped, said Scarborough police Sgt. Angelo Mazzone.
Mazzone said he is still unsure what led Snow to try to cross the washed-out road at 9 p.m. Monday, during the height of the storm that dropped more than 15 inches of rain on Scarborough. Snow appeared to be trying to use a back road to avoid Pine Point Road through the Scarborough Marsh, which was underwater.
Cindy Snow told police that there were no barricades on the road as she and her husband approached the washed-out span on Old Blue Point Road, though orange and white sawhorses were set up at 6:30 p.m. and were still in place at 8 p.m., Mazzone said.
One troublesome possibility, Mazzone said, is that another motorist moved the barricades, something emergency workers contended with throughout the worst of the storm.
"People were moving the barricades all night and nobody puts them back," Mazzone said. The Snows "could have fallen victim to somebody else moving them."
Damage figures rise
The Route 302 bridge in Westbrook, which Tuesday was under 6 feet of water, reopened to traffic shortly before noon Wednesday.
Westbrook officials upgraded their damage estimates to $1.5 million, prompting an emergency meeting of the City Council to discuss the repairs needed.
Councilors approved Mayor Kenneth Lefebvre's request to begin borrowing money so the city could hire contractors to fix the damaged roads and bridges.
"We just need to forget about bidding emergency bridge repairs," Lefebvre said. "We need to get available contractors on a timely basis to get this work taken care of."
Inspectors from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Small Business Administration assessed damage Wednesday.
"The teams began this morning doing preliminary damage assessments to determine the damage," said Ed Wojnas, chief spokesman for FEMA. "They walk and inspect and look, along with a local official."
The inspections are done to verify that the area qualifies for federal relief. Homeowners and businesses would be eligible for low-interest loans if the area qualifies, Wojnas said.
Grants are available only to homeowners who have lost the use of their homes. They can receive one-time grants to pay three months of rent while their houses are repaired.
Still without water
The only Portland Water District customers without water Wednesday evening were residents of 10 homes on outer Broadway in South Portland.
The district needs to connect the neighborhood to another main because they normally draw water from the section of pipe that broke early Tuesday.
Four water pipe breaks were found and sealed off Tuesday. In addition, a 6-inch pipe at Bridge Street in Westbrook broke apart at about 4 a.m. Wednesday, apparently because of the rapid return of pressure in the system. It was quickly sealed off and repaired to restore service to 12 homes.
Also Wednesday, the district installed a temporary water line around a leak near Pope Road in Windham to restore water service to about 14 customers.
Water District crews, aided by receding flood waters, also staunched much of the raw sewage flowing into local rivers and Casco Bay since Monday.
State officials closed shellfish flats from Portland to New Hampshire on Tuesday as millions of gallons of sewage overflowed pipes and treatment plants that were overwhelmed by storm runoff.
Overflows of combined sewage from valves scattered around Casco Bay tapered off as the flow of water into sewers became more manageable.
The Water District crews repaired one of two flooded pump stations that were leaking sewage.
The Stroudwater Pump Station off Blueberry Road in Portland was once again sending sewage toward the treatment plant, instead of into the Stroudwater River. "They have got that pump station temporarily rigged to pump sewage," said Daniel Jellis, general manager of the district.

Abstract: A record-breaking storm pummeled York County and southern Maine with more than a foot of rain Monday, packing wind gusts up to 40 mph, flooding rivers, washing out roads, causing dozens of accidents and stranding scores of people. A storm-high 19inches soaked Camp Ellis, flooding roads. Hardest-hit was Old Orchard Beach's Ocean Park neighborhood, where emergency crews in motorboats rescued more than 40 residents stranded by 4 feet of water lapping at their doors. Sixteen emergency shelters were set up in Biddeford, Saco, Old Orchard Beach, Wells and in Cumberland County. Schools closed early and businesses shut down in a reaction more common for heavy snowfall than a hard rain.

A record-breaking storm pummeled York County and southern Maine with more than a foot of rain Monday, packing wind gusts up to 40 mph, flooding rivers, washing out roads, causing dozens of accidents and stranding scores of people.
A storm-high 19inches soaked Camp Ellis, flooding roads. Hardest-hit was Old Orchard Beach's Ocean Park neighborhood, where emergency crews in motorboats rescued more than 40 residents stranded by 4 feet of water lapping at their doors.
Sixteen emergency shelters were set up in Biddeford, Saco, Old Orchard Beach, Wells and in Cumberland County. Schools closed early and businesses shut down in a reaction more common for heavy snowfall than a hard rain.
The National Guard was called out because roads were sobad that heavy trucks were needed to take to shelters some residents of Scarborough and Westbrook trapped by the rising waters Monday night.
Gov. Angus King declared a state of emergency in York, Cumberland and Oxford counties.
Relief officials said Old Orchard Beach suffered the worst of the flooding. Most major and minor roads in and out of town were blocked by as much as 4 feet of water.
The town "is literally isolated," said Bob Bohlmann, director of the Emergency Management Agency in York County.
Ocean Park's central square was one large pool of water with a stretch of West Grand Avenue underwater, as were parts of East Grand Avenue and much of First Street.
"Last winter was our first winter here. We said it couldn't get any worse," said Helen Vassill of West Grand Avenue in Old Orchard Beach as she and her husband, Jim, rolled up their wet pant legs in the shelter at the Loranger Middle School.
"At 8 a.m., it wasn't that bad," Helen Vassill said. "From 8 to 9, it came up so fast. It was going in the cellar window like a waterfall."
The Vassills, along with many others, were evacuated by motorized rubber boat and taken by ambulance to a shelter.
Traffic was backed up for miles along the Maine Turnpike. Water streamed across the interstate in Kittery and across the turnpike in Biddeford and Scarborough, leading to backups that were up to six miles long.
The turnpike was closed Monday night between Saco and New Gloucester because of washouts and water on the road.
Saco's Camp Ellis received the most rainfall in southern Maine, but it appeared to escape the serious damage often caused by storms.
Although a small stretch of Eastern Avenue was washed away, none of the homes that are often threatened by erosion from strong storms seemed in danger at high tide Monday night, said Sandra Bastille, a Camp Ellis resident.
Dozens of cars spilled off flooded roads Monday, and police reported numerous small accidents and cars stalling in roadways covered with water.
Ann Mack of Old Orchard Beach said she didn't understand what all the fuss was about until she tried to drive to Portland late Monday morning. She had to turn back when she found Route 1 north closed and then drove into deep water on Walnut Street.
"The car started to float," Mack said. "With all my might, I pushed the door open to get out." After she waded through water more than waist deep, a man in a car behind Mack's took her to the shelter at Loranger Middle School.
Heavy rains causedproblems throughout the region:
In Westbrook at 10 p.m. Monday, police were trying to rescue an unidentified man from the Presumpscot River, behind 77 Bridgton Road. The man reportedly had been struggling in the river for more than an hour.
Police Chief Steven Roberts said the man may have passed a roadblock on Route 302, at the bridge where it crosses the river. Witnesses on the Portland side of the river said they saw the taillights to the man's truck go into the water and disappear.
In York,Railroad Avenue in the town square at York Beach was covered in some places by several feet of water, leaving only the tops of fire hydrants visible. Cars were stalled in water to the bumpers. Stores - even the few in that beach town that stay open through the winter - were closed.
The water was licking at the doors of Garfield's newsstand and the York Beach Fish Market in the beach square.
York Fire Chief William Foster stayed in contact with the Red Cross to make sure that those wishing to evacuate their homes would get help from police or firefighters. He said most of the homes that were flooded were unoccupied summer cottages.
In Wells, a leaking roof at the high school forced an early closing, but part of the school was kept open for people seeking shelter from flooded houses.
Wells Town Manager Jonathan Carter said the Tatnic Road overpass, which was under construction, was flooded and the entire road was shut down. He said a house at the end of Drake Island was suffering the worst flooding and that the owner was given permission by town officials to shore up a seawall to prevent further erosion.
Biddeford Police Chief Roger Beaupre said some of the worst flooding occurred at the Exit 4 entrance to the Maine Turnpike at Route 111. Parts of Route 111 near the Arundel line were closed by water over the road.
"People are calling wondering how to get home, and we're doing the best we can to give them directions," Beaupre said.
On West Street in Biddeford, Wilcox Pond overflowedits banks and covered part of the road. Motorists were staying clear of the flooded area while public works crews inspected to see whether the road was undermined by the flooding.
Kennebunk Town Manager Richard Erb said parts of Route 9 were closed. "We've also got a lot of localized street flooding," Erb said. Kennebunk firefighters were pumping out the basements of some homeowners who sought assistance.
Gc043,0160,0160,1006.Fueled by hurricane
The heavy rain fell in a narrow band just a couple of hundred miles wide. It took 30 hours for the rain to move the 100 miles from York County to Augusta.
The northeaster was given a steady supply of moisture from Hurricane Lili, spinning thousands of miles away in the Atlantic Ocean.
"It's like a conveyor belt (of rain) and that conveyor belt goes all the way out 2,000 miles to the hurricane," said Tom Hawley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
Dozens of roads were closed, including busy sections of Route 1 in Scarborough and Saco. Major arteries were impassable, including Payne Road, where several motorists lost control and landed their cars in the marsh or in swollen ponds and streams.
"We're getting hammered," said Officer Joseph Giacomantonio of the Scarborough Police Department. A pair of motorists suffered hypothermia after their car slid into cold water along Beech Ridge Road about 4:30 p.m. They were treated for exposure by rescue workers.
Gorham and Westbrook both recorded more than 14 inches and Portland's total was 11.5 inches with the rain still falling.
Some motorists crawled in bumper-to-bumper traffic and then tried to cross a small river that rushed across Payne Road and Spring Street in Scarborough. The water was 2 feet deep on the road and gushing off the lower side of the street into a ravine.
Cars and trucks pushed waves across the windshields of oncoming traffic, and many simply didn't make it through the water. A small parking lot next to the intersection was filled with vehicles that had to be pushed out of the current.
One woman bailed out the back seat of her white Jeep Cherokee after one wave flooded the Jeep's engine and a second came just as she opened the door to get out.
Kristen Doyle of Westbrook stood sobbing in about 8 inches of water on the high side of Payne Road, her Chevrolet Cavalier dead in the water after a wave from a passing police car pushed water through the car's engine compartment onto her windshield.
Other drivers pushed her car out of the way, and Doyle began walking through the rain to her mother's home about 1 1/2 miles down Payne Road.
Most motorists were more cautious, turning around and searching for another way south. But with the turnpike backed up and Route 1 closed, that wasn't going to be easy.
"In this area, everything is gridlock," said Larry Burpee, an official with Department of Transportation in Scarborough. "You've got to go at least 25 miles inland to find a way" south.
Gc043,0160,0160,1006.Air service suspended
York County and southern Cumberland County caught the worst of the storm. Small rivers and streams were overrunning their banks.
Portland International Jetport took the unusual step of suspending jet service after the deluge overwhelmed storm sewers.
An inch and a half of rainwater accumulated on a portion of one runway, leaving too little room for jets to take off and land. Smaller commuter planes were still making occasional flights, said Jeff Shultes, airport manager.
"Things were going great, then we finally just hit the point where we couldn't take any more," he said. The airlines canceled afternoon jet flights into the airport at 1:30 p.m., after more than 8 inches had fallen in Portland.
The Maine Department of Marine Resources closed to shellfishing miles of mud flats from New Hampshire to Portland Head Light because of the heavy rain. Rain of more than 3 inches in 24 hours can flush toxins unfiltered and untreated into coastal waters making shellfish unsafe to eat, said Jan Barter, a marine resources specialist in the department's water quality division.
Businesses and homes in coastal and low-lying areas were hit hard by the deluge.
The Maine Mall closed early, and heavy rains swelled the Presumpscot River to 16 feet higher than normal, forcing S.D. Warren in Westbrook to shut down its plant. Most of the 1,300 workers were sent home early while maintenance crews raised motors from the papermaking machinery on the basement floor to the ceiling to protect the equipment from damage if the mill floods.
Workers on the second and third shifts were told not to report Monday.
Nonessential state employees were sent home about midday from state offices from Greater Portland south, as were workers at Unum in Portland and other businesses.
"I've never seen it this bad in 17 years," said John DiSanto, owner of Anjon's Italian Restaurant on Route 1 in Scarborough. "The water was waist-high in the parking lot. The whole first floor is under 6 inches of water."
'Strain on everything'
Pleasure boats that had not been pulled from the water were pounded by wind, some washing up on shore. One was being dashed to rubble on the rocks at Portland's East End.
"In a lot of ways this type of storm is worse than a hurricane," said Phineas Sprague Jr., owner of Portland Yacht Services. "The sustained winds are for a long time."
"The hurricane is a relatively short storm, very intense and short. This kind of storm weakens everything, puts a strain on everything. There are a lot of boats coming off moorings, lines chafing that would normally by all right," Sprague said. "Last winter was our first winter here. We said it couldn't get any worse." Helen Vassill, Old Orchard Beach

Abstract: The Town Council announced Monday that it has reached an agreement with a Chebeague Island landowner to allow public access to the ocean from Cordes Road, said Town Manager Robert Benson. The council also agreed to give the former town garage and land on Chebeague Island to the island's Historical Society. Benson said the group's long-term plan is to use the building for display space.

Full text: The Town Council announced Monday that it has reached an agreement with a Chebeague Island landowner to allow public access to the ocean from Cordes Road, said Town Manager Robert Benson.
Benson said there was a question of whether the road was public, but there is now access to the water.
The council also agreed to give the former town garage and land on Chebeague Island to the island's Historical Society. Benson said the group's long-term plan is to use the building for display space.
The council also voted to close Johnson Cove on Chebeague Island to shellfish harvesting for a year for conservation purposes. The closure was recommended by the Shellfish Commission.
In other business, the council joined two separate pieces of land along Route 1 that comprise a tax increment financing district. The Dahlgren property, as it's called, has been zoned for office space or commercial use.
Benson said there are no businesses there now, but the town decided to use the tax breaks as an incentive for a business to locate there. A portion of money brought in by future development will help pay for improvements to the Dillenbach property, which the town acquired for recreational use.

The states and provinces bordering the Gulf of Maine adopted a new five-year plan Friday aimed at restoring and preserving the area's rich marine habitat.
Members of the Gulf of Maine Council said the main thrust of the plan is to rebuild shellfish beds, restore wetlands and reduce toxic contaminants in gulf's bays.
"It's a detailed blueprint to address the key issues concerning the environmental future of this precious international resource," said council chairman Bernard Theriault, New Brunswick's fisheries minister.
The Gulf of Maine Council includes representatives from Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
Janice Harvey, a New Brunswick environmentalist who attended the council meeting as an observer, was critical of the council.
"But we have seen no serious look at fish stocks, no action on some of the major problems," she said.

DIG A PECK OF CLAMS FOR THE TABLE

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]25 Nov 1996: 1.C.

Abstract: Freeport, Scarborough, Brunswick, Wells, Cumberland and many other towns sell recreational clamming licenses allowing residents to harvest a small cache of clams for personal consumption. In most towns, the limit is a peck a day - about eight quarts of clams - although some towns allow a peck per low tide. The state Department of Marine Resources determines whether a town can open its clam flats based on charting the cleanliness of the water and the clams themselves over a period of time. If a town wants to open its clam flats, it could take more than a year to gather enough data to determine whether they are safe or polluted.

If clams are on the menu for Thanksgiving, residents of some coastal communities don't need a grocery cart if they have a bucket, a hoe and a strong back.
Freeport, Scarborough, Brunswick, Wells, Cumberland and many other towns sell recreational clamming licenses allowing residents to harvest a small cache of clams for personal consumption. In most towns, the limit is a peck a day - about eight quarts of clams - although some towns allow a peck per low tide.
The state Department of Marine Resources determines whether a town can open its clam flats based on charting the cleanliness of the water and the clams themselves over a period of time. If a town wants to open its clam flats, it could take more than a year to gather enough data to determine whether they are safe or polluted.
Towns also decide whether to sell recreational or commercial clamming licenses and how many of each, based on the expected yield of clams as calculated by the state. Most towns create committees to monitor water quality and conservation, said Paul Anderson, director of the state Shellfish Sanitation Program in West Boothbay.
While a few towns sell recreational licenses to non-residents, would-be clammers who live inland have a tough row to hoe. Currently,their only option is to call each town and ask what the rules are.
"Many of these towns are protective of their resources and careful about who comes in," Anderson said. "It's understandable, but to do so sometimes slams the door on inland residents."
For people lucky enough to live in a clamming community, though, it's clam heaven.
"People just love to get their peck of clams once a week and steam 'em up and have at 'em," said Mick McGivaren, shellfish program coordinator in Freeport, where recreational licenses cost $10 for the year and are available from the town clerk.
It's always wise to check before putting hoe to sand. Freeport, which closes its flats if more than an inch of rain falls in 24 hours or if the sewage treatment plant discharges, has a hotline: 865-2904.
Otherwise, grab a four-tined hoe - commercial hoes have seven-tines - and start digging. Clams are usually about 8 inches down.
To find out where clam flats are open, call the Department of Marine Resources at633-9500.

Full text: Maybe you call it winter, mbut in the world of Maine commercial fishing, the season at hand is shrimp.
Starting Sunday, about 300 Maine boats are expected to hit the ocean in search of the pink shellfish. The state has had two exceptional years of shrimp fishing, and this one promises to be comparably strong.
Last season, which ran from December through May, 17 million pounds of shrimp were landed in Maine. It was the biggest catch in 23 years.
In 1994-95, 11 million pounds were landed here - and that was called a bumper year.
Dan Schick, a biologist at the state Department of Marine Resources, said ocean surveys show a robust population of shrimp available this year, primarily shrimp that were born in 1992.
But this may be the last season of the boom. Schick said fewer shrimp have been born in the years since then.

Abstract: Correction published Sunday, December 1, 1996: The Bay Harbor Restaurant in South Portland is open seven days a week, from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. A review of the restaurant on page 2E of the Nov. 24 Telegram reported incorrect days of operation. We dined the night of a debut menu, which the general manager, Jim Rosolino, said retains the refined, upscale quality of former selections but removes the notion that the restaurant is restricted to tourists with gourmet tastes (and fat wallets). Rosolino, owners John Howard and Peter McCullum (there for just over a year), and chef Stephen Crocker aim to provide meals that the local crowd can find reassuring. Crocker, at Bay Harbor since August, has 15 years of experience and a degree from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., where he won several awards. He tried out the new menu's dishes as specials for nearly two months. Rosolino expects the menu will remain the same through the winter.

New clients land in town, and you need a good place to schmooze. It's Tom's graduation, and Grandma Helen is a world-famous finicky eater. Or it's your anniversary, and a romantic dinner in a setting overlooking the water would do nicely.
Bay Harbor Restaurant would suit any of these occasions. Bay Harbor has what I call good function food, which is appropriate, considering the restaurant bills itself as a boon for banquets.
The food isn't flashy. It's the predictable stuff that everybody knows and likes, such as salmon, haddock, swordfish, pork loin, chicken and beef tenderloin.
The chef, however, doesn't forget to stick his neck out a little. The chicken roulade ($14) is stuffed with spinach, ham and pistachios, and served over homemade risotto, all enveloped in a chicken glace.

Crocker, at Bay Harbor since August, has 15 years of experience and a degree from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., where he won several awards. He tried out the new menu's dishes as specials for nearly two months. Rosolino expects the menu will remain the same through the winter.
Crocker offers a good boost to the basics. He dresses up fresh Maine crabs, for instance, in several ways. There's a timbale appetizer combining shredded crab with shaved fennel, lime juice and minced cilantro, topped with a red and yellow pepper coulis ($8).
My companion tried a delectable crab cake entree ($13), with at least one-inch thick crab cakes accompanied by lemon herbed rice, pureed squash and jalapeno mayonnaise. The rice was light and fluffy, not gummy, and good rice is a staple that can challenge even a well-tempered chef.
Five appetizers priced from $6 to $8 were offered. We tried a mushroom medley ($6) that included cremini, shiitake and cultivated mushrooms caramelized with julienned onions in olive oil, thyme and Madeira, and topped with an interesting Parmesan crusted shell and a dollop of creamy polenta. It was meant to be sprinkled with crispy bacon, but it wasn't, which didn't matter.
The sizable portion is enough for two, and there were plenty of flavors mingling on the plate. I thought the amount of Madeira created an overwhelming sweetness, but my friend enjoyed the way it offset the mild Parmesan shell and polenta, the latter two adding texture more than taste.
There are six soups and salads in the $3 to $9 range. We tried a house salad ($3), but there are more interesting selections for the money, such as the red oak leaf salad with Anjou pear, gorgonzola cheese, toasted walnuts and a port wine vinaigrette ($7). Standard soups are available: clam chowder ($4 for a cup, $5 for a bowl) and lobster bisque ($5 cup, $7 bowl).
My entree's sauce didn't upstage the main attraction of sauteed lobster, jumbo shrimp and sea scallops ($19), the highest-ticket item among the 14 entrees, alongwith the beef tenderloin ($19) with a bordelaise sauce, onion ragout and crumbled gorgonzola.
I didn't have to search for the seafood - it was bountiful, but the lobster and shrimp were tough, not springy. Shellfish is good on its own, so adding sauce should highlight its delicate flavor without masking it. The tomato coulis, which included minced fennel and julienned, colored bell peppers, didn't overshadow the fish, but it just fell flat and didn't enhance it, either.
I expect a $19 dish to be outstanding, and this wasn't. However, it was the first night of the menu, and I could see the dish evolving into something memorable.
What did have incredible oomph was dessert. We tried a remarkable pumpkin cheesecake with cognac ($4.95).
The wine list is substantial, perhaps too heavy on the California selections, with 16 reds and 16 whites in the $13 to $48 per bottle range. Glasses are $4 to $5.50. We tried a Murphy Goode Fume Blanc ($21), which coordinated well with the seafood.
Excluding wine and tip, our meal came to $45.95.
From the outside, Bay Harbor is a nondescript, boxy building with a brightly lit, discotheque-like awning stretching over the entrance. Inside, the white linen tablecloths, Windsor chairs, dim lighting and clean white walls provide a simple yet sophisticated atmosphere that doesn't outshine the main attraction - the expansive windows overlooking the shimmering ripples of the harbor. Here, the waterfront is the focus of magic and mystery.
Bay Harbor understands - with its decor and its menu - that the basics do not need to be boring.

Full text:   He's the kind of guy people want to avoid. He's loud. He's insulting. He's a confrontational street person.
But Richard Max Strahan is one panhandler whose rantings the public cannot ignore. Because when Strahan says he intends to save whales by ending the lucrative business of lobstering in New England - slicing the economic and symbolic heart of Maine - he means it.
His weapons are formidable: a supporter who is a legal expert in the Endangered Species Act; a sympathetic U.S. District Court judge; the free services of a big Boston law firm; and an intellect and vigor that even his foes admire.
"I've talked to him several times, and said, `Max, what you're doing is great,' " said Douglas Beach, protected-species coordinator for the National Marine Service's Northeast region, an agency being sued by Strahan. "It is outside interest pressures that make things happen."
Nevertheless, his extreme views make Strahan repugnant in many quarters. Maine Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden can barely contemplate his threats to close the state's famous $102 million lobster fishery.
"The prospect of shutting down that industry is untenable," Alden said. "Think of the tourist dollars involved."
`I'm looking for a shutdown'
Due partly to the man known as "Mad Max," attention being paid to the right whale probably is greater than it's been since the League of Nations in 1935 banned their hunting throughout the world.
Despite more than a half-century of legal protection, the giant mammal continues to swim at the edge of extinction. Only about 300 right whales live in the North Atlantic, making them the most endangered large whales in the world. Many of the whales come to New England in spring, bound for feeding grounds in the Bay of Fundy on the Canadian border.
Whale hunters gave the animal its name because it was the "right whale" to hunt.Its exceptionally thick layer of fat causes the animal to float when killed; most whales sink. The corpse was easy to tow to shore, and would yield 50 to 90 barrels of oil.
Given its buoyancy, the whale tends to live near the water's surface, making it especially vulnerable to human activity.
The two biggest human threats to the whales are collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear, mainly lobster traps and sink gillnets. Strahan contends that the federal government and Commonwealth of Massachusetts have done virtually nothing to minimize the dangers.
Claiming that their inaction violates the Endangered Species and Marine Mammal Protection acts, he is suing both.
Maine, he promises, is next.
"They're going to call me Maniac Max," Strahan said gleefully during a recent interview in the office of his Boston attorney.
A restless man with wavy graying hair down past his shoulders, a handlebar mustache and toothless smile, Strahan is indigent, with no permanent address or phone. He does have an e-mail address.
"I'm looking for a shutdown," Strahan declared. "We're saying the National Marine Fisheries Service should bust the state of Maine for killing whales."
Ensnared in fishing gear
There is no proof that lobster traps or other fishing gear in Maine ever killed a right whale. Researchers have documented only three such deaths across the East Coast of North America since 1970.
But entanglements appear to be common. Scientists at the New England Aquarium inBoston, who have studied the right whale for 17 years, say that 57 percent of the mammals have scars that suggest they've snagged fishing lines. The lumbering whales might tow buoys, ropes and nets for years, the gear possibly impairing their ability to feed, swim and mate.
Because so few whales remain, the untimely death of even one is considered critical. The federal fisheries service calculates that the population can take no more than one death every 2 1/2 years at the hands of humans if it is to recover.
Alarmingly, eight right whales died between July 1995 and March 1996. Three were victims of ship strikes, one of entanglement. What killed the other four is unknown.
Before the spate of deaths, researchers were content to stay in their boats, offices and laboratories. "We didn't push it. We didn't go to Congress. Who wants to deal with the press?" said Philip Hamilton, an assistant scientist on the aquarium's right whale team.
The deaths shook their complacency. "It made us take notice, and it gave us a dramatic example to show people," Hamilton said.
At the same time, Strahan was busy in court. In April 1995, he sued the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, contending that it violated federal laws protecting whales in authorizing the use of gillnets and lobster gear in state waters.
This fall, U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock leaned in Strahan's favor.
"It is clear that endangered whales use Massachusetts coastal waters where gillnets and lobster gear are placed, and that gillnets and lobster gear have harmed endangered whales and are likely to continue doing so," the Boston-based judge wrote in a memorandum dated Sept. 24.
Woodlock ordered the state to prepare a proposal to restrict, modify or eliminate such fishing gear in Massachusetts waters that are designated as critical habitat for northern right whales. The plan is due Dec. 16.
One possible outcome of the plan is that lobstering and gillnetting would be restricted in waters where the whales gather during the spring migration.
Shudders through Maine
By saying that Strahan made sense, Woodlock sent shudders up the coast to Maine, where lobsters generated $102 million in wholesale sales last year. In Maine, 7,188 people call lobstering their livelihood. Another 177 have permits to catch finfish using gillnets, which are set vertically like curtains in the water.
The romantic image of fishing harbors graced with trim lobster boats and colored by tough and weathered fishermen is part of Maine's identity.
Beyond the image, the tie to the sea is very real and emotional for people whose families have long sustained themselves on the ocean.
"That's life itself," said Al Jordan, a third-generation lobsterman from Milbridge who works shoreside now, selling lobsters for Portland Shellfish.
In Jordan's view, the unique culture of coastal Maine deserves protection, too.
"These guys who go out fishing, they ain't like everybody else," said Jordan, who goes by the nickname "Weird Al.""We're the endangered species here."
Strahan scoffs at such sentiment, responding with statements that are heresy to New Englanders who value the history and culture of commercial fishing.
"Commercial fishing is becoming more harmful to the environment than any benefit," he said. "I don't have any sentimentality that would allow me to waive (fishermen) from obeying the law."
Zygmunt Plater, a Boston College law professor who gives Strahan moral and sometimes financial support, calls the activist a brilliant zealot.
"He immediately goes to the crux - the pressure point," said Plater, who is one of the country's foremost experts in the 1973 U.S. Endangered Species Act.
Plater was the lawyer who initiated the landmark 1976 case Tennessee Valley Authority vs. Hill, in which he successfully invoked the Endangered Species Act to stop dam construction that threatened a fish called the snail darter.
(Though Plater won in court, the TVA ultimately built the dam after Congress passed a law exempting the project from the act. The authority transplanted snail darters in another river.)
Strahan said he contacted Plater after reading the TVA vs. Hill case. That was in 1983. Five years later, Strahan filed suit to protect the spotted owl in forests coveted by loggers in the Pacific Northwest.
Vegetarian and Buddhist
Strahan apparently has no formal legal or scientific training, although he calls himself a conservation biologist. He is secretive about his personal life. During a 90-minute interview, he revealed only that he grew up in western Massachusetts, and described himself as about the same age as - or maybe a little younger than - the rock star Bruce Springsteen.
Strahan also said he's a vegetarian and Buddhist, practices the martial art tai chi every morning, and can recite the sonnets of Shakespeare from memory.
Sometimes, he solicits money from passers-by at Quincy Market in Boston. Sometimes he swears at those who turn him down or challenge his credentials. His disruptive behavior has caused him to be kicked off the Boston College campus and the premises of the New England Aquarium.
Plater said one of Strahan's strengths is his willingness to say unpopular things and press against tremendous institutional resistance.
Strahan says, for example, that the National Marine Fisheries Service has a conflict of interest when it comes to protecting the right whale and other endangered marine animals.
The agency, an arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and U.S. Department of Commerce, is charged with managing the country's ocean fisheries, guarding protected species and ocean habitat and inspecting seafood.
"Their job is to do the one thing that inherently kills the whales: putting fishing gear in the water," Strahan said.
Beach, the fisheries service's regional coordinator for protected species, acknowledges that the agency's roles sometimes conflict.
"The Magnuson Act, Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act have conflicting goals," Beach said, speaking of the law governing fisheries and the laws protecting wildlife. "So yeah, the agency's been faced with that for the 20 years that those acts have all been there."
The man in charge of coordinating the sometimes competing interests of the fisheries service, regional director Andrew Rosenberg, disagrees strongly with the idea that one body can't regulate fisheries and protect whales at the same time.
"It seems to me that the Endangered Species Act says that you do have to take action (to protect whales). The question is, what action should you take that will have the most benefit without having a lot of side effects that are unnecessary and have no benefit?" Rosenberg said.
Given the small number of documented cases of fatal entanglements involving right whales, Rosenberg said, it's not clear that removing fishing gear from the water would help the species much, if at all.
He also questioned whether surviving whales that bear scars actually have been tangled in fishing gear, rather than rope from some other source.
Rosenberg said Strahan's court actions don't help the whale at all.
"In fact, (the actions) may have caused us to divert effort, as opposed to focusing on those things that could most help the whales," he said. "For example, it's cost $40,000 to compile the administrative record (for the court case). That's $40,000 we could use for right whales."
In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the federal government spent $965,000on the right whale, including money for research, study groups, monitoring and ship warning systems. Rosenberg said alerting, educating and negotiating with people who use the ocean about the need to protect whales is more productive than trying to manage the problem in court.
Strahan's uncompromising stances could provoke a backlash that impedes efforts to protect the whale.
Patten White, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, said lobster harvesters won't report entangled whales if they fear the information will brand them as criminals.
"If I report I'm entangled with a whale, they're going to spin out there and wrap my boat up in yellow tape - I'm not going to step on my boat for two weeks," White said.
Al Jordan, the former lobsterman now in sales at Portland Shellfish, said he's heard fishermen react aggressively to Strahan's threats to end fishing.
"In talking with some guys who are a few cans short of a six-pack, I've heard them say, `If there's only 300 whales between me and fishing, then it could be solved,' " Jordan said. "If that's a threat, you eliminate the threat. We're talking survival here."
Even Strahan's lawyer, Jon Ettinger, distances himself from his client's positions.
Ettinger, an associate in the Boston firm of Foley, Hoag & Eliot, represents Strahan in his case against the federal government. (Strahan acts as his own counsel in the case against Massachusetts.)
"The goal of the suit that I represent Max in, it's not to shut down shipping, and it's not to shut down lobstering," Ettinger said. "We will have succeeded if we have forced the federal government to do whatever it can to save the whale."
Toward that goal, the firm has donated an estimated $200,000 in legal services in the past year, Ettinger estimated. The company took the case pro bono after Strahan was referred by Plater, the Boston College law professor.
Ettinger, an environmental litigator, said the firm has the prospect of recovering legal fees from the defendants if Strahan wins, but that isn't why it took the case.
"He may seem extreme, but he's right," Ettinger said. "The National Marine Fisheries Service wasn't doing its job. These suits have focused their efforts on saving the right whale."
Whales studied, named
Over the years, the fisheries service has funded research at the New England Aquarium to study right whales, creating an extensive photo catalog of the population. Researchers know some of the whales so well that they've given some names - Slalom, Spitball, Stripe - and can identify many at a glance.
The government also has funded a team at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Mass., to disentangle whales.
Beach, fisheries service regional chief of protected species, said that as information about the whales has accumulated over the past 15 or so years, the agency has stepped up efforts to protect the animal.
Strahan boasts that he's been responsible for a number of actions by the agency - designation of critical habitats, formation of protection committees and so on. Agency officials say they would have acted regardless.
The truth, probably, is somewhere in between.
Said Beach: "We start doing something, and in the usual bureaucratic way, it takes forever. Then he (Strahan) jumps on them and says `Get it done, get it done, get it done,' and pushes it, and it goes through, and he says he did it."
What Strahan's threats clearly have done is draw public attention to the whale's plight.
Jordan, the former lobsterman in Portland, said he's been puzzling on his own over ways of changing lobstering to make the ocean safer for the whale. People have talked about radio-controlled buoys, for example, that mark the location of lobster traps to eliminate the need for ropes.
Jordan said that until Strahan entered the scene, he hadn't thought about lobster traps and whales. "I didn't have a need to, I guess," he said. -------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- FOR LINKS to Internet information on right whales, see the Press Herald's World Wide Web site: www.portland.com
"Right whales truly look like sea monsters when they skim feed. They lift their upper jaw high out of the water (6 to 8 feet)...Their great tails thrust powerfully to force them forward against the tremendous drag of their open mouths. As they move methodically back and forth through a patch of plankton, they look like giant lawn mowers cutting invisible grass. One right whale...alone is an amazing sight; 10 to 15 feeding together...an extraordinary mirage." Philip Hamilton, associate scientist, New England Aquarium, writing in Right Whale Research News

Staff art by Paul Kolsti and Rick Wakely Sources: New England Aquarium; Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary; Whale Net; staff research The Right Whale With fewer than 300 remaining in the world, the northern right whale is one of nature's most fascinating creatures What are those funny-looking bumps? The bumps are called callosities. The tough, cornified white skin patches appear on whales in the same areas that humans have hair - on the top and sides of their heads, over their eyes (eyebrows), near their ears (sideburns), around their blowholes (mustaches) and under their lips and chins (beards). Living on these callosities, are some unusual "hitchhikers": whale lice less than an inch long that spend their entire lives aboard the whale. How to identify a right whale Identifying features include the absence of a dorsal fin, a narrow upper jaw and curved lower jaw, and a deeply notched tail with a smooth trailing edge. The flippers are short and very broad. Its head is approximately one-third its body length. The whale can grow to about 55 feet in length and weigh as much as 139,000 pounds. Touch freely Right whales are unusually tactile. Their tendency to roll and touch one another makes it difficult for reasearchers to keep tags on them to track their movements. Life span The whale can live 60 to 80 years. V-shaped blow Unlike humans, who can breathe even when unconscious, whales must consciously control each breath. The blow visible at the surface is the whale's exhaled breath. Blows can be seen and heard almost a mile away on a clear, calm day. The blow from a right whale has a distinctive V-shape. Other whales tend to have a single, bushy blow. Multi-chambered stomach Scientists believe the whale has three major chambers (and perhaps a fourth smaller chamber whichmay be an extension of the intestine.) Total capacity of the stomach of a large whale is about 200 gallons, and can process about 4,400 pounds of plankton daily. Reproductive organs A right whale's reproductive organs have some distinctive features. The female's nipples are hidden within skin slits on either side of her belly. In males, the penis is coiled within the body cavity. The erect penis may reach a length of 10 to 11 feet. A male's testes may weigh a half-ton apiece. Right whales become sexuallymature slightly earlier than humans. Blubber About 40 percent or the whale's body weight is composed of a 12-inch layer of fat. No wonder the whalers loved the right whale. It's a storehouse of blubber. Why so much fat? First, it keeps the whale warm; second, it stores nutrients; third, it heightens the whale's hydrodynamic properties. But compared to other whales, right whales have a relatively large girth to their length. Perhaps that's why they are one of the slowest swimming whales. Whale of a tail Right whales move their tails up and down, rather than side-to-side like fish. This motion evolved from the natural flexing of the backbone in a running mammal. However, unlike its ancestors that stayed on land, the whale lost its hind limbs and its front limbs evolved into flippers which are used for steering and stabilization (not for propulsion). The up stroke of the up-and-down oscillation of the tail is what powers the whale's forward progress. The down-stroke returns the fluke to the starting position. How it feeds For feeding, the whale uses a mouthful of fringed plates called baleen, which can be 9 feet long. As the whale swims, water passes through the center of the whale's mouth and out through the baleen. Any small animals, such as copepods, juvenile krill, and other small zoo-plankton, are caught in the fine hairs. When the whale has collected enough food, the short, thick tongue pushes out the excess water, closes the opening, and sweeps the food from the plates back to the esophagus. Researchers speculate that one factor limiting the right whale population is competition for food. Sei whales and Atlantic herring are just two of many animals that eat copepods. 'Critical' habitat In March and April, right whales congregate in the plankton-rich waters of Cape Cod Bay, Great South Channel and Georges Bank off Massachusetts to stock up on nutrients. This area has been designated the northeastern "critical habitat" for the northern right whale. In summer, some swim north off the Maine coast to feeding grounds in the Bay of Fundy. In autumn the whales head south. Some cows and calves appear in the waters off Georgia and Florida in winter. No one knows where the rest of the whales spend the season. 1.

Abstract: Although there is still concern about the long-term effects of the Sept. 27 spill, especially in the salt marsh, preliminary studies so far show there has been no widespread mortality or oiling of finfish, mussels or clams. Green crabs, periwinkles, anemones and other marine life that dwell on the river bottom appear to be healthy and active. "We found a much more rich and diverse community down there than anybody expected to find," said John Sowles of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. "The Fore River's actually quite a remarkable little place." Although Sowles said he is confident that the immediate impacts of the oil spill were minimal, he cautioned that "there's always that question of (impaired) growth and reproductive effects and that sort of thing down the road."

Full text: Scientists looking for oil spill damage in the Fore River have been pleasantly surprised by how well some creatures living there weathered the disaster.
Although there is still concern about the long-term effects of the Sept. 27 spill, especially in the salt marsh, preliminary studies so far show there has been no widespread mortality or oiling of finfish, mussels or clams. Green crabs, periwinkles, anemones and other marine life that dwell on the river bottom appear to be healthy and active.
And a diver who swam under the bow of the docked Julie N just 10 days after she suffered the spill found that even those waters were unexpectedly teeming with life.
"We found a much more rich and diverse community down there than anybody expected to find," said John Sowles of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. "The Fore River's actually quite a remarkable little place."
Although Sowles said he is confident that the immediate impacts of the oil spill were minimal, he cautioned that "there's always that question of (impaired) growth and reproductive effects and that sort of thing down the road."
Researchers from six states and federal agencies have been working over the past few weeks on a "pre-assessment" of the damage caused by the spill in Portland Harbor. These initial studies, estimated to cost $322,000, will help determine if more long-term research is needed and will lay the groundwork for a restoration plan.
Many of the studies are ongoing, with their final results not expected until December or January, according to Paul VanCott of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
As a result, no formal conclusions about the damage to natural resources will be made until after the first of the year.
"As a practical matter, however, we will move as quickly as possible to restoration planning because we don't want to spend more time studying impacts than we have to," VanCott said.
Although the early results of the damage-assessment studies look promising, they provide only a snapshot of environmental conditions in the Fore River.
Marine scientists are still collecting and analyzing samples of river sediment and mussel tissue to see if hydrocarbons are hidden there. And wildlife biologists still are doing weekly helicopter flights to keep an eye on the migrating waterfowl that stop in the marshes to feed and rest.
But it's hard not to hear a collective sigh of relief in scientists' voices when they talk about the results that have come in so far.
Water samples taken in the days immediately after the spill show that the oil apparently did not mix far down into the water.
"The (hydrocarbon) levels were one to two orders of magnitude below the levels that would affect the most sensitive species," Sowles said.
A survey of mussel beds and mud flats upstream of the Portland Bridge found blue mussels and the other invertebrates living there moving, feeding and behaving normally.
Seth Barker, oil spill co-ordinator at the Maine Department of Marine Resources, says he expected the survey to find plenty of dead shellfish, considering the magnitude of the 170,000-gallon spill and the fact that there was toxic No. 2 fuel oil in the mix.
"They seem to have survived the exposure to the oil," he said. "That doesn't mean there's not going to be long-term effects further on down the line."
Diverse life inhabitat
If the widespread survival of these marine creatures was unexpected, even more surprising was the diversity of life that was found in the river during surveys of the bottom habitat.
A diver carrying a video camera covered four areas, three of which were within oiled areas of the Fore River. The fourth was a reference site near Tukey's Bridge that was used for comparison.
Sowles said he expected the video to show dead or heavily oiled marine life. What it showed instead were seemingly healthy green crabs, periwinkles, whelks and blue mussels, as well as anemones, scallops, coralline algae and sponges - creatures that he never expected to see so close to a tank farm, a sewage treatment plant, an airport and a mall.
"And this was right underneath the bow of the Julie N when she was tied up and being patched," he said. "That's Sprague Terminal, and ships come and go in there weekly. I always figured that a dredged area like that that gets exposed to these huge propellers would be scoured out clean. But no, it wasn't. There was kelp, there was several types of seaweeds."
The video camera will come out again this week as a diver surveys a different type of habitat: the hard, vertical surfaces such as bulkheads and abutments that are home to anemones, seaweed, periwinkles and other forms of marine life.
The diver will film four to five of the hardest-hit areas of the river that have not been cleaned, Sowles said. There also will be a reference site for comparison.
Although there were no obvious fish kills in the Fore River after the spill, scientists did arrange for two days' worth of trawls to see what kind of fish they could catch and the condition they were in.
The upper Fore River may serve as a nursery area for young winter flounder and Atlantic herring. And cleanup workers reported seeing mummichogs, an important forage species for birds and other predators, swimming underneath the oil.
"We went upstream as far as we could get with a small boat and trawl, and actually did not catch any finfish at all," said Linda Mercer, chief scientist at the Department of Marine Resources. "We did catch some invertebrates - some green crabs and shrimp - but no fish."
Mercer said some species may have already left the river for the season and headed out to warmer ocean waters. And the mesh of the net may not have been small enough to hold onto everything it pulled up.
"I think we made enough trawls that we were comfortable that there had not been any mass mortality of fish," she said. "We weren't trawling up dead organisms or oiled organisms."
Still, workers will be seining some areas of the river this week as a follow-up to make sure there are no dead or severely oiled fish.
Long-term effect unknown
The jury's still out on any long-term effects the spill might have.
If, for example, hydrocarbons build up in the tissues of soft-shelled clams, blue mussels, worms and other invertebrates, birds and the other predators higher on the food chain could be atrisk.
Wildlife biologists have been collecting tissue and sediment samples in a study that will look at the impact of the spill on the food supply of migratory birds.
Birds were perhaps hit the hardest by the spill. Between Sept. 29 and Oct. 18, 1,613 birds - mostly gulls and cormorants - showed signs of oiling.
Wildlife biologists will continue to monitor birds both from the air and the ground until winter settles in, said Richard Dressler of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
There are two basic issues the wildlife department is trying to address, Dressler said: the direct injury to birds, and the damage to their habitat.
The degree of oiling found in different habitats will be included on the map that's being prepared by NOAA and the DEP, Dressler said, "so we'll be able to match that up with where we're seeing the (injured and dead) birds. The basic idea is to determine what the potential for injury was to the birds."
Patrick Corr of the wildlife department is continuing his weekly helicopter flights to count birds in the Fore River and surrounding area. He is particularly watching out for migratory birds that will be moving in over the next several weeks.
The abundance and distribution of birds in the area is already changing as cormorants, wading birds and shorebirds move out and mallards, mergansers and teal take their place.
"A lot of the herons have moved out that were there during the spill, and we're seeing other birds moving in from the north, like buffleheads and some of the migratory species," Dressler said. "There's more black ducks in the area."
Oily birds still found
Although the potential for birds getting into trouble is diminishing - the heavy rain storms a couple of weeks ago weathered the oiled grasses in the marsh - it is still an issue.
"There are still some birds being observed with oil on them," Dressler said.
All of the studies being done for the damage assessment will provide an unprecedented snapshot of theFore River at a particular moment in time, and may provide a better appreciation for the life that goes on there after the shock of an oil spill.
"I can't imagine hearing about an incident going any better," Sowles said. "The next one - and there will be one, whether it's next year or in the next 20 years - I just expect that it can't go as well as this, and we won't be as lucky." WILDLIFE HOT LINE
Although the bird rehabilitation center was shut down long ago, wildlife officials are still interested in hearing from people who find oiled or dead birds. Call the wildlife department's hot line at 1-800-295-2435.

Abstract: In addition to voting on national, state and local offices, Maine voters will be handed a separate ballot containing eight referendum questions. Four of them are bond issues totaling $40.5 million. First, it provides $1 million for roof and masonry restoration at Fort Knox State Historic Site in Prospect, overlooking the Penobscot River. This huge granite fort, nearly a century and a half old, has suffered greatly from unrepaired water damage over the past 50 years, but is now undergoing a major restoration. This expenditure will complete the current series of repairs, and is to be supplemented by $900,000 in a publicprivate fund-raising effort. The other major project is the replacement of Churchill Dam at the source of the Allagash River with a new, concrete dam. The present structure, made of timber cribs, was built in 1968 and is more than a decade beyond its useful lifespan. The rapidly deteriorating dam is used to control water levels on the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, and if it is allowed to collapse, down-river rapids, fishing and picnicking spots will be harmed. The bond issue will raise $1.4 million for this new dam.

Full text: In addition to voting on national, state and local offices, Maine voters will be handed a separate ballot containing eight referendum questions. Four of them are bond issues totaling $40.5 million.
The Portland Newspapers recommends a "yes" vote on each of these four bond issues. Here's why:
QUESTION 4 would spend $3 million on improvements at state parks and historic sites.
Two of those locations are the principal beneficiaries of this bond issue.
First, it provides $1 million for roof and masonry restoration at Fort Knox State Historic Site in Prospect, overlooking the Penobscot River. This huge granite fort, nearly a century and a half old, has suffered greatly from unrepaired water damage over the past 50 years, but is now undergoing a major restoration. This expenditure will complete the current series of repairs, and is to be supplemented by $900,000 in a publicprivate fund-raising effort.
The other major project is the replacement of Churchill Dam at the source of the Allagash River with a new, concrete dam. The present structure, made of timber cribs, was built in 1968 and is more than a decade beyond its useful lifespan. The rapidly deteriorating dam is used to control water levels on the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, and if it is allowed to collapse, down-river rapids, fishing and picnicking spots will be harmed. The bond issue will raise $1.4 million for this new dam.
In addition, $600,000 will be spent on improving handicapped access to a large number of state parks and historic sites, as required by the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. More than a federal requirement, these improvements are also a matter of simple justice.
QUESTION 5 would spend $16.5 million for cleaning up hazardous substance discharges, tire stockpiles and closing and cleaning up old landfills.
Some $2.5 million would be spend protecting ground water by cleaning up PCBs, coal tar and other toxic compounds at sites in Ellsworth, Meddybemps, Brewer and Paris. While state and federal governments do seek cleanup funds from responsible businesses or individuals, when those polluters have no resources or can't be identified, public money has to be spent to protect the public's health.
Second, the bond issue would spend $5 million on cleaning up some of the 50 million scrap tires stockpiled across the state. Such stockpiles are significant fire hazards, and cause pollution because the tires melt when they burn; their liquified components, which are truly toxic, can enter groundwater supplies.
Combined with increased enforcement of anti-dumping laws, this money will allow the state to begin a serious tire cleanup effort for the first time.
In addition, the bond will spend $9 million on landfill closure and cleanup, a continuation of an effort that has been going on for years in Maine. Since the bonding program began in 1987, voters have approved seven landfill closure bonds totalling $59 million. In that time, 261 of 392 municipal landfills have been closed and capped. This year's money would be distributed to towns and cities of all sizes throughout the state.
QUESTION 6 would spend $11 million to establish revolving loan funds for two critical areas of the state's economy, agriculture and small business.
The Agriculture Marketing Loan Fund, with $6 million, will lend money to agricultural and natural-resource-based sectors of the economy. Patterned on the successful Potato Marketing Improvement Fund, the money will give businesses easier accessto credit and greatly benefit the state's rural areas.
The Small Enterprise Growth Program, capitalized at $5 million, will offer loans up to $150,000 to firms with high growth potential that are likely to bring capital into the state. Examples include marine sciences, biotechnology, precision manufacturing, software, value-added natural resources, environmental and insurance/financial firms.
QUESTION 7 would spend $10 million to clean up the state's water supplies.
It would allocate $8 millionto the Department of Environmental Protection to spend as follows: $4 million on large water pollution control facilities in communities where such methods provide economies of scale; $2 million in a revolving loan fund (to be matched by $10 million in federal funds) so communities can address overflow problems or upgrade present sewage treatment facilities; $1 million in the Small Community Grants Program to towns where a centralized treatment plant is not an option; and $1 million to the Overboard Discharge Program where current systems are releasing sewage onto shellfish grounds and small drainage areas.
The rest of the bond, $2 million, will be combined with federal funds to create a revolving loan program (at no interest) to upgrade some or all of the 800 public water treatment systems eligible under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.
WHILE THESE newspapers have been reluctant to spend bond money for routine improvements that ought to be funded by the Legislature out of general tax revenues, these bond issues appear to us to be justified. With maintenance in mind, however, Maine's state parks and historic sites need the Legislature's attention the most, as their upkeep has been sadly neglected.
That, though, is a separate issue. These bond issues are good for Maine and deserve a "yes" vote on Tuesday.

Abstract: The storm destroyed some animals' homes, and choked rivers and streams with sediment and debris. And it made Casco Bay look like hell, turning the water into a dark brown soup. "The color - it's indescribable, but it's not healthy looking," said Joseph Payne, the Casco Bay Keeper. "The other thing is the bay smells different. It doesn't smell like `Aaah, that salt air.' It smells like fresh water gone bad." So much fresh water rushed from the rivers into the bay that even water surrounding the outer islands saw dramatic drops in salt content. Offshore waters near Potts Harbor and Eagle Island usually have an average salinity of 28 parts per thousand, or 2.8 percent salt. By Wednesday, it had dropped to 18 parts per thousand in the top three to five feet of water.

Full text: The monster storm that blew into Maine last week flooded homes, stranded commuters and knocked out Portland's water supply.
But it took a toll on Mother Nature, too.
The storm destroyed some animals' homes, and choked rivers and streams with sediment and debris. And it made Casco Bay look like hell, turning the water into a dark brown soup.
"The color - it's indescribable, but it's not healthy looking," said Joseph Payne, the Casco Bay Keeper. "The other thing is the bay smells different. It doesn't smell like `Aaah, that salt air.' It smells like fresh water gone bad."
The sheer power of last Monday's rainstorm can be seen in the salinity measurements taken Wednesday by Friends of Casco Bay.
So much fresh water rushed from the rivers into the bay that even water surrounding the outer islands saw dramatic drops in salt content. Offshore waters near Potts Harbor and Eagle Island usually have an average salinity of 28 parts per thousand, or 2.8 percent salt. By Wednesday, it had dropped to 18 parts per thousand in the top three to five feet of water.
And at Fort Gorges, between Portland and Peaks Island, the salinity dropped from 28 to an astounding six parts per thousand.
"We've never seen it that low," Payne said.
The fresh water floating on the surface of the outer bay won't harm the creatures that live there, scientists say. Zooplankton can simply migrate downward, for example, and seals are used to bobbing in fresh water occasionally when they swim up rivers.
But fish and wildlife living in and around the rivers and estuaries may be having a more difficult time, either because of the flooding itself or the changes it brought to their environment.
While the floods probably didn't kill a lot of animals like beaver and muskrat, some of them probably did lose their homes and are already starting to rebuild, says Lois Winter of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Fishand invertebrates living in the rivers and streams may have trouble getting enough oxygen because of the tremendous loads of mud, silt and clay that were washed downstream by the storm, Winter said.
A longer-term concern, she added, is damage to spawning areas.
"Generally, fish like to spawn in pebbly, gravelly areas," she said, "and if those areas have gotten covered over in lots of silt that remains until the next spawning season, they're going to have lost some important spawning habitat."
If pollutants were washed downriver along with the sediments, they could work their way into the food chain. And that could pose some long-term problems for migratory waterfowl and other wildlife that prey on fish and invertebrates that may become contaminated.
Fish ladders that help migrating fish get up and around dams in the springtime are probably clogged with silt and debris, she said, and will have to be cleaned out.
A big influx of freshwater can sometimes kill marine critters that aren't used to radical changes in salinity more quickly than pollutants like sewage or toxic contaminants.
In tidal zones along the coast, the water's salinity probably dropped low enough for a long enough time to kill some of the animals that live there, says Lee Doggett, a marine biologist with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
As a rule of thumb, Doggett said, when salinities drop below 20 parts per thousand some intertidal animals start to get stressed.
Some animals that can't tolerate the rapid change just leave. Fish such as sculpins, flounder and cunners swim out with the tide. Lobsters, crabs and shrimp can move as well.
But shrimp-like amphipods, tiny crustaceans that live in the sediments, probably couldn't get away. Sea urchins and star fish, especially brittle stars, also may have perished.
Clams probably closed themselves up and shut down their systems to ride out the crisis.
"All of the clams and the shellfish have been feeding all summer, so they've built up glycogen reserves," said Sandy Sage, director of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences. "They'll be able to live off that for right now."
Marine worms such as sandworms and bloodworms can take the biggest beating because they can just go into their burrows.
Salinities will probably be back to normal within a couple of weeks because of the area's high tidal range. "It'll probably return sooner to levels creatures can handle," Doggett said.
The timing of the storm was both a blessing and a curse.
If the floods had raged through a springtime landscape, the roiling waters and tremendous loads of sediment flushing down toward the sea would have ravaged active spawning grounds. Young clams and other creatures that live in tidal areas would have been hit at their most sensitive stage of life.
On the other hand, the storm came right on top of Portland's oil spill last month, giving the animal and plant communities that live along the coast a one-two punch.
"It's an unfortunate timing of one thing after another," Doggett said. "They can't take endless stress just like a human can't. It's analagous to your immune system (being) down, and you get hit again."
There have been some bright spots, mostly for bird watchers.
Nor'easters can blow sea birds in over land, a delightful surprise for local bird enthusiasts. An eagle-eyed teacher at the Breakwater School in Portland on Thursday spotted a juvenile red-necked phalarope feeding in a pool of rainwater on the school's playing field. Word of the sighting got out quickly.
"Normally you have to go out on a boat some distance offshore to see phalaropes this time of year," said Richard Eakin, a biology professor at Westbrook College, "and here's this little thing just feeding like crazy in this little rain pool."
Also on the field were ring-billed gulls feasting on earthworms that drowned in the rainstorm.
Eakin said the oil spill was probably far more damaging to migratory birds than the big storm and subsequent flooding.
Some birds may even benefit from the aftermath of the storm. Ducks and gulls seem to be having a "high old time" feeding on little invertebrates and other morsels that have been stirred up in the water and mud, he said.
Back Cove "was quite murky the other day, and I think if anything it's benefitted the wildlife," he said. "They love that sewage. They'll pick up disgusting little things that you and I wouldn't even want to talk about." -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- FOR LINKS to Internet information on floods in Maine and elsewhere, see the Press Herald's World Wide Web site: www.portland.com

COZY KING EIDER'S: IT'S EVERYTHING A PUB SHOULD BE

Abstract: Damariscotta was desperately in need of a casual haunt for locals to find something - anything - that wouldn't smack solely of tourism. The answer came this past June, when Larry and Sherry Schneider opened King Eider's Pub. King Eider's has all the pluses of a pub - a cozy atmosphere, hearty food and good beer (five on tap, 17 in bottles) - but none of the minuses, like a beer stench, loud noise or a greasy cloud. I wouldn't call King Eider's food adventurous, but a "less is more" philosophy is its selling point. The food doesn't force you to ask questions. It's the kind of menu that doesn't overwhelm, but it isn't lacking in honest inspiration, either.

Full text: J.M. Falla is a free-lance writer who lives in midcoast Maine. Falla dines anonymously. Restaurants are visited once, with a second visit when necessary. The Telegram pays for the meals.
Damariscotta was desperately in need of a casual haunt for locals to find something - anything - that wouldn't smack solely of tourism. The answer came this past June, when Larry and Sherry Schneider opened King Eider's Pub.
King Eider's has all the pluses of a pub - a cozy atmosphere, hearty food and good beer (five on tap, 17 in bottles) - but none of the minuses, like a beer stench, loud noise or a greasy cloud.
Tourists are welcome, of course, but the restaurant doesn't feel like a trap. Instead, King Eider's invites you into a homey nook.
The renovated brick building includes exposed brick and beams inside, yellow walls, plaid curtains, original watercolors, and sturdy wooden tables, booths and benches. The decor is more upscale than usual for a pub.
The two dining rooms are on the small side with fairly close seating, and there's a 10-seat bar downstairs, a two-table outdoor deck, and an oyster bar upstairs that's too snug. Oysters are part of the theme - they are eaten by the king eider ducks, for which the pub is named.
I wouldn't call King Eider's food adventurous, but a "less is more" philosophy is its selling point. The food doesn't force you to ask questions. It's the kind of menu that doesn't overwhelm, but it isn't lacking in honest inspiration, either.
Nightly specials span several categories. You might sample turkey vegetable soup; linguine with mushrooms, carrots and sun-dried tomatoes; swordfish with a thyme cream sauce; pork chops with caramelized apples or a ribeye steak topped with a blue cheese, walnut butter.
There are eight regular entrees, such as honey-glazed chicken and sauteed crabcakes, plus the specials, all in the $8.95 to $14.95 range. You could also sink your teeth into a generous sandwich (cold roast beef or chicken, for example) or a burger, accompanied by hand-cut fries, ranging from $4.75 to $6.25.
Three salads are offered for $2.25 to $3, including a house, Caesar and the chef's "Signature Salad," which includes walnuts and chevre atop mixed greens with a homemade vinaigrette.
Appetizers range from $3 to $6.60. The chicken wings are what I call painful, but my companion said they are good for the brave palate that craves lots of spice, and the server provides warning.
The food is fresh and well-prepared, and the portions are generous for the prices. Desserts ($3 to $4) are exceptional and massive, and they showcase the chef's goal of using the freshest ingredients for homemade food.
The chef, Stephanie Redfern, was most recently a part owner of Truffles in Bath, and before that she worked in Manhattan. On our last visit, we tried a piece of apple walnut cake for $3.50, topped with a chocolate caramel rum sauce - perfect for two and better than Mom's.
There's a wine list, too, comprising six white and eight red selections from California, Spain, France, Chile and Australia. Bottles are $12 to $22, or $3.50 to $5 per glass.
Without dessert and wine, our bill came to $21.25 for a salad, appetizer and two sandwiches. During an earlier visit, we spent more than $30 for salads and larger entrees.
The restaurant's setup has some glitches. One of the counters in the upstairs bar is just below open windows cut out of a brick facade, where you can awkwardly peek through to diners in the room next door.
The small entryway can cause a gridlock if people are going upstairs while others are coming down. But one welcome addition in the entry is Larry Schneider, who is perched by the door to greet all who enter.
A visit to King Eider's wouldn't give you any inkling that the Schneiders are newcomers not only to Damariscotta but to the restaurant business. You find all of that out after talking with Schneider, whose engaging manner beckons you to speak with him about your meal, the weather or your Uncle Harry.
Schneider is a fixture, like Norm of "Cheers," and King Eider's has that "Cheers" feel. It's a place where the employees (mostly the Schneider's friends and family) have a vested interest in your satisfaction. They'll remember you, whether you've been there once or a hundred times.

Abstract: Southern Maine began drying out in the sunshine Wednesday as roads gradually were made passable and water service was restored to virtuallyall of Greater Portland. Water service was restored Wednesday to virtually all of the 140,000 customers of the Portland Water District who lost pressure or service when raging floodwaters broke four water mains Tuesday. Businesses throughout the region reopened during the day Wednesday, with many bringing in drinking water for workers. One exception was the S.D. Warren paper mill in Westbrook, which remained closed as crews worked to clean equipment.

Full text: Southern Maine began drying out in the sunshine Wednesday as roads gradually were made passable and water service was restored to virtuallyall of Greater Portland.
Searchers pulled the body of a Scarborough man from a swollen brook into which he had been swept Monday night. Robert Snow, 42, was the storm's only fatality in Maine.
The region's cleanup began in earnest Wednesday, two days after Maine was inundated by its biggest rainstorm in history.
In Old Orchard Beach, residents returned to their homes and piled soaked belongings in front yards to dry. "People are happy we didn't have in our community any major injuries," said Mike Nugent, the town's code enforcement officer.
In Westbrook, where the flooded Presumpscot River had receded, Dennis and Lucy Cobb pumped 4 1/2 feet of water out of their basement and were busy disinfecting the floor. "My daughter's room was down here, so she lost her bed," said Dennis Cobb.
State and federal officials spent the day trying to come up with damage assessments. The figure is expected to exceed the conservative initial estimates of $10 million.
Teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency began inspecting the damage and meeting with local officials. Gov. Angus King formally asked President Clinton to declare Cumberland and York counties disaster areas, and said other areas could be added.
"I have determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments and that supplementary federal assistance is necessary," King said in a letter to Clinton. The assistance could be authorized as early as next week.
Water service was restored Wednesday to virtually all of the 140,000 customers of the Portland Water District who lost pressure or service when raging floodwaters broke four water mains Tuesday.
Water officials also began testing for bacteria in the water supply and said they hope the results will allow them to lift a boil-water order by noon today.
Businesses throughout the region reopened during the day Wednesday, with many bringing in drinking water for workers. One exception was the S.D. Warren paper mill in Westbrook, which remained closed as crews worked to clean equipment.
Downtown Portland, a soggy ghost town on Tuesday, appeared virtually back to normal by Wednesday afternoon - except for the flow of people to the Central Fire Station for free drinking water.
Schoolchildren remained home Wednesday, but most schools were set to reopen today as roads dried out and toilets flushed. School officials said they planned to bring in drinking water for students.
Westbrook schools will remain closed, however, because of washed-out roads and bridges.
State and town officials put hundreds of repair crews to work patching and fixing key routes to alleviate commuter headaches caused by the storm damage.
A section of the Maine Turnpike near Exit 6 in Scarborough was opened to one lane of traffic Wednesday, and turnpike officials said they hoped to do enough repaving to open a second lane for today's morning commute.
Although the northboundturnpike remained closed between Exits 7 and 8, crews were rebuilding the roadbed Wednesday and were expected to start paving later in the day. A spokesman said he hoped one lane would be open today.
Around southern Maine, scattered local roads and bridges remained closed while crews continued repairs. Traffic on the turnpike and on local roads also may be reduced to one lane at times while road crews repair shoulders, replace guardrails and pave sections that have been partially repaired.
Shocking rainfall totals
Mainers on Wednesday were still shocked by the amount of water that fell between Sunday morning and Tuesday morning. The storm dumped 19 inches on Camp Ellis in Saco and 13.5 inches in Portland. No storm in history here had ever come close to those totals.
The storm's only known casualty was confirmed Wednesday.
Volunteers in Scarborough found the body of Snow, who drowned after the truck he was driving Monday night plunged off a washed-out portion of Old Blue Point Road into Stuart Brook.
His wife, Cindy, was riding in the truck when it crashed but was able to swim to shore and call for help.
Snow's body was found by a friend at 8 a.m. Wednesday amid tall grass about 200 yards downstream from where his white pickup truck lodged in the middle of the brook.
Snow probably sank to the bottom Monday night and was found as the water level in the brook dropped, said Scarborough police Sgt. Angelo Mazzone.
Mazzone said he is still unsure what led Snow to try to cross the washed-out road at 9 p.m. Monday, during the height of the storm that dropped more than 15 inches of rain on Scarborough. Snow appeared to be trying to use a back road to avoid Pine Point Road through the Scarborough Marsh, which was underwater.
Cindy Snow told police that there were no barricades on the road as she and her husband approached the washed-out span on Old Blue Point Road, though orange and white sawhorses were set up at 6:30 p.m. and were still in place at 8 p.m., Mazzone said.
One troublesome possibility, Mazzone said, is that another motorist moved the barricades, something emergency workers contended with throughout the worst of the storm.
"People were moving the barricades all night and nobody puts them back," Mazzone said. The Snows "could have fallen victim to somebody else moving them."
Patching the arteries
The Route 302 bridge in Westbrook, which Tuesday was under 6 feet of water, reopened to traffic shortly before noon Wednesday. City officials also expectedto reopen Methodist Road to traffic by the end of the day.
Westbrook officials upgraded their damage estimates to $1.5 million, prompting an emergency meeting of the City Council to discuss the repairs needed.
Councilors approved Mayor Kenneth Lefebvre's request to begin borrowing money so the city could hire contractors to fix the damaged roads and bridges.
"We just need to forget about bidding emergency bridge repairs," Lefebvre said. "We need to get available contractors on a timely basisto get this work taken care of."
While Lefebvre expects the federal government to pay for most of the repairs eventually, he said the city must borrow money in the short term to begin the work immediately.
Inspectors from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Small Business Administration assessed damage Wednesday.
"The teams began this morning doing preliminary damage assessments to determine the damage," said Ed Wojnas, chief spokesman for FEMA. "They walk and inspect and look, along with a local official."
The inspections are done to verify that the area qualifies for federal relief. Homeowners and businesses would be eligible for low-interest loans if the area qualifies, Wojnas said.
Grants are available only to homeowners who have lost the use of their homes. They can receive one-time grants to pay three months of rent while their houses are repaired.
Water service restored
The only Portland Water District customers without water Wednesday evening were residents of 10 homes on outer Broadway in South Portland. Their service will be restored early today when new temporary piping arrives, said Jeff Nixon, director of operations for the district.
The district needs to connect the neighborhood to another main because they normally draw water from the section of pipe that broke early Tuesday.
Four water pipe breaks were found and sealed off Tuesday. In addition, a 6-inch pipe at Bridge Street in Westbrook broke apart at about 4 a.m. Wednesday, apparently becauseof the rapid return of pressure in the system. It was quickly sealed off and repaired to restore service to 12 homes.
Also Wednesday, the district installed a temporary water line around a leak near Pope Road in Windham to restore water service to about 14 customers.
Water district crews, aided by receding floodwaters, also staunched much of the raw sewage flowing into local rivers and Casco Bay since Monday.
State officials closed shellfish flats from Portland to New Hampshire on Tuesday as millions of gallons of sewage overflowed pipes and treatment plants that were overwhelmed by storm runoff.
Overflows of combined sewage from valves scattered around Casco Bay tapered off as the flow of water into sewers became more manageable.
Water district crews repaired one of two flooded pump stations that were leaking sewage.
The Stroudwater Pump Station off Blueberry Road in Portland was once again sending sewage toward the treatment plant, instead of into the Stroudwater River. "They have got that pump station temporarily rigged to pump sewage," said Daniel Jellis, general manager of the district.
It is expected to take a couple of more days to pump out and repair the East Bridge Street Pump Station in Westbrook, which is leaking sewage into the Presumpscot River.

Full text: Millions of gallons of raw sewage poured into Casco Bay and local rivers as Monday's torrential rains overwhelmed wastewater treatment plants across southern Maine.
The threat of bacterial contamination from the untreated sewage forced state officials to close shellfish flats from Portland to New Hampshire. Eroded soil, street runoff and other debris cascaded into the water, creating a strange, turbid soup.
"The water has an awful gray color that I've never seen before," said Joe Payne, baykeeper for the Friends of Casco Bay, after a walk along the waterfront early Tuesday. "It makes me queasy just to look at it."
Treatment plants in York and Cumberland counties were drowned in up to 18 inches of rain.
Much of the water overflowed the tanks. Water that made it inside the tanks pushed through thecleaning process more quickly - and less rigorously - than usual. Millions of gallons shot directly into Casco Bay and the Saco, Scarborough and Presumpscot rivers.
Aside from the effect on shellfish flats, the untreated material poses no significant health risk, health and sanitation officials said. The unprecedented rainfall swelled the bodies of water and served to dilute the contaminants.
"It's like the proverbial drop in the bucket," said Charles McDowell, director of wastewater services forthe Portland Water District. "It (the rainfall) is so great, the issue of the raw sewage is . . . insignificant."
Storms often push treatment plants beyond their limits, and equipment is built into the system to send out the overflow, untreated. But never have sanitation officials in the area seen so much stormwater bypass the treatment system.
Too much water, too fast
At the Portland Water District's plant on the city's East End, 82 million gallons coursed Monday through a plant usually handling 17 million gallons. The Westbrook plant, designed for 4.5 million gallons, carried 15 million gallons at the peak of the storm. A pumping station, still under water Tuesday, remained inoperable, keeping about 200,000 gallons a day untreated.
In Saco, water pressure under the tanks - increasing as the water table rose Monday - combined with the heavy water inside to rupture one tank at the treatment plant.
Operations will continue as usual, said City Administrator Larry S. Mitchell, but if thetank needs to be replaced, the cost will run from $600,000 to $800,000. Disaster relief, insurance, or as a last resort, raised sewer fees would be needed to pay for the tank's replacement. A complete damage assessment will take a few days, Mitchell said.
At the S.D. Warren mill in Westbrook, a treatment plant that handles industrial wastewater was completely flooded by the Presumpscot River.
"We're having trouble even getting to the plant, let alone getting it to work properly," said Stuart Rose, an environmental specialist at the state Department of Environmental Protection.
Clam flats doused with sewage
Even as officials such as Rose noted the effect of the rain in diluting pollutants, the state Department of Marine Resources closed the coast to shellfish harvesting Monday from the New Hampshire border to Portland Head Light in South Portland.
More flats were shut down Tuesday at Freeport, the mouth of the Kennebec River in Phippsburg and the mouth of the Medomak River in Waldoboro.
Most closures caused by heavy rains are lifted after about a week. But this storm may keep diggers off the beaches for two to three weeks, said Paul Anderson, the department's director of shellfish sanitation.
Some of the worst contamination may occur in Scarborough, where highly productive clam flats were doused with raw sewage from broken pipes at a plant that discharges to the Scarborough River.
"That's serious pollution," Anderson said. "It may take a while for that to be repaired and cleaned up."
Dave Corbeau, marine resources officer for Scarborough, said the town's 35 commercial diggers would suffer from the closure.
For the moment, though, they were too busy finding lost boats and helping each other to worry about their own losses, he said.
"We've got a lot of problems down here," Corbeau said, "and it goes beyond the clam flats right now."
In an interview by cellular phone from the Scarborough River, where he surveyed the damage from a boat, Corbeau described a scene of devastation.
"We're seeing everything from life jackets to boats and trees wash up out here," he said. "We had a coastal cleanup just about a week ago, and now it's a mess again."
Marine animals threatened
Lee Doggett, a biologist at the Department of Environmental Protection, said the flood of fresh water into Casco Bay could affect marine animals by driving the salinity, or salt concentration, of the water too low.
Urchins, starfish, lobsters and other creatures that live in subtidal zones can be stressed by too little salinity, she said.
Researchers at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science found that after a hurricane in that state, floods of fresh water dislocated an entire subtidal community for several years, Doggett said.
Payne, the Casco Bay baykeeper, said he hoped to go out on the bay today to measure salinity and other environmental conditions.
The closed shellfish flats will be tested daily for bacterial contamination, beginning today, Anderson said.

Abstract: Environmental experts who studied Maquoit and Middle bays for the last two years told the Town Council on Monday night that the town could do more to prevent another disaster like the one that killed thousands of shellfish, fish and worms in 1988. A consultant, Scott Horsley, said nitrogen can cause algae blooms, which can lead to a massive bay kill. He suggested the town look at increasing the boundaries of its Coastal Protection Zone, which mandates a minimum five-acre lot size. Most of the nitrogen that gets into the bays comes from homes outside the Coastal Protection Zone, according to Horsley and [Michael D.] Giggey.

Full text: Environmental experts who studied Maquoit and Middle bays for the last two years told the Town Council on Monday night that the town could do more to prevent another disaster like the one that killed thousands of shellfish, fish and worms in 1988.
Authors of two companion studies recommended the town improve agricultural practices, which can cause contamination; increase public awareness of water quality issues, and determine the bays' capacity for handling pollution.
Councilors took no action on the studies, which were done by Wright Pierce Engineers and Surveyors of Topsham and by Horsley & Witten Inc. of Boston, Mass. However, the studies will play an integral role in future zoning and planning.
"We feel thetown is doing almost everything very well, but with some fine-tuning they can even be better," said Michael D. Giggey, vice president of Wright Pierce.
A consultant, Scott Horsley, said nitrogen can cause algae blooms, which can lead to a massive bay kill. He suggested the town look at increasing the boundaries of its Coastal Protection Zone, which mandates a minimum five-acre lot size. Most of the nitrogen that gets into the bays comes from homes outside the Coastal Protection Zone, according to Horsley and Giggey.
Wright Pierce's study surveyed 563 septic systems along Brunswick's shoreline. It concluded that little pollution is caused by septic systems that fail. It also recommends that public sewers not be extended to the Coastal Protection Zone.
The zone, they found, has the potential to accommodate up to 855 housing lots.
On another matter, a request from a private developer for the town to preserve 72 acres as open space sparked a heated debate among councilors. The issue was tabled. It will be discussed at the council's Nov. 18 meeting.
Cumberland County CoHousing Community of Portland has Planning Board approval to build 27 units on Hacker Road. As part of its agreement with the board, it was to have given the town a conservation easement across its land.
Councilor Ervin Snyder said the town should not coerce developers into giving the town "land rights." Snyder suggested a local land trust would be better suited for accepting land gifts.
"I think these kinds of easements in perpetuity show some arrogance on our part," Snyder said.
"I think conservation easements are wonderful. It's a way to preserve green space for our children," Councilor Eleanor Swanson said.
The issue was tabled by a 6-3 vote with Swanson, Faith Moll and David Gleason opposed to any further delays.

A record-breaking storm pummeled York County and southern Maine with more than a foot of rain Monday, packing wind gusts up to 40 mph, flooding rivers, washing out roads, causing dozens of accidents and stranding scores of people.
A storm-high 18.6 inches soaked Camp Ellis, flooding roads. Hardest-hit was Old Orchard Beach's Ocean Park neighborhood, where emergency crews in motor boats rescued more than 40 residents stranded by four feet of water lapping at their doors.
Sixteen emergency shelters were set up in Biddeford, Saco, Old Orchard Beach, Wells and Cumberland County. Schools closed early and businesses shut down in a reaction more common for heavy snowfall than a hard rain.
The National Guard was called out because roads were so bad that heavy trucks were needed to take to shelters some residents of Scarborough and Westbrook trapped by the rising waters Monday night.
Gov. Angus King declared a state of emergency in York, Cumberland and Oxford counties and planned to fly over the stricken area in a helicopter this morning if the weather permits.
Relief officials said Old Orchard Beach suffered the worst of the flooding. Most major and minor roads in and out of town were blocked by as much as four feet of water.
The town "is literally isolated," said Bob Bohlmann, director of the Emergency Management Agency in York County.
Ocean Park's central square was one large pool of water with a stretch of West Grand Avenue under water, as were parts of East Grand Avenue and much of First Street.
"Last winter was our first winter here. We said it couldn't get any worse," said Helen Vassill of West Grand Avenue in Old Orchard Beach as she and her husband, Jim, rolled up their wet pant legs in the shelter at the Loranger Middle School.
"At 8 a.m. it wasn't that bad," Helen Vassill said. "From 8 to 9 it came up so fast. It was going in the cellar window like a waterfall."
The Vassills,along with many others, were evacuated by motorized rubber boat and taken by ambulance to a shelter.
Traffic was backed up for miles along the Maine Turnpike. Water streamed across the interstate in Kittery and across the turnpike in Biddeford and Scarborough, leading to backups that were up to six miles long.
The turnpike was closed Monday night between Saco and New Gloucester because of wash-outs and water on the road.
Saco's Camp Ellis received the most rainfall in southern Maine, but it appeared to escape the serious damage often caused by storms.
Although a small stretch of Eastern Avenue was washed away, none of the homes that are often threatened by erosion from strong storms seemed in danger at high tide Monday night, said Sandra Bastille, a Camp Ellis resident.
Dozens of cars spilled off flooded roads Monday and police reported numerous small accidents and cars stalling in roadways covered with water.
Ann Mack of Old Orchard Beach said she didn't understand what all the fuss was about until she tried to drive to Portland late Monday morning. She had to turn back when she found Route 1 north closed and then drove into deep water on Walnut Street.
"The car started to float," Mack said. "With all my might I pushed the door open to get out." After she waded through water that was more than waist deep, a man in a car behind Mack's took her to the shelter at Loranger Middle School.
Heavy rains caused problems throughout the region:
In Westbrook at 10 p.m. Monday, police were trying to rescue an unidentified man from the Presumpscot River, behind 77 Bridgton Road. The man reportedly had been struggling in the river for more than an hour.
Police Chief Steven Roberts said the man may have passed a roadblock on Route 302, at the bridge where it crosses the river. Witnesses on the Portland side of the river said they saw the taillights to the man's truck go into the water and disappear.
In York, Railroad Avenue in the town square at York Beach was covered in some places by several feet of water, leaving only the tops of fire hydrants visible. Cars were stalled in water to the bumpers. Stores - even the few in that beach town that stay open through the winter - were closed.
The water was licking at the doors of Garfield's news stand and the York Beach Fish Market in the beach square.
York Fire Chief William Foster stayed in contact with the Red Cross to make sure that those wanting to evacuate their homes would get help from police or firefighters. He said most of the homes that were flooded were unoccupied summer cottages.
In Wells, a leaking roof at the high school forced an early closing, but part of the school was kept open for people seeking shelter from flooded houses.
Wells Town Manager Jonathan Carter said that the Tatnic Road overpass, which was under construction, was flooded and the entire road was shut down. He said a house at the end of Drakes Island was suffering the worst flooding and that the owner was given permission by town officials to shore up a seawall to prevent further erosion.
Biddeford Police Chief Roger Beaupre said some of the worst flooding occurred at the Exit 4 entrance to the Maine Turnpike at Route 111. Parts of Route 111 near the Arundel line were closed by water over the road.
"People are calling wondering how to get home and we're doing the best we can to give them directions," Beaupre said.
On West Street in Biddeford, Wilcox Pond overflowed its banks and covered part of the road. Motorists were staying clear of the flooded area while public works crews inspected to see if the road was undermined by the flooding.
Kennebunk Town Manager Richard Erb said parts of Route 9 were closed. "We've also got a lot of localized street flooding," Erb said. Kennebunk firefighters were pumping out the basements of some homeowners who sought assistance.
The heavy rain fell in a narrow band just a couple of hundred miles wide. It took 30 hours for the rain to move the 100 miles from York County to Augusta.
The northeaster was given a steady supply of moisture from Hurricane Lili, spinning thousands of miles away in the Atlantic.
"It's like a conveyor belt (of rain) and that conveyor belt goes all the way out 2,000 miles to the hurricane," said Tom Hawley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
Dozens of roads were closed, including busy sections of Route 1 in Scarborough and Saco. Major arteries were impassable, including Payne Road, where several motorists lost control and landed their cars in the marsh or in swollen ponds and streams.
"We're getting hammered," said Officer Joseph Giacomantonio of the Scarborough Police Department. A pair of motorists suffered hypothermia after their car slid into cold water along Beech Ridge Road about 4:30 p.m. They were treated for exposure by rescue workers.
Rainfall sets records
Gorham and Westbrook both recorded more than 14 inches and Portland's total was 11.5 inches with the rain still falling.
The rainfall set records in Portland of7.92 inches in 24 hours and 10.44 for a single storm, although the figures were expected to rise with the rain continuing Monday night. Both marks exceeded records set by Hurricane Bob in August 1991, when 7.75 inches fell in 24 hours and 8.16 inches fell before the storm ended.
Some motorists crawled in bumper-to-bumper traffic and then tried to cross a small river that rushed across Payne Road and Spring Street in Scarborough. The water was 2 feet deep on the road and gushing off the lower side of the street into a ravine.
Cars and trucks pushed waves across the windshields of oncoming traffic and many simply didn't make it through the water. A small parking lot next to the intersection was filled with vehicles that had to be pushed out of the current.
One woman bailed out the back seat of her white Jeep Cherokee after one wave flooded the Jeep's engine and a second came just as she opened the door to get out.
Kristen Doyle of Westbrook stood sobbing in about 8 inches of water on the high side of Payne Road, her Chevrolet Cavalier dead in the water after a wave from a passing police car pushed water through the car's engine compartment onto her windshield.
Other drivers pushed her car out of the way and Doyle began walking through the rain to her mother's home about about 1.5 miles down Payne Road.
Most motorists cautious
Most motorists were more cautious, turning around and searching for another way south. But with the turnpike backed up and Route 1 closed, that wasn't going tobe easy.
"In this area, everything is gridlock," said Larry Burpee, an official with Department of Transportation in Scarborough. "You've got to go at least 25 miles inland to find a way" south.
York County and southern Cumberland County caught the worst of the storm. Small rivers and streams were overrunning their banks and larger rivers like the Saco and Androscoggin are expected to approach flood levels in the next couple of days, Hawley said.
The Portland International Jetport took the unusual step of suspending jet service after storm sewers were overwhelmed by the deluge.
An inch and a half of rainwater accumulated on a portion of one runway, leaving too little room for jets to take off and land. Smaller commuter planes were still making occasional flights, said Jeff Shultes, airport manager.
"Things were going great, then we finally just hit the point where we couldn't take any more," he said. The airlines canceled afternoon jet flights into the airport at 1:30 p.m., after more than 8 inches had fallen in Portland.
Flats closed to fishing
The Maine Department of Marine Resources closed to shellfishing miles of mud flats from New Hampshire to Portland Head Light because of the heavy rain. Rain of more than 3 inches in 24 hours can flush toxins unfiltered and untreated into coastal waters making shellfish unsafe to eat, said Jan Barter, a marine resources specialist in the department's water quality division.
Businesses and homes in coastal and low-lying areas were hit hard by the deluge.
The Maine Mall closed early and heavy rains swelled the Presumpscot River to 16 feet higher than normal, forcing S.D. Warren in Westbrook to shut down its plant. Most of the 1,300 workers were sent home early while maintenance crews raised motors from the papermaking machinery on the basement floor to the ceiling to protect the equipment from damage if the mill floods.
Workers on the second and third shifts were told not to report Monday.
Non-essential state employees were sent home about midday from state offices from Greater Portland south, as were workers at Unum in Portland and other businesses.
"I've never seen it this bad in 17 years," said John DiSanto, owner of Anjon's Italian Restaurant on Route 1 in Scarborough. "The water was waist-high in the parking lot. The whole first floor is under 6 inches of water."
Power failures reported
Central Maine Power Co. reported scattered power failures. About 2,500 customers lost electricity in the Boothbay-Wiscasset area and another 200 or so were without power in Portland and Cape Elizabeth by late Monday.
CMP crews were kept busy disconnecting power from homes with flooded basements where circuit panels were in danger of getting wet and shorting out.
Pleasure boats that had not been pulled from the water were pounded by wind, some washing up on shore. One was being dashed to rubble on the rocks at Portland's East End.
"In a lot of ways this type of storm is worse than a hurricane," said Phineas Sprague Jr., owner of Portland Yacht Services. "The sustained winds are for a long time."
"The hurricane is a relatively short storm, very intense and short. This kind of storm weakens everything, puts a strain on everything. There are a lot of boats coming off the moorings, lines chafing that would normally be all right," Sprague said.
People took last-minute steps to prepare throughout the day.
At Coast Country Store, a hardware store on Cascade Road in Old Orchard Beach, Kevin Sullivan sold most of the 40 sump pumps he'd picked up in Portland earlier Monday.
"Some people can't even get here because the roads are blocked off," he said.
"It's like a conveyor belt (of rain) and that conveyor belt goes all the way out 2,000 miles to the hurricane." Tom Hawley, meteorologist

Abstract: Maine voters will consider eight referendum questions on the statewide ballot Nov. 5. In addition to deciding the controversial clear-cutting referendum, voters will consider proposals for congressional term limits, campaign financing, state spending and an amendment to the state Constitution. Question 1 asks voters if they want candidates for the state Legislature, Congress or governor to sign a pledge saying they support congressional term limits. If candidates refuse to sign, their refusal would be listed on the ballot. Maine's congressional representatives would have to support and vote for such an amendment - or sponsor one if no one else does - and state legislators and the governor would have to support asking for a constitutional convention to enact the amendment.

Maine voters will consider eight referendum questions on the statewide ballot Nov. 5. In addition to deciding the controversial clear-cutting referendum, voters will consider proposals for congressional term limits, campaign financing, state spending and an amendment to the state Constitution.
Question 1 asks voters if they want candidates for the state Legislature, Congress or governor to sign a pledge saying they support congressional term limits. If candidates refuse to sign, their refusal would be listed on the ballot.
What the ballot question doesn't include is that the pledge would commit lawmakers to working to enact a constitutional amendment limiting U.S. senators to two terms - 12 years - and U.S. representatives to three terms - six years.
Maine's congressional representatives would have to support and vote for such an amendment - or sponsor one if no one else does - and state legislators and the governor would have to support asking for a constitutional convention to enact the amendment.
Those who failed to do any of those would have the phrase "violated voter instruction on term limits" next to their names on the next ballot.
A "yes" vote approves the term-limit proposal, while a "no" vote rejects it.
Question 2 covers the clear-cutting issue.
Question 3 is a proposal to fund election campaigns with public money. The program, for state legislative and gubernatorial candidates, would be voluntary.
To qualify, candidates for governor would need to collect $5 donations from 2,500 voters; state Senate candidates would need $5 donations from 150 voters. Candidates for the house would need $5 donations from 50 voters. The money would go into a general fund.
The amount of money a candidate could get for his or her campaign would depend on the amount spent campaigning for that seat in the previous two similar elections. Candidates for a contested seat would get an average of the amounts spent in the last two contested elections; candidates for an uncontested seat would get an average of the amounts spent in the last two uncontested elections.
Voting "yes" on the campaign finance program approves it, while voting "no" rejects it.
The next four questions are bond issues, meaning the state is asking for permission to borrow money for expensive projects such as cleaning up landfills and building water treatment plants.
On all the spending questions, a "yes" vote approves the spending, while a "no" vote rejects it.
Question 4 asks voters to approve borrowing $3 million to pay for renovations and improvements at state parks and historic sites. Projects include replacing the Churchill Dam in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway, finishing renovations at Fort Knox in Prospect, and making renovations for handicapped access, said Gary Cooper of the state Elections Office, which has prepared a voters' guide on the referendum questions.
Question 5 proposes borrowing $16.5 million for environmental cleanups. The money would be broken down this way: $9 million to help towns close and clean up landfills, $5 million to clean up tire dumps, and $2.5 million to investigate and clean up discharges from hazardous materials, Cooper said.
Question 6 asks for $11 million for loan programs to help small businesses and agricultural and natural resource industries create jobs and expand. Charles Mercer of the Finance Authority of Maine said $6 million would go to help agricultural businesses such as aquaculture and forestry. The other $5 million would be directed toward small businesses such as software and technology firms.
Question 7 seeks $10 million for water treatment programs. Kevin Nelson of the Department of Environmental Protection said the proposal would provide $4 million to build new waste-water treatment plants, $2 million for a loan fund to help upgrade treatment plants, $1 million for a community grant program to help towns that don't have public sewer systems, and $1 million to help remove septic systems that empty into shellfish beds.
The other $2 million would go to the Bureau of Health for a loan program to bring public water systems into compliance with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. It would fund projects like building filtration systems or drilling wells for towns or water systems that have not met the requirements, said Dr. Phil Haines, deputy director of the state Bureau of Health.
Question 8 proposes an amendment to the Maine Constitution that would increase the timelocal clerks have to verify signatures on citizen initiative petitions.
People would have to file petitions with local officials 10 days before the certified signatures are due to the state, giving local officials five working days - instead of the current two - to verify the signatures.
Voting "yes" approves the amendment, while voting "no" rejects it.

FORE STREET: GOOD FOOD IN A SETTING THAT GRABS YOU

Abstract: Fore Street is a funky, casual restaurant wrapped in upscale packaging. And judging from the size of the crowd on the Sunday night we dined, it's the chic place to be. The prices could be taken down a notch; a dollar or two could probably be shaved from the entrees and the wines. But anyone likes to be able to afford the good things in life, and Fore Street's food is good. The open kitchen is what simultaneously adds to and detracts from Fore Street's atmosphere. Because the restaurant is in a large, open, former furniture store with high ceilings, there's a constant din of conversation and a sense of hubbub that is either enjoyable or disconcerting, depending on your mood.

Full text: J.M. Falla is a free-lance writer who lives in midcoast Maine. Falla dines anonymously. Restaurants are visited once, with a second visit when necessary. The Telegram pays for the meals.
If you walked into Fore Street wearing a traditional London Fog trench coat over a tie-dyed T-shirt, you'd probably fit right in.
Fore Street is a funky, casual restaurant wrapped in upscale packaging. And judging from the size of the crowd on the Sunday night we dined, it's the chic place to be.
The prices could be taken down a notch; a dollar or two could probably be shaved from the entrees and the wines. But anyone likes to be able to afford the good things in life, and Fore Street's food is good.
The head chef is Sam Hayward, most recently of the Harraseeket Inn in Freeport. Hayward co-ownsFore Street with Dana Street, who also owns Street & Company, well-known for its seafood.
The atmosphere is attention-grabbing. Call it crazy or courageous, but you have to admire a chef who's bold enough to cook right out in the open, calm and confident before all discerning diners' eyes.
The open kitchen is what simultaneously adds to and detracts from Fore Street's atmosphere. Because the restaurant is in a large, open, former furniture store with high ceilings, there's a constant din of conversation and a sense of hubbub that is either enjoyable or disconcerting, depending on your mood.
It's not the place for a romantic dinner for two. There is a small, cozy room off the main dining room, and perhaps a table in there would provide a more secluded, subdued feeling.
The stimulation continues when your entree arrives. There's nothing subtle about the enormous plates packed with large portions. The plates just fit on the small two-person tables that line the raised dining level and border a string of booths below.
There were 13 appetizers the night we dined, from a menu that changes daily, according to our waiter, who was first-rate. He explained many of the menu items in a thoughtful fashion and was at hand without being intrusive.
Appetizers and salads go up to $8.95. We tried a fall salad ($5.95) and rope-cultured mussels ($7.95), the latter of which were fresh and without the gritty quality you sometimes taste with mussels. The broth was seasoned with just enough garlic and wasn't too soupy.
Some of the menu items had comprehensive explanations, and others - such as the fall salad - did not. The plate reminded me of a collage of fall leaves, with a beautiful assortment of colors from vegetables including greens, string beans, carrots, roasted red peppers, red onion slivers, corn, yellow tomatoes, and a really nice surprise, chunks of plums - all dressed in a balsalmic vinaigrette.
There is an agreeable selection of entrees, starting at $12.95 for a pasta dish (gnocchi with vegetables, pomodoro sauce and mixed cheeses), ranging to grilled dab fillets for $17.95 and applewood-grilled yellow fin tuna for $18.95.
Food is either roasted or grilled in a wood-fired oven. Other entrees are braised, including a fish and shellfish stew ($15.95), and a rabbit and fresh chanterelles dish ($17.95).
We tried the dab fillets - a light white fish often mistakenly called sole, except that sole comes from the Pacific, while dab is found right here in Maine, our waiter explained.
The fillets came in a large mound on the plate, which I didn't expect. The fish was covered in an herb (lots of fresh basil) and black peppercorn crust, which was nicely done. However, the fish was large, and once the outside crust was eaten, chunks of plain fish were left, which were tender and flavorful nonetheless.
We also tried the misto platter ($15.95), which included duck confit, alderwood-smoked lamb, and two lamb and duck sausages, which had a spicy bite. The duck and lamb were tender and juicy. Confit is a cooking technique in which the leg-thighs of a goose or duck are simmered in fat rather than roasted. The excess fat is rendered out, leaving a nice crisp skin.
The dab fillets came surrounded by a colorful arrangement of braised greens (I tasted only cabbage), sauteed beets and pureed butternut squash. The braised greens were delicately seasoned and still retained a crunch, the squash was sweet, and the beets were tasty.
The starch, a barley pilaf, was disappointing. It had a distinctive seasoning and generous chunks of corn, celery and green peppers, but the consistency was gooey. The garlic mashed potatoes suffered the same problem - the seasoning was fine, but they were too pureed.
Fore Street's wine list is extensive, ranging from $17 to $55. Whites are divided into light and medium-bodied choices, with a lengthy list of Chardonnays. I counted 39 reds, either medium-or full-bodied.
Despite feeling stuffed, we tried one of eight desserts, a drab peach crisp with vanilla ice cream for $4. The bowl was huge, and the peaches were fresh, but the brown sugar syrup and crumble lacked flavor or distinction. One nice thing, though, is that it wasn't too sweet.
Our bill came to $58, excluding drinks and tip.
Overall, I enjoyed Fore Street's atmosphere and food, both of which are far from formulaic. There were special touches - such as serving dense, hearty bread from The Standard Baking Co.
Tucked in on the left as you walk in is an ample bar, which you could miss but shouldn't.It has a large counter and wingback chairs calling you in for an after-dinner liqueur.

DAMARISCOTTA: A SMALL TOWN SEES TWO SIDES OF PROSPERITY RETAIL SALES AND THE POPULATION ARE GROWING, BUT THE COMMUNITY ALSO HAS PARKING AND ZONING PROBLEMS AND A CROWDED SCHOOL.

Full text: On a blustery fall afternoon, Charlie Ault stood on the corner in his shirt sleeves, tie flapping, and peered down Main Street, eager as a schoolboy.
He'd just gotten word that the town's newly purchased, first-ever ladder fire truck was on its way.
And suddenly there it was. Bright and shiny red, sounding its air horn and spewing diesel smoke as it proceeded up the hill. "Wow, I hope it's not on fire," Damariscotta's first selectman said.
The $15,000 ladder truck, headed for the town's new $500,000 fire station, represented the latest investment in this fast-growing midcoast community.
At a time when many other downtowns are shrinking, Damariscotta has no empty storefronts. Retail sales are up, more people are moving in, and there is a general feeling of prosperity.
But like any community, growth has brought woes: inadequate parking, a need for zoning, and overcrowded schools.
Literally down the road looms a potential tourism setback.
Next fall, construction will begin on a new bridge spanning the Kennebec River in Bath. And early in the new century, Wiscasset will address the traffic backup over its bridge, across which more than 25,000 vehicles drive on a peak summer day. The projects are bound to slow summer traffic heading up the coast for vacations.
At first it may seem odd that Damariscotta, with a population of just 1,820, can support five banks, 18 lawyers, four architects and two weekly newspapers.
But the town serves many more.
It is the commercial hub for all of the towns on the Pemaquid peninsula, from South Bristol to Bremen, and along the Route 1 corridor from Wiscasset to Waldoboro.
Dan Daigneault, president and chief executive officer of The First National Bank of Damariscotta, sees the growth. Bank deposits have risen by $20 million - and loans by $50 million - over the last five years.
Larry and Sherry Schneider sensed it, and invested their life savings to open King Eider's Pub, a combination pub, fireside restaurant, oyster bar and patio, downtown in June.
"Business is 25 percent ahead of what we expected our first year," Larry Schneider said.
Visible from Route 1,Damariscotta is a picture postcard New England village. Boats bob in the harbor flanking its 19th-century brick storefronts, and tall white church spires rise from autumn-flared hills.
The town, whose name means "river of many fishes," has always been a center of commerce.
Some 2,000 years ago, the area was a summer meetingplace for Penobscot Indians, who left behind heaps of oyster shells 30 feet deep, accumulated over hundreds of years.
In the 1840s, large deposits of blue clay were found near the banks of the river and many brickyards started up.
Two decades later, Damariscotta became a thriving shipbuilding center, turning out some 60 schooners, barks, and swift clipper ships that traveled as far away as China to deliver Maine lumber, returning with sugar, molasses and rum.
There are two reasons for the town's success today. You can't get to the rest of the other towns on the peninsula without passing through Damariscotta. And Route 1 passes it by.
When the bypass, called Business Route 1, was proposed in the early 1960s, it created such an uproar that one proponent at a public hearing was booed off the stage. Storeowners feared people wouldn't stop and the town would die.
Now the bypass is considered the town's biggest asset. It allows people to park with relative ease, get out, stroll and shop. Merchants believe the bypass helped Main Street retain its charm and sense of place.
While the downtown lost its original five-and-dime store, and the Yellowfront Grocery has moved farther away, the library, pharmacies, bookstore, hardware store, clothing stores and restaurants are all within walking distance.
Among newer upscale stores are firms still owned by generations of Damariscotta families.
Waltz Pharmacy is one of them. It is run by Dean Jacobs, who took it over from his father, Winton Jacobs, who took over from his father-in-law, Pearly Waltz.
Maine Coast Book Shop owner Susan Porter has seen her business jump 45 percent since she tripled her space three summers ago. As more retired people settle in Damariscotta year-round, Porter finds she is ordering more copies of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.
But she also finds these same newcomers are among the biggest boosters of small-town living.
"They are tired of malls," said Porter. "They want to see small businesses survive."
Reny's business thrives
Anchoring Main Street is the original Reny's department store, Maine's off-price mecca and homegrown challenge to Wal-Mart, 47 years old this month.
R.H. Reny Sr., now 70, the unofficial "mayor" of Damariscotta, started it as a dry goods business occupying half a downtown storefront in 1949.
Business was so bad the first year that he had to sell his merchandise door to door. But he drank a lot of kitchen coffee and made a lot of friends. The next year, customers started coming to him.
Today R.H. Reny Inc., a multimillion-dollar business with 15 stores statewide, is also run by sons John, 45, and Robert, 44.
Until the mid-1950s, the Damariscotta River came right up to Main Street. When parking became a problem, store owners deeded over their flats to the town, to be filled to create a municipal parking lot.
Forty years later, the 250 parking spaces no longer accommodate all the tourists, employees and residents shopping and working downtown.
Merchants accept the problem with a sense of pride. "Thank goodness we have a parking problem," said John Reny. "If we didn't, we wouldn't be prosperous. I know people complain about it, but hey, it's a nice problem to have."
Nearly surrounded by water, the downtown has no place to grow, so business is galloping along upper Business Route 1, unchecked by zoning.
The new section, known as "the strip," is anchored by such familiar chains as McDonald's, Shop 'n Save and the Puffin Shop. A $1 million Rite Aid is under construction.
Water mains are being replaced all along the strip. "The capacity of our wastewater plant, which was built in 1986 and designed for 20 years use, has already been exceeded, we're growing that fast," said Mary Ellen Bower, head of the Great Salt Bay Sanitary District.
School overflows
It's quite a change for some residents, who remember the time before there was any road there at all.
William P. Brewer, 72, who traces his Damariscotta roots back to the 1600s, used to play baseball where Damariscotta Hardware is today. John Reny recalls haying the field now occupied by Shop 'n Save. Poole Brothers Lumber was built on the site ofa former country fairground. Round Top Center for the Arts, also on the business bypass, was once the largest dairy farm in the area.
Just beyond the strip, huddled behind a wall of portable classrooms, sits "Fort Damariscotta," the local name for Great Salt Bay School, K-8, combining kids from Damariscotta, Newcastle and, more recently, Bremen.
Designed for 325 students in 1980, it holds 450 today, half of them crowded into 11 outside classrooms, in seven buildings with toilets that freeze in winter.
The school has applied twice to the state to build an addition and recently was turned down for a second time for lack of funds, according to Principal Richard Marchi. Damariscotta high school students attend Lincoln Academy in neighboring Newcastle, along with kids from the neighboring towns. A new $1.8 million addition has eased the crowding there, according to Headmaster Howard Ryder.
Fifteen years ago, there was a push to merge the twin towns of Damariscotta and Newcastle, and build a single town office. Damariscotta residents quashed the plan, with the slogan "No Dam New Castle."
Fewer open spaces
For local lawyer and Lincoln County Commissioner James Gallagher, who grew up in Damariscotta, as his father did, the town's development has been bittersweet.
When he was a kid, he recalls, he used to get on a sled in the middle of a snowstorm and ride down Bristol Road to the cove where Miles Memorial Hospital now stands, the recipient of more than $4 million in bequests from the late Bremen philanthropist Elizabeth Noyce.
"Today, you could never do that," Gallagher said. "You used to be able to ride bikes on any road in town. That's changed, too."
Cars rule Bristol Road these days, keeping Gallagher up at night, and waking him up in the morning.
With no zoning, the business district is expanding into residential areas like Bristol Road, bringing confusion.
Overcoming obstacles
When Consultox Ltd., a consulting firm specializing in toxicology, moved to Damariscotta from Louisiana in 1994, owners Richard and Eileen Parent thought they had discovered Camelot.
Instead, they found nothing but trouble. "The growth in this area is disastrous," says Richard Parent.
At first, the couple could find no suitable office space to lease for their high-tech business. Richard Parent designs, orders and evaluates safety tests for pesticides, drugs and food additives for an international clientele. He also serves as an expert witness in courts around the country.
When they finally set up their office in a house on Bristol Road, they encountered problems associated with a parking ordinance. The access they needed to create the required parking spaces was claimed by Miles Memorial Hospital.
It took a lawyer, a surveyor, the help of local Rep. Chester Rice, and digging through 40 years of town records, over a period of two years, to learn that the road was really a public way, and the Parents could proceed.
"It shouldn't be this hard for clean, non-polluting companies like ours to come here," Eileen Parent said. "We're growing a business in spite of it."
Yet, avid sailors, they intend to stay.
"The coast here is so beautiful," she said. "And Damariscotta is the essence of Maine."
In November, Damariscotta will get its first stop light. But traffic may dwindle of its own accord when the Route 1 bridge and bypass projects get under way. So far, the prospect of a temporarily slower volume doesn't faze local merchants one bit. They are looking ahead to a time when Route 1 motorists arrive refreshed, instead of frustrated.
"It's like a bypass operation," said Reny. "It's gonna hurt at first, but we'll feel a whole lot better afterwards."

Full text: Eight years ago, marine life in Maquoit Bay mysteriously died off in one of the largest bay kills ever recorded off Brunswick's coastline. People blamed the deaths of shellfish, fish and worms on pollution from malfunctioning septic systems.
They were wrong - the latest in a string of studies finds.
A two-year study released Wednesday found that the 563 privately owned septic systems in Brunswick's 6,400-acre Coastal Protection Zone worked just fine. The zone borders Maquoit and Middle bays.
During a meeting at the town's Planning Department, the author of the study said that although the cause of the bay kill remains unknown, privately owned septic systems are not to blame. The study found that most systems are on large lots, which helps prevent pollutants from entering coastal waters.
"All we're recommending is more finetuning of what is already being done," said Michael D. Giggey, Vice President of Wright Pierce Engineers and Surveyors of Topsham. "There will be no sweeping recommendations in terms of additional regulations or cost."
Brunswick responded quickly to the bay kill. A study done in 1989 recommended creation of a Coastal Protection Zone, which mandates minimum five-acre lot sizes. However, town officials felt further studies were needed.
A Massachusetts firm, Horsley & Witten, Inc. - using money from a federal grant - did an in-depth analysis of pollution in Maquoit Bay. That two-year study, which was submitted to the Casco Bay Estuary Project, was completed last January. The study by Wright Pierce, begun in 1994, was completed this week. It only examined private septic systems and whether they were functioning properly. The study found that most were.
Giggey will present the report's findings to the Town Council when it meets at 7:30 p.m. Monday in the former Brunswick High School on McKeen Street. Public comment will be accepted. Copies of both reports are available at the town planning office.
The significance of the studies is that government intervention won't be necessary, said Town Planner Andrew Singelakis.
After the bay kill, some people discussed creation of a wastewater management district for the Coastal Protection Zone. Such a district would have given the town broad enforcement and regulatory powers. It could have mandated pumping of privately owned septic systems and increased inspections. It costs between $5,000 and $10,000 to replace a failed septic system.
Singelakis said he will also recommend that there be no extension of public water and sewer to homes located along the bays.
"In our opinion, the Coastal Protection Zone doesn't warrant a great amount of town oversight," Giggey said. "This (report) should not be construed as a recommendation that the town expand the Coastal Protection Zone, but weare recommending that the town step back and take a look at the entire Maquoit Bay watershed."
One step might be for the town to make minimum lot sizes more consistent throughout the watershed. Five acres is the minimum in the Coastal Protection Zone; two acres is the minimum outside the zone.
Giggey also recommends the town take the following steps:
Commission a study to determine how much nitrogen is entering Maquoit and Middle Bays, and the New Meadows River each year.
Improve agricultural management practices through education and enforcement.
Take a broader view of the problem looking at not just what can be done to prevent pollution in the immediate coastal zone, but throughout the watershed. That effort must be coordinated with the towns of Freeport, West Bath and Harpswell, which border the bays.
Improve public awareness of water quality and coastal protection issues through formation of citizens committee.
"There will be no sweeping recommendations in terms of additional regulations or cost." Michael D. Giggey

OIL-SPILL OFFICIALS DROP PLAN TO CLEAN MARSH WITH SOLVENT

Abstract: The Stroudwater Marsh on Monday resisted a cleanup plan developed by federal scientists, forcing the Coast Guard to look for new ways to remove oil from the Sept. 27 spill in Portland Harbor. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and others involved in the cleanup had planned to flush oil from the marsh grass with a solvent called Corexit. But the solvent raised other problems in the marsh - essentially, it thinned the oil too much for workers to recover it - and NOAA officials abandoned the plan. Scientists were meeting Monday night to consider other approaches to the problem.

Full text: The Stroudwater Marsh on Monday resisted a cleanup plan developed by federal scientists, forcing the Coast Guard to look for new ways to remove oil from the Sept. 27 spill in Portland Harbor.
Progress was made on another front, however. The Department of Marine Resources lifted a shellfishing ban that had stretched from Cape Elizabeth to the Royal River in Yarmouth.
Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and others involved in the cleanup had planned to flush oil from the marsh grass with a solvent called Corexit.
But the solvent raised other problems in the marsh - essentially, it thinned the oil too much for workers to recover it - and NOAA officials abandoned the plan. Scientists were meeting Monday night to consider other approaches to the problem.
"They have a whole list of things they're talking about," said Lionel Bryant, a Coast Guard public affairs officer. "By (today), hopefully, they will have decided what else they might be able to do."
About 200 workers continued the cleanup effort Monday along the northern shore of the Fore River, where about 170,000 gallons of oil spilled from the tanker Julie N.
Most of the effort focused on removing oily debris from the shoreline and washing oil from rocks, mudflats and pilings back into the water, where the oil was contained within booms and soaked up with absorbent materials.
Four boat-washing stations remained open, to remove and capture oil from the hulls of fishing boats and pleasure craft that were moored in the harbor during the spill.
In the marsh, Corexit was applied to an area that was fouled on a tide the night of Sept. 28.
Bryant said the solvent removed some of the oil, but the resulting mixture wasn't sticky enough to recover effectively from the water.
Also, tides are running lower now than the night the marsh was fouled, so scientists are having trouble getting deep into the marsh on boats to apply the solvent, he said.
The cleanup crews don't wantto walk in the marsh, Bryant said, because doing that would drive the oil into the soil and cause more environmental damage than leaving it on the grass.
On another front, the state's shellfish-harvesting decision means about 80 square miles of coastline that were closed in the wake of the spill have been reopened to digging for clams, mussels and other shellfish.
Shellfish harvesting remains off-limits in parts of the harbor that were closed prior to the spill because of bacterial contamination.
Also, the inner harbor from Portland Head Light to Mackworth Island remains closed to all types of harvesting, including shellfish and finfish.
The disabled tanker Julie N remained at its berth at the Sprague Energy terminal near the Veterans Memorial Bridge.
Workers spent Monday cleaning out fuel compartments that were damaged when the tanker struck a support under the Portland Bridge.
Bryant, the Coast Guard public affairs officer, said work on the tanker was expected to be finished by Thursday. The owners of the vessel then are expected to submit a salvage plan detailing how the Julie N would be repaired and moved.
Bryant said the plan must be approved by the Coast Guard.
Three more birds were found with oiled feathers Monday and brought to the wildlife rehabilitation center at the National Guard Armory in South Portland.
Eileen Muller, operations manager at the center for Tri-State Bird Rescue, said 11 birds were being treated at the center Monday, and 13 have died to date. Muller said several sea gulls and a black duck are scheduled to be released Thursday. -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------

Abstract: But experts say it could take as little as two years for the environmentally sensitive saltwater marsh to recover from the 170,000-gallon oil spill in Portland Harbor nine days ago. "Even if we don't do anything, if we take no actions, we expect some of the vegetation to grow back nextyear," said Jacqueline Michel of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's oil-spill response team.

Most of the oil coating the shores of the Fore River is the intermediate oil.

Full text: with 2 sidebars oil spill
The tall cordgrass slicked with black, gooey oil in Stroudwater marsh looks as if it is beyond repair.
But experts say it could take as little as two years for the environmentally sensitive saltwater marsh to recover from the 170,000-gallon oil spill in Portland Harbor nine days ago.
"Even if we don't do anything, if we take no actions, we expect some of the vegetation to grow back nextyear," said Jacqueline Michel of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's oil-spill response team.
It is a prediction that is a testament to the healing power of Mother Nature. But there is still cause for concern. The recovery of the complex web of life that is hidden within those grasses will lag somewhat behind.
Although scientists have not yet found large numbers of dead shellfish or other creatures lower on the food chain in the marsh and mudflats, such a discovery wouldn't be surprising.
The heavy coating of oil the area received "is pretty acutely toxic to a lot of the animals in the intertidal zone," Michel said. "If we haven't lost all these animals, we've lost a significant part of them."
Some species will bounce back better than others, perhaps altering the diversity of the Fore River estuary. Birds, for instance, may experience reproductive problems. And shellfish that haven't died may accumulate toxins they could pass on to other animals that eat them.
The tanker Julie N spilled two types of oil: a light fuel oil that evaporates quickly if it's not mixed into the sediments, and an intermediate-weight fuel oil.
Although the lighter oil is more acutely toxic to marine animals, the intermediate oil is more persistent in the environment. Most of the oil coating the shores of the Fore River is the intermediate oil.
While heavier fuel oils can make a marsh "look like hell - they turn it all black and gooey - nevertheless, the plants in the marsh have the ability to regrow through that pretty successfully," said Carl Hershner, chairman of the department of resource management and policy at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Hershner also co-authored the book "Oil Spills in the Marine Environment."
Scientists who have studied the impacts of oil spills the world over say there isn't much that can be done for a fouled tidal marsh, after the initial cleanup.
After that, it is largely up to nature to restore the normal diversity and balance of organisms that live there.
"And there's no way you can mitigate that," Hershner said. "You can't make it get better, and you can't recover the lost productivity of the system."
The oil may kill life forms from algae to snails, mussels, clams and amphipods, the tiny crustaceans that fish eat and shorebirds peck around for in the sand and mud. If it doesn't kill them, it can accumulate in their tissues, especially in the shellfish that wintering waterfowl and gulls like to eat.
Clams can close themselves up for days to survive an oil spill, but over time they, too, can accumulate toxins that can work their way up the food chain.
Fish and other vertebrates fare better: They have enzymes that help break down the oil in their bodies, so unless they get an unusually heavy dose they are less at risk.
So far, the number of animals that were killed immediately by the oil "is pretty limited," said Douglas Helton, oil spill coordinator for NOAA's Damage Assessment Center.
"We haven't seen a lot of dead shellfish washing up or fish kills," he said.
"There are several hundred oiled birds that are still flying around that have not yet become ill enough to be easily captured," Helton continued. "Typically, after a spill, you only find 5 to 20 percent of the birds that are actually killed. You can imagine how hard it is to search some of these marshes."
Birds that aren't killed in the initial aftermath of a spill may have reproductive problems later, or be so stressed physically that they have trouble surviving the coming winter.
"If it was really cold right now we'd have a lot of dead birds, I think," Michel said.
As the estuary heals, the parts that remain unaffected by the spill may be able to help repopulate damaged areas. Fiddler crab larvae surviving in spots free of oil, for example, may provide the seeds for a natural recovery of their populations.
Widespread death of crabs, snails, shellfish and other creatures creates opportunities for other species. Marine worms that tolerate oil well and produce thousands of offspring each year can move in and flourish. Sometimes they become so successful they actually raise the biomass, the measure of the total number of organisms in an area.
As the environment gets cleaner, animals reinvade the area and eventually return it to its original diversity.
In a way, some scientists say, Portland was "inoculated" against an oil spill because of the heavy industrial activity here. Shipping traffic, tank farms, urban runoff and the Fore River's close proximity to the airport have already assured that there are low levels of hydrocarbons in the sediments.
And the presence of those hydrocarbons means there's a healthy population of microbes around to eat the oil from the Julie N.
While it's true that oil can sometimes be found on beaches for decades after a spill, "things generally aren't as bad as people think they are," said Ed Levine, a scientific support coordinator for NOAA.
"You can go back to Valdez (the 11 million-gallon spill off Alaska's coast in 1989) today and find oil, but you're going to have to look hard," he said. "I won't say it's not doing any harm, but it's not readily doing harm."
It could have been worse
Many of those observing and working on the cleanup of the Fore River last week shared a common thought: It could have been worse.
"I think had the spill occurred, say, off Scarborough marsh, it would have been a major environmental disaster," says David Page, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Bowdoin College who has studied oil spills for 22 years with his colleague, Edward Gilfillen.
Page said he thinks that, given the size of the Portland spill, the prognosis is "very good" and that the estuary could recover within two years.
"Where oil spills do damage is where you have a catastrophic spill that really inundates an area," Page said. "In the Amoco Cadiz spill in France (in 1978), there were places where the oil was literally a foot deep. And there were places in the Exxon Valdez spill where the oil was inches deep along the shoreline."
Jacqueline Michel and her colleagues on the NOAA's oil-spill response team are involved in 50 oil spills a year, and actually travel to about a dozen spills a year. Michel spent 250 days in Alaska after the Exxon Valdez spill, traveled to Saudi Arabia during the gulf war ("the worst I've ever been to," she says) and responded to the Block Island Sound spill in Rhode Island last winter.
"There's been very few places where everything's been wiped out," she said. "It's always degrees of disaster."
Portland's spill and its consequences can't really be compared directly to others that have occurred, Michel says, because "every oil spill is different."
The Rhode Island spill contained more than 800,000 gallons of light fuel that mostly damaged inshore bottom-dwelling species and killed a lot of lobsters. There was no shoreline cleanup at all, she said.
In Alaska, only one small marsh was contaminated by oilfrom the Exxon Valdez spill, which dumped crude oil into Prince William Sound. Much of the rocky shoreline there looked more like Schoodic Point, near Acadia National Park, than the Fore River.
Yet the scientific studies that followed the Alaska spill and others have taught scientists important lessons about how to approach such environmental tragedies.
"The No. 1 rule about oil-spill response is you don't make the oil go deeper into the sediment," Michel said. "Once the oil goes deeper in the sediment, you're really extending the recovery time a lot further."
Contaminated sediment means there's less oxygen in the tidal area, and that slows the degradation of the oil.
But at some spills over the years, overzealous cleanup workers have done more harm than good by inadvertently killing plants and pushing oil into the sediment with heavy equipment, or by trampling marsh grasses.
In the Amoco Cadiz spill, 56 million gallons of light Arabian crude oil spilled off the coast of France. Two tidal estuaries were damaged. One was left alone, and oiled vegetation from the other was removed with heavy equipment.
About six years later, Page says, the marsh that was left alone had no trace of oil and had grown in size. The oil had also disappeared from the marsh that had been bulldozed, but it was still struggling to recover.
"The problem was the disturbance," Page said. "There was just nothing there for the plants to grow on. That experience is why they're so careful in the present case because it's sort of the textbook example of cleanup damage in salt marshes."
Scientists directing the cleanup of the Portland spill say they are considering treating some parts of the Stroudwater marsh with a shoreline cleaning agent. Other parts may be cut to protect migrating waterfowl from the remaining oil. And still other parts may be left alone.
"Some people say, `Oh, don't clean up anything, just let nature take care of it. Or cleanup does more harm than good,' " Page said. "But proper and appropriate oil spill cleanup is very important because what you're doing by removing as much of the oil as you can is you're giving nature a head start."
Evaluation begins
Over the weekend, state and federal scientists began evaluating in earnest the full extent of the damage done by the Julie N spill to intertidal plants and animals.
"We're collecting data we think is perishable, things like water samples and tissue samples and wildlife that if we don't collect now we'll lose," said Douglas Helton of the damage assessment team.
The preliminary, emergency work will be done within the next month or so. Then researchers will start designing the long-term studies they'll need to come up with a restoration plan.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, passed after the Exxon Valdez spill, requires the responsible party in an oil spill to pay for the cost of its impact and restoration. Sometime within the next year, the damage assessment team will be putting in a claim on Maine's behalf.
Under the law, even if the damaged area is able to heal naturally, the responsible party must compensate the public for its environmental losses.
"For example, we may decide that it will take two to three or four years for the marsh to recover, and we'll let it recover naturally," Helton said. "The public has lost three or four years of the services provided by that marsh, of the fish production and bird habitat. So the claim for restoration would be to compensate for those lost years of productivity."
That may mean creating new marsh somewhere else in the state, or cleaning up polluted clam flats so they can be opened.
No matter the ultimate outcome, few people could look at the blackened blades of eelgrass in Stroudwater marsh last week and not feel a little sick inside.
"You go to a shoreline that you walked the day before and enjoyed, and now it's coated with this disgusting, black, oily stuff," Page said, "and you want to make it better as quickly as possible.
"And I think, behind this sense of loss and outrage and anger, there's this lingering sense of guilt," Page said. "I feel guilty every time I see an oil spill because I know that every time I turn on my heat or plug in my toaster or get in my car, I'm being part of that implied risk that we take in a petroleum-based society for oil spills."

When a marsh is suddenly flooded with oil, creatures all along the food chain feel its impact. Here is a look at how some of those life forms fare. Raccoons, foxes and other wildlife can roam into the marsh looking for tasty shellfish and other food. An oil spill can take away that food source, but these animals can rebound by foraging in other areas. Wading birds like egrets and great blue herons eat small fish and tiny crustaceans found in salt marshes. Oil spills can kill their food source. And if the birds eat animals that have been contaminated by the oil, they may have reproductive problems or become so stressed that they have trouble surviving the coming winter. Snails, mussels and clams can accumulate toxins that work their way up the food chain. Some marine worms may die, but they are hardy creatures - contaminants pass through those that survive, and they reproduce many offspring to repopulate the area. Fish like mummichogs fare even better: They have enzymesthat help break down the oil in their bodies. Unless they are heavily oiled, they are less at risk. The feathers of ducks and other waterfowl can become covered in oil, either killing them directly or weakening them through stress. The "unnatural oil" from an oil spill degrades the natural oil on a birds' bodies, making them less buoyant in the water and less insulated from the cold. "Dabbler" ducks like the black duck shown above are especially vulnerable to chronic oiling. They spend much of their time in the shallows dipping their heads to feed. Wading bird Great egret stands and waits in the water, or slowly stalks its prey. Feeds on fish, mollusks, insects, small mammals, birds and plants. Like the heron, it is vulnerable to poisoning from tainted fish, crustaceans and mussels it consumes. Grasses Include smooth cordgrass, salt-bay grass, short saltgrass, sea lavender and seaside plantain whose dead blades feed the bacteria, snails and small crustaceans at the bottom of the food chain. The presenceof oil can inhibit this feeding process, ultimately disrupting food production of the entire salt marsh. Mussel Attaches to rocks, pilings between high- and low-tide lines. Can concentrate toxins and pass on to gulls when devoured. Snail This grass "shredder" also feeds on mussels, barnacles and algae. Oil disrupts its ability to find nourishment. Amphipod Lives among seaweed and in mussel beds above and just below the tide line. Also likes rocky edges of freshwater outfalls. Accumulates toxins fromoil and can poison waterfowl.

Abstract: This is a real question for the state of Maine, which receives federal funds every year to use on coastal conservation. The State Planning Office wants your opinion on priorities. The state wants to know, for example, which three of the following issues you consider most important: closed shellfish beds; depleted fish stocks; loss of coastal wetlands; shoreline erosion; too much development in coastal towns; pollution of swimming areas; lack of public access to the coast; trash on beaches; loss of marine-related jobs; or something else.

Full text: Let's say someone gives you $2.2 million to protect the coastal environment of Maine. How would you spend the money?
This is a real question for the state of Maine, which receives federal funds every year to use on coastal conservation. The State Planning Office wants your opinion on priorities.
The state wants to know, for example, which three of the following issues you consider most important: closed shellfish beds; depleted fish stocks; loss of coastal wetlands; shoreline erosion; too much development in coastal towns; pollution of swimming areas; lack of public access to the coast; trash on beaches; loss of marine-related jobs; or something else.
Anyone who wants to participate in the survey should call 287-3261 to request a copy of the one-page questionnaire by mail. People who have access to the Internet may answer the questions on-line through the State Planning Office's home page, www.state.me.us/spo
The deadline for replies is Oct. 21.
Island educators head for Rockland
Teachers, administrators and school board members from the 14 Maine islands that have their own schools will gather Oct. 4-5 in Rockland. Teachers will get a chance to compare notes on problems unique to island schools - such as isolation, transportation, and being the lone teacher in a school.
Doreen Cabot, associate director of Schools & Community Services for the Island Institute, said, "A lot of times, teachers on these islands, especially in the smaller schools, never get off (the island)."
Cabot said she expects 56 people at the conference. Diane Webb from Mid-Coast Family Planning in Rockland will be the keynote speaker. Her lecture, called "Looking at the Whole Student," will touch on issues such as substance abuse, communicating with a child, family life issues, and nurturing environments for children.
There will also be a panel discussion and small group discussions on Webb's speech, as well as many other presentations developed by teachers.

Abstract: Casco Bay fishermen are worried that Maine's reputation for quality seafood will be stained by last week's oil spill long after the cleanup crews have packed up and left. More than 150 fisherman filled a large hall at the Naval Reserve Center on Commercial Street on Sunday afternoon to find out how they might recover from the spill that has forced the closing of some of the area's richest fishing and lobster grounds. All fishing was banned from the Fore River to Great Diamond Island, and taking clams, mussels and quahogs was prohibited from the mouth of the Royal River in Yarmouth to Cape Elizabeth.

Casco Bay fishermen are worried that Maine's reputation for quality seafood will be stained by last week's oil spill long after the cleanup crews have packed up and left.
More than 150 fisherman filled a large hall at the Naval Reserve Center on Commercial Street on Sunday afternoon to find out how they might recover from the spill that has forced the closing of some of the area's richest fishing and lobster grounds.
All fishing was banned from the Fore River to Great Diamond Island, and taking clams, mussels and quahogs was prohibited from the mouth of the Royal River in Yarmouth to Cape Elizabeth.
While the fishermen were assured they could file claims to cover their losses, they were concerned about how the public will react when fin and shellfish from Casco Bay returns to the stores.
Peter McAleney of New Meadows Lobster in Portland said dealers will be careful to make sure the catch is untainted. But he said wary consumers' concerns about quality might be heightened by news of the spill.
Another dealer said newspapers and television stations have "about caused a panic" with intense coverage of the spill.
Fishermen wondered how long the fishing ban would remain in place and others questioned whether it is safe for them to go about their business in areas where fishing is still allowed.
"If it's dangerous for clams and seals, I'm not going in it," said Tollef Olson, who earns about $50,000 diving for urchins. "I don't want a mouthful of it."
The fishermen heard an apology from George Blake, the executive vice president of Maritime Overseas Corp., which owns the tanker that spilled the oil after hitting the Portland Bridge late Friday morning.
"We intend to deal fairly and properly with you," Blake told the fishermen. "If you suffer a loss, you will be quickly and fairly compensated."
But they peppered John Knight, who represents Maritime Overseas' insurer, with questions about how to claim a financial loss from the spill.
Col. Joseph Fessenden of the Maine Marine Patrol said fishermen and state officials will have to work together with Knight to set reasonable levels for compensation.
Lobstermen will have to document their losses by verifying how many traps they have and how many lobsters they catch per trap per day, he said. And they'll have to negotiate a reasonable price per pound - the price at the boat Friday was $2.50 a pound.
"This is something that's new to us and we're not used to handling it," Fessenden said.
Some losses may be easy to document, such as the cost of cleaning affected vessels. That was a relief to Eugene Bellanceau of Windham.
"Our boat was white. It's black now," he said.
While many expressed skepticism about whether their losses will ever be fully covered, some were willing to take it on faith.
Jim Homestead of South Portland figures his losses will easily reach thousands of dollars if the ban stays in place more than a few days. But he said the fact that Fessenden was standing with the insurance representative meant a lot.
"I know Joe Fessenden pretty well," Homestead said. "If he thinks they'lldo well by us, I'll trust them."

CREWS GAIN ON 170,000-GALLON SPILL ROUND-THE-CLOCK CLEAN-UP EFFORTS LIMIT THE DAMAGE FROM A TANKER'S OIL LEAK, BUT OFFICIALS DO RESTRICT SHELLFISHING IN CASCO BAY.

Abstract: Casco Bay was closed to shellfish harvesting Saturday from Falmouth to Cape Elizabeth as officials raised their estimate of Friday's fuel oil spill to 170,000 gallons. The new estimate means Portland suffered its worst oil spill in history Friday when the tanker Julie N hit the PortlandBridge and gushed oil from an 18-foot hole in its hull. Officials originally estimated the spill at 100,000 gallons. Officials on Saturday praised the efforts of more than 300 people who came from all over the East Coast to help contain, vacuum and swab up the spill. By Saturday evening, crews had recovered more than 60,000 gallons of mixed oil and water and the harbor appeared cleaner, the officials said.

Full text: with 8 sidebars oil spill
Casco Bay was closed to shellfish harvesting Saturday from Falmouth to Cape Elizabeth as officials raised their estimate of Friday's fuel oil spill to 170,000 gallons.
The new estimate means Portland suffered its worst oil spill in history Friday when the tanker Julie N hit the PortlandBridge and gushed oil from an 18-foot hole in its hull. Officials originally estimated the spill at 100,000 gallons.
The area's largest previous spill was in 1972, when the tanker Tamano struck Soldier's Ledge in Hussey Sound and leaked more than 100,000 gallons of oil into Casco Bay.
Friday's spill fouled the full five-mile length of the Fore River, blackening grass in the marsh where the Stroudwater River meets the Fore, and forming rainbow slicks off the Eastern Promenade.
The oil most affected wharves along the Portland waterfront, home of the port's seafood dealers and processors. A stiff wind from the south kept the pollution from flowing toward marinas in South Portland.
Officials on Saturday praised the efforts of more than 300 people who came from all over the East Coast to help contain, vacuum and swab up the spill. By Saturday evening, crews had recovered more than 60,000 gallons of mixed oil and water and the harbor appeared cleaner, the officials said.
Still, those in charge of the cleanup remained concerned.
"I think we're still in a critical phase," said David Sait, chief of hazardous-materials response for the state Department of Environmental Protection. "There's still significant oil in the booms. There's still a potential for serious impact both in the river and out of the river."
Booms are the first line of defense in containing a spill. Like floating snakes made of plastic, fiberglass or nylon, they are laid around slicks as enclosures, and may extendseveral feet into the water. But boat traffic or wind-blown waves can cause oil to slop over or slip under a boom.
Gusty winds on Saturday, some up to 28 mph, did allow some oil to escape, Sait said.
The forecast for today promised easier going. The National Weather Service predicted the day will be partly sunny, with winds of only 10 to 15 mph.
Coast Guard Cmdr. Burton Russell, captain of the port, said more cleanup crews were coming to relieve workers who had been on the job more than 24 hours. The accident happened at 11:15 a.m. Friday.
The tanker struck the bridge on its port bow. Russell said the vessel's main rupture, originally estimated as 8 feet long, actually measures 30 feet long by 15 feet deep.
Cause under investigation
The cause of the crash is under investigation. Officials refused to speculate about what might have led the ship to veer into the bridge.
A representative of the company that owns the tanker apologized for the accident at a news conference Saturday.
"We regret the inconvenience it has caused and we are going to do whatever is necessary to try and restore Portland Harbor to what it was before the spill," said George Blake, executive vice president of Maritime Overseas Corp.
Those affected financially by the spill can file claims with the company by calling 1-800-334-3966. Among them no doubt will be many fishermen.
Col. Joseph Fessenden of the Maine Marine Patrol said the state closed the waters at the mouth of Portland Harbor, as far eastas Great Diamond Island, as a precaution while contractors tested lobster and other marine animals for signs of contamination.
He could not estimate how long the ban on fishing would last.
A Portland lobster dealer gasped when he saw a map showing the closed area. "Oh, my god. Oh, my god," said Joey Scola, co-owner of Nancy's Seafood.
Scola said he's already lost 2,600 pounds of lobsters in a holding tank that was polluted by the spill.
"All our pilings are oiled," said Scola, whose business is on Holyoke Wharf.
Mike Wintle, one of 38 lobstermen who supplies Scola, said he probably has 1,500 traps set in the area now closed to fishing.
"We had our biggest week of the season this week, and now this," Wintle said.
Shellfish harvest affected
An even larger area, stretching from Yarmouth to Cape Elizabeth, was closed to the harvest of clams, mussels and quahogs.
But Fessenden said the real effect is not as great as it may seem, because many of the flats already were closed from existing pollution.
Government and independent environmentalists who surveyed the bay for harm to wildlife found very little Saturday.
Joseph Payne, baykeeper of Casco Bay, inspected almost the entire bay Saturday and saw only one oily seagull, by the Fore River near Interstate 295. "It looked like a tiny eagle - all black with a white head," Payne said.
But animals don't have to be coated in oil to be sickened by it. Lois Winter, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,said she expects more potential damage to wildlife over the next few days.
"Some of the birds may have ingested oil. Of course, they don't keel over immediately," she said.
Winter said the timing of the spill was relatively lucky.
"If Casco Bay is a little bit of a desert for wildlife at any time, this is the time," she said. "Many of the wading birds and shorebirds already have left south. And the birds that winter here haven't arrived yet."
Wildlife center planned
Wildlife specialists still plan to set up a rehabilitation center at the South Portland Armory. Winter said plenty of volunteers are on hand to help. She asked that the public not come, to better allow workers to focus on the wildlife.
Payne said he was most disturbed by the presence of oil at Stroudwater, a marshland where the Stroudwater River meets the Fore. This time of year, the marsh attracts feeding gulls, cormorants, great blue herons and gulls, he said.
"If there are oiled birds, they're probably up in the grass," he said.
Overall, spill response leaders said the cleanup and nature already were having a visible effect on the mess.
Coast Guard Cmdr. Russell said that when he flew over Casco Bay Friday, he saw oil slicks east of Great Diamond Island. But on Saturday, the rainbow sheen had evaporated, and oil was visible only as far east as the Eastern Promenade off Portland, he said.
After a boat tour of the Fore River on Saturday, Thomas Valleau, the city's waterfront director, expressed relief.
"I'm very encouraged by how good the harbor looks," he said. "Yesterday I was disheartened, and today I feel a lot better."
Valleau said he hoped that the Scotia Prince, a ferry that makes daily trips from Portland to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, could resume normal operations tonight. The spill forced the ferry to be diverted to Bar Harbor.
He said he was likewise optimistic that a freighter due to pick up cargo at the International Marine Terminal today would be admitted to the harbor and that the IslandBreeze, a cruise ship, could make its regular call on Portland on Tuesday.
Marine traffic restricted
Boat and ship traffic remains restricted from Custom House Wharf west up the Fore River, but Russell said he would admit commercial vessels on a case-by-case basis.
For example, about 15 fishing boats scheduled to unload their catch Saturday at the Portland Fish Exchange were admitted, Russell said, and those boats would be allowed to leave the port to resume fishing, as well.
The spill did not stop all recreational boating Saturday. Several sailboats were visible beyond the mouth of the Fore River. Russell said he also saw windsurfers in Back Cove - and no signs of oil there.
Despite their positive assessment of the cleanup so far, officials acknowledged that the process is slow, laborious, and in the end not all that effective.
"In an average cleanup, you get 10 to 15 percent (of the oil)," said Sait, the DEP spill response chief. "We're way over that now," he said.
By how much he couldn't say. "We're worried about getting it out of the water right now. We'll worry about how much later," he said.
Several workers who came from New Jersey said that for all the expensive equipment employed in the job - booms, skimmers, pumps and so forth - the most important element of cleanup is brute strength and human endurance.
"Strong arms and backs and experience," said Don Zupko, an employee with Marine Spill Response Corp., the company that owns the cleanup ship,the Maine Responder.
Workers seemed to come with a full share of zeal.
Brian House was one of those taking part in the cleanup. The vice president of Clean Harbors arrived from Boston at 10 a.m. Saturday and immediately put on a red hardhat and began hauling the hoses that would pump the spoiled water.
House, his hands and face smudged gray, spent most of the day skimming oil and coordinating the schedules of the 80 men and women deployed by the Massachusetts firm to contain and clean the spill.
Some people who worked 12-hour shifts Saturday volunteered to work longer, but House refused, sending them instead to a local hotel to nap for three or four hours.
"For a lot of people, there's a thrill to this stuff, kind of like a fire department," House said. "But it's not easy. For all the new technology, it's pretty low-tech work. It's not clean and it smells."
One of the less glamorous pieces of equipment is the absorbent pad - diapers, the workers call them. They use the pads to wipe rocks and piers on a sullied shoreline - a painstaking job akin to cleaning the kitchen floor with a Q-tip.
Sait said he could not guess how long cleaning the spill will take. The more that's mopped up, he said, the harder it is to capture what's left.
"It's a matter of diminishing returns," he said. ____________________________________________________________________ __________

OFFICIAL CAUTION
Gawkers flocked to the damaged Portland Bridge on Saturday to check out damage caused by an oil tanker Friday, but officials said some should be more careful.
Bridge workers constantly had to turn back people who climbed over metal gates to take a closer look at the bridge. Authorities said the metal gates are in place for a reason: to keep people safe and away from working areas.
People can walk on both sides of the bridge, but they cannot pass beyond the gates because they might get hurt, said Thomas Doe, an engineer with the Maine Department of Transportation. Doe also cautioned walkers to watch out for official vehicles driving on the bridge. "I think we're still in a critical phase. ... There's still significant oil in the booms. There's still a potential for serious impact both in the river and out of the river." David Sait, Department of Environmental Protection
"We are going to do whatever is necessary to try and restore Portland Harbor to what it was before the spill." George Blake, executive vice president, Maritime Overseas Corp.

Two kinds of fuel oil spilled into Portland Harbor from the tanker Julie N.
About 88,200 gallons was No. 2 fuel oil - a light, refined oil product that will evaporate or naturally disperse within a few days. The rest, about 81,900 gallons, was bunker C, an intermediate fuel oil produced by blending a heavy oil with No. 2 fuel oil.
When spilled on water, No. 2 fuel oil spreads quickly into a thin film, usually about 75 gallons of fuel per square nautical mile. The sheen disperses quickly when winds reach 5 to 7 knots or waves reach 2 to 4 feet.
No. 2 fuel oil is much lighter than water, and therefore does not sink to the sea floor. Heavy waves can mix the fuel into the water, forming small droplets.
When the fuel washes up on the shoreline, it can penetrate porous rocks quickly. But it also can be washed off quickly by waves. As a result, shoreline cleanups often are not needed for small spills.
No. 2 fuel oil decomposes completely, usually in one to two months, as the result of microbial action.
The fuel is highly toxic to water life, but fish kills are unusual after spills in open water because the oil dispersesso quickly.
In shallow water, No. 2 can contaminate lobsters and shellfish. They usually flush the oil out after a few weeks.
The fuel can kill birds. Some deaths are caused by the birds' ingestion of the oil; others die because the fuel mats their feathers and causes drowning and hypothermia.
Bunker C fuel oil - also known as IFO 380 - is known as a "persistent" oil; only 5 to 10 percent evaporates within the first hours of a spill.
When spilled on water, it spreads into thick slicks. Very little of it is likely to mix with the water. It can form thick streamers or, under strong wind conditions, break into patches and tarballs. Some of the oil could sink once it strands on the shoreline, picks up sediment and is eroded by waves.
Bunker C can be viscous and sticky, meaning that stranded oil tends to remain on the surface. Light accumulations usually form a "bath-tub ring" at the high-tide line.
Shoreline cleanup can be effective, particularly soon after the spill and before the oil weathers, becoming stickier and more viscous. Removal is needed quickly, because degradation of heavy oils can take years.
Bunker C is not as toxic to marine life as No. 2 fuel oil, but mortality rates for birds that come in contact with it are high.
Many plants can survive partial oiling, but fewer survive when most of the vegetation is coated with heavy oil. However, the roots often survive and the plants grow back.

Full text: sidebar oil spill
A phone to each ear, Nancy Scola was scrambling in her dockside trailer Saturday to limit the damage that the largest oil spill in Portland's history was inflicting on her business.
With the landing at her lobster and crab dealership stained with oil, Scola was talking to her fishermen, telling them to bring their loads elsewhere.
"It's terrible," Scola said. "And the worst thing is that we don't know when the water will be clean again."
From Cape Elizabeth to Harpswell, hundreds of people in the fishing industry worried about how the 170,000 gallons of oil that spilled from a tanker in Portland Harbor on Friday would affect their livelihoods.
Concerns grew Saturday morning when the state shut miles of coastal waters to lobstermen, fishermen and clammers.
One closure forbids harvesting all marine species in about 10 square miles, stretching from South Portland out to Great Diamond Island and across to Falmouth.
The other closure forbids harvesting clams, mussels and other shellfish in about 80 square miles, reaching up the coast from Cape Elizabeth to the Royal River in Yarmouth and including a number of Casco Bay Islands.
Because of the closures, lobstermen are not allowed to harvest about 5,000 traps in the Portland Harbor area.
And while much of the area closed to shellfishing was already closed because of pollution, clammers worried that strong winds blowing the spill up the coast could force the state to expand the closure area.
"Many people with a business along here will lose money," said Col. Joseph Fessenden, director of law enforcement for the Maine Department of Marine Resources. "We're going to open these areas as quickly as we can, but you have to be wicked conservative when public health is at stake."
Paul Anderson, director of the state's shellfish sanitation program, said the shellfish closure could last months. Officials would not estimate how long the other closure will last, but it is expected to be much shorter.
The state must complete extensive testing of lobsters, clams and other shellfish before it ends the closures. State officials Saturday had already begun collecting lobsters for testing.
Few clammers were hurt by the shellfish closure, because 90 percent of the area already had been closed to shellfish harvesting. Some of the productive areas affected are portions of Broad Cove on the Cumberland coast and some flats around Great Chebeague.
Clammers worried the state might expand the closure in the next few days to Freeport, Brunswick and Harpswell, home to some of the most productive clam flats in the state.
"It's definitely a concern for us guys," said Jim Harriman, a clammer in Freeport, where clamming produces $3.1 million annually. "This is our livelihood. A long closure would do us in."
Anderson said strong winds blowing the oil up the coast could force the state to enlarge the closure.
Fishermen who lose money because of the spill will be eligible to file claims for reimbursement from Maritime Overseas Corp., the company that has claimed responsibility for the spill.
Fishermen are invited to a meeting at the Naval Reserve Center on Commercial Street at 4:30 p.m. today to get an update about the closures and about what they can do about their loses. A representative of Maritime Overseas's insurance company is scheduled to attend the meeting.
State officials expect that meeting will be crowded, as fisherman all along the coast are anxious about their potential losses.
David Hatt, a fisherman who spent Saturday repairing lobster crates on a wharf in Portland Harbor, said most fishermen have a wait-and-see attitude. With Portland Harbor closed, he said, they could only sit around and worry.
"This is going to be devastating for everybody," Hatt said. "It's really a damn shame." MEETING TODAY
The Department of Marine Resources will hold an informational meeting today at 4:30 p.m. for fishermen, businesspeople and others directly affected by the spill.
Also expected to attend the meeting at the Naval Reserve on Commercial Street will be the Coast Guard and the insurance company for the oil tanker, the Julie N. "We're going to open these areas as quickly as we can, but you have to be wicked conservative when public health is at stake." Col. Joseph Fessenden, Dept. of Marine Resources

As oil covered Portland Harbor on Friday afternoon, three seals bobbed through the slick and swam casually around the Maine State Pier.
"I don't know what they think of this oil," said Tim Legg, watching the seals during a break from his job. "I wonder if that's why they're in here, to check it out."
Those who watched the oil pourfrom the hull of the tanker Julie N or saw the sheen of oil as it spread from pier to pier knew wildlife was in danger. But not even the experts could predict the immediate and long-term impacts.
"It breaks my heart to see this, but the reality is it's too early to tell," said Joseph Payne, Casco Bay's baykeeper.
Crews scrambled throughout the day to contain the threat. As the tide ebbed Friday afternoon, booms kept the oil slick from leaving the harbor. As the tide turned, cleanup workers placedbooms above the spill to protect the upper Fore River, Long Creek and the Stroudwater River and their inhabitants - worms, shellfish, fish and shore birds. "These are the nursery areas" of the bay, Payne said.
Too many factors are at play to immediately predict what the oil will do to lobsters, fish or birds, experts said.
"Oil spills are very complicated because different types of oil have different properties in terms of how they float, but also in terms of their toxicity," said Robert S. Steneck, associate professor of oceanography at the University of Maine.
The Julie N spilled heating oil, the smelly, gasoline-like liquid that gave the harbor a rainbow-colored sheen. The heating oil is light and likely to evaporate quickly. It is also highly toxic.
The ship also spilled thicker and stickier oil called Bunker C, which fueled the ship as it steamed from South America to Portland. Much of that was contained around the spill.
"The ones that are real heavy are less toxic, and part ofthat is just that they're gummy," Steneck said. "Short of gooing all over the lobster, they don't get as much into the body."
Generally, lobsters are less affected by an oil spill than other creatures because most live on the ocean bottom rather than in shallow, intertidal zones, Steneck said. If lobsters aren't killed right away, and they have enough oxygen, they "might get off OK," he said.
In the big oil spill off Rhode Island last February, a large storm mixed heavy oil down to the bottom,and thousands of lobsters were lost, Steneck noted. The ones that survived ended up smelling of hydrocarbons, and their market value plummeted to zero. But mixing due to a storm is unlikely to occur in Portland Harbor, he said.
Experts on Friday were looking for waterfowl that could get coated with oil, and plan to search the Fore River this morning.
Richard Dressler, a Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife official who came down from Bangor, said reports varied as to how many birds were coated with oil. One gull was taken to Maine Audubon, which then sent it to Stone Ledge Animal Hospital in Westbrook.
John Kenny, also of Inland Fisheries, said the department called in International Bird Rescue, the state's contractor, and will set up a center for "oiled birds" this morning, perhaps at the South Portland Armory.
Friday afternoon, Roger Hale watched as a lone black cormorant swam through the oil slick near the International Ferry Terminal and dived in the shallows for fish. It flew away toward South Portland, seemingly unfazed.
"That can't be good for him," Hale said.

The most damaging oil spill in Maine's history occurred on July 22, 1972, when the Norwegian tanker Tamano struck Soldier's Ledge as it steamed through Hussey Sound:
More than 100,000 gallons of Bunker C fuel poured into Casco Bay from a 20-foot gash in the hull of the 812-foot vessel.
The spill fouled more than 46 miles of shorefront and 18 islands. The hardest hit was Long Island, on the north side of Soldier's Ledge.
It cost more than $4 million to clean up fouled beaches. Lawsuits seeking damages of more than $115 million were filed by government agencies, island residents, fishermen and environmentalists against the ship, Texaco, the Portland Pilots Association and various others.
Congressional hearings on the incident brought into sharp focus the need for a more comprehensive plan to cope with oil spills.
The methods of reacting to and cleaning up oil spills were fairly primitive at the time.
Planning for the cleanup of the Tamano accident took five days. Officials spent the first day after the spill on the telephone, tracking down the Norwegian owners of the vessel and contacting Department of Environmental Protection officials and clean-up operators.
Then-Gov. Kenneth M. Curtis said at the time that there was "both a lack of equipment and a jurisdiction problem."
There was no organization in place to respond to oil spill emergencies and begin the cleanup immediately. The delay allowed the oil slick to reach shore, which makes the oil much more difficult to retrieve.
The damage from the spill was immense and long-lasting. Casco Bay tidal flats were not officially deemed free of oil pollution until 11 years later, in August 1983, and even then, shellfishing remained closed in some areas.
More than $1.5 million was paid by the ship's owners to settle damage claims filed after the spill, including about $600,000 to clam diggers and their lawyers. PORTLAND OIL SPILLS
Here are some of the largest oil spills in Portland Harbor:
November 1963 - The Liberian tanker Northern Gulf, bound for Portland Pipe Line pier in South Portland, ran aground on West Cod Ledge, three miles off Cape Elizabeth, spilling25,000 barrels of oil. A barrel is 42 gallons.
Dec. 16, 1969 - A Yugoslav tanker, Rade Koncar, spilled an undisclosed amount into the harbor while discharging 441,000 barrels of crude oil at Portland Pipe Line.
October 1970 - Between 30,000 and 40,000 gallons spilled into the harbor from a barge.
April 1971 - The Orient Star, a Liberian tanker, spilled about 15 barrels into Portland Harbor from the Portland Pipe Line terminal. It was the first ship in Portland to be fined under the federal Water QualityImprovement Act of 1970.
Feb. 1, 1972 - About 4,500 gallons of Bunker C fuel oil spilled near the Portland Bridge from the coastal tanker Captain Sam of New York City.
July 22, 1972 - The 812-foot Norwegian oil tanker Tamano struck Soldier's Ledge in Hussey Sound and spilled 100,000 gallons of No. 6 fuel oil, also known as bunker C fuel. More than 46 miles of shorefront and 18 islands were affected by the spill. The cost of the cleanup exceeded $4 million.
Feb. 26, 1979 - Approximately 550 gallons of diesel fuel spilled out of the tanker Thalassani Tyhi, which was offloading crude oil at the Portland Pipe Line.
Dec. 19, 1980 - Approximately 10,000 gallons spilled into the Fore River out of a leaky valve on the 674-foot tanker Saroula, of New York City, which was offloading at Northeast Petroleum in South Portland.
Oct. 30, 1983 - Between 2,000 and 3,000 gallons of No. 6 crude oil spilled from the Greek tanker Dynamikos and washed ashore at Spring Point, House Island and Cushing Island.

Vientiane Thai Food and Asian Market Place

The bottom line: Vientiane Thai Food and Asian Market Place has been going strong with a simple formula ever since the folks there bought out Batambong about eight years ago: Serve up great, cheap Vietnamese dishes for lunch and dinner takeout, and provide the Asian-cooking faithful with a basic grocery store.
You've probably read about the place before, but about a month ago some changes occurred that have expanded the restaurant side of the business.
These days, Vientiane lets diners sitin. With four tables and seating for 12, it's no longer just a takeout place. It's a homey, sit-in-the-back-of-the-store kind of place, just a divider away from the bags of jasmine rice and coconut milk. And the cook has changed, too.
Until recently, an independent cook affiliated with Seng Takeout on Congress Street rented space from the Vientiane owners. Now the Vientiane owners cook the food. Believe it: The menu is as fresh and varied and tasty as ever, with only the very slightest in flavor variations and no loss of quality. But the portions are somewhat smaller.
We had spring rolls ($3.25) to start, broccoli in oyster sauce ($5.50), garlic chicken ($5.50) and a special, Yum shrimp ($7.50).
Vientiane offers appetizers ranging from $3.25 to $4.95, soups at $1.95 or $2, and several entrees priced at $5 to $5.50, including Pad Thai, that all-time Vietnamese favorite.
Vientiane remains better than ever taste-wise, but we would have loved to see more on our plates.

Maine led the Northeast in commercial fishing revenues in 1995, setting records in the value and volume of harvested marine life.
Government figures released Tuesday show that the fishing industry remains robust and continues to shift from once-traditional species such as cod that have become scarce in New England waters.
Though the groundfish sector has shrunken significantly, those losses have been more than compensated for in Maine by the growing worth of four other fisheries: lobster, farmed salmon, sea urchins and shrimp.
Fishermen and aquaculturists collectively grossed $273.6 million on 253.6 million pounds of fish last year, all-time highs in worth and weight, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. Fishermen harvested 57 types of finfish, shellfish and seaweed.
"The good news in terms of the Maine fishery is that we have the capacity to be diversified," said Penn Estabrook, state deputy commissioner of marine resources. "That (gives) the fishing industry a much stronger hand than elsewhere."
For the second year in a row, Maine ranked first among 10 East Coast states in revenues earned by fishermen and fish farmers. Until 1994, Massachusetts was always first. Other states listed are: New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.
Maine's fishing industry has long been touted as diverse and flexible. However, players in the business and analysts have been anticipating a downturn in overall landings because of a crisis in the groundfishery, which faces tight restrictions to correct overfishing.
A mainstay of New England commerce since colonial times, the groundfishery clearly is in decline. Three staples of the region's diet - cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder - together fetched $35.8 million in 1995, 38 percent less than in 1993.
"That big a decline in two years - that's off the cliff," said Charles Colgan, an economist at the University of Southern Maine.
Codfish landings in Maine slid from 7 million pounds, worth $7.7 million, in 1994 to 4.5 million pounds, worth $5 million, in 1995. Two years ago, it was the state's fifth most- valuable fishery; now it is ninth.
The open question is whether the groundfish slump - which almost certainly will continue as a result of new rules meant to curtail landings - will be profound enough to influence the industry as a whole.
So far, it has not been. But no one is breathing easy yet.
"Every year, people basically don't know what to expect and they're doing the best they can to prepare for the worst," said Dennis Frappier,general manager of the Portland Fish Exchange, an auction house that last year handled 40 percent of the fish landed in Maine's largest port.
The growth in commercial fishery revenues, which has continued for five straight years, likely will not go on, said Colgan.
"I'm optimistic about fishing as an enterprise, that it will stay a viable enterprise, but I have no illusions that it will always be as prosperous as it is this year," he said.
A big part of the prosperity is attributable to the four most-valuable species, which together accounted for 75 percent of the state's revenues. Each of those species - lobster, farmed Atlantic salmon, sea urchins and shrimp - are considered in somewhat precarious positions, biologically.
For example, federal biologists warn that lobster is overfished. While some scientists and lobstermen are skeptical about that, the industry generally is nervous about escalating harvests. Landings virtually doubled between 1984 and 1994, reaching a plateau last year at 37.2 million pounds.
The volume of salmon sold from Maine farms has more than doubled since 1991, to 22 million pounds, but the industry faces aggressive competition from growers in Chile and Norway.
"We're in serious trouble if this continues," said Joe McGonigle, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Association.
McGonigle said deep price cuts by the foreign fish farmers probably won't eradicate the Maine industry but could change the way it operates.
"What you'll see is a couple of large farms consolidating production (to cut costs), and they'll become extremely large," he said.
As for the sea-urchin sector, landings have fallen for two years in a row, though the value of the fishery has continued to climb.
Shrimp fishing, which has boomed for two winters now, probably will be good for only one more season, according to biologists who study the abundance of shrimp in the sea.
Estabrook, the deputy marine resources commissioner, said the real value of Maine fisheries ismore than what shows at the cash register.
"It's more than a gross state product, because of the cultural aspects," he said. ". . . It's part of the fabric (of Maine)."

PRIZED EUROPEAN OYSTER GROWS FAT IN OUR ESTUARIES MAINE SHELLFISH FARMERS KNOW FRANCE'S BELON OYSTER COMMANDS HIGH PRICES IN THE RIGHT PLACES.

Abstract: The highly prized Belon oyster is what Spinney Creek grows to market size. The Belon is a flat oyster, originally from the mouth of the Loire River in France. According to James Peterson's "Fish and Shellfish," the "best American `Belons' come from Maine and northern California, where the cold water gives them a delicious briny, almost metallic flavor." At one time, in the mid-1980s, Belon oysters escaped from their aquaculture nurseries in Casco Bay and "started setting (growing) by themselves all over Casco Bay, and a lot of clam diggers were diving on the Belon with a lot being sent to Europe," said [Tom] Howell. "Some people think disease or cold weather killed them off." "There are four or five" shellfish companies that grow oysters right up to market size on the Damariscotta River, said Chris Malone, hatchery manager for Mook Sea Farm in Walpole. Mook raises seed oysters, including the Belon, to send off to other shellfish growers, who grow them on to eating size. The company has oyster nurseries on the Damariscotta River and another in Maquoit Bay, off Brunswick.

"This is the best growth time for oysters. They are done spawning and paying attention to putting fat in the bodies," says Tom Howell, general manager of Spinney Creek Shellfish in Eliot.
Most growers start the small seed oysters in floating trays, says Howell. "Then they go into boxes with mesh that hold very small oysters, then a wider screen. When they are one or two inches in size, they are moved into `leased bottoms' - which are the floors of estuaries and tidal waters."
The highly prized Belon oyster is what Spinney Creek grows to market size. The Belon is a flat oyster, originally from the mouth of the Loire River in France. According to James Peterson's "Fish and Shellfish," the "best American `Belons' come from Maine and northern California, where the cold water gives them a delicious briny, almost metallic flavor."
Spinney Creek sells about 200,000 Belons a year to a very select, high-end market, mostly in New York City.
"You need to reach sophisticated oyster bars and palates that have a lot of money," says Howell, who adds that the Grand Central Oyster Bar in Manhattan is a big customer. Belons are going for about 60 to 80 cents apiece wholesale, says Howell.
At one time, in the mid-1980s, Belon oysters escaped from their aquaculture nurseries in Casco Bay and "started setting (growing) by themselves all over Casco Bay, and a lot of clam diggers were diving on the Belon with a lot being sent to Europe," said Howell. "Some people think disease or cold weather killed them off."
Oyster aquaculture in Maine is a small but important part of the fishing industry.
"There are four or five" shellfish companies that grow oysters right up to market size on the Damariscotta River, said Chris Malone, hatchery manager for Mook Sea Farm in Walpole. Mook raises seed oysters, including the Belon, to send off to other shellfish growers, who grow them on to eating size. The company has oyster nurseries on the Damariscotta River and another in Maquoit Bay, off Brunswick.
PERHAPS THE BEST-LOVED way of eating oysters is in a stew. Here's a simple recipe from "Merrymeeting Merry Eating" published by the Mid Coast Hospital Brunswick Auxiliary in Brunswick.
Grand Central Station
Oyster Bar Oyster Stew
1 teaspoon Worcestershire
sauce
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon celery salt
2 tablespoons butter, divided
7 freshly opened oysters

FOR A SNAZZY oyster presentation, here's something on the half shell from "Maine Ingredients," by The Junior League of Portland:
Elegant Oysters
24 oysters, on the half shell
1 cup Hollandaise sauce (recipe
below)
2 large shallots, finely chopped
1/2 cup champagne
fresh dill for garnish
Preheat boiler. Loosen oysters in their shells. Arrange oysters on a large ovenproof pan and set aside.
Prepare the Hollandaise sauce. Add the shallots and champagne. Stir well. Spoon the sauce over each oyster. Place oysters under the broiler for about 2 minutes. Garnish with fresh dill and serve immediately. Serves 4to 6.
Hollandaise Sauce
6 tablespoons butter
4 egg yolks
juice of 1 lemon
salt and pepper to taste
In a small saucepan, heat butter until it just starts to smoke but not to burn. In blender or food processor, combine egg yolk, lemon salt and pepper. With the motor running, slowly pour the hot butter into the egg yolk mixture. If mixture curdles, add a few drops of water. Pour sauce into saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until egg starts to cook to sides of pan. Pour back into blender or food processor to smooth out.

Full text: No creature evokes images of sea and shore like the lovely sea star, the "starfish" of childhood memory. In Maine, the northern sea star is the common species; indeed, around some mussel shoals, one sweep of the eye might take inseveral hundred.
Several other species share its range, notably the thicker-armed Forbes' common sea star, which largely replaces it south of Cape Cod. Both are fond of bi- valve mollusks such as the blue mussel.
Though orange or light purple may be the northern sea star's primary colors, it can be half a dozen other colors as well. Sometimes the tips of its five arms all are curved in the same direction like some aquatic pinwheel. Tide pools, rock or gravel bottoms, sandy shores all hold their share, though it is also common around city wharves and pilings.
Look for it between high- and low-tide lines. From Labrador to Cape Hatteras, it brings out the child in all of us.

Abstract: Cove by cove, stretches of previously closed clam flats in Maine have become open to diggers in recent years. Some say it's a sign of cleaner water and less pollution. Shellfish officials in Freeport plan to open the last 200 acres of clam flats closed by old household sewage systems. Areas in Harpswell and Phippsburg and Wiscasset have also been approved for clamming. And about 1,000 acres of mudflats near Rockland were opened recently because of a new sewage treatment plant on the St. George River.

Full text:   Cove by cove, stretches of previously closed clam flats in Maine have become open to diggers in recent years. Some say it's a sign of cleaner water and less pollution.
In Casco Bay, in 1993, 44.5 percent of the bay's flats were closed. By 1995, the percentage of closed flats had dropped to 37 percent.
"What it means to me is progress and success and I hope that percentage closed continues to decline," said Paul Anderson, director of the shellfish sanitation program for the state Department of Marine Resources.
Shellfish officials in Freeport plan to open the last 200 acres of clam flats closed by old household sewage systems. Areas in Harpswell and Phippsburg and Wiscasset have also been approved for clamming. And about 1,000 acres of mudflats near Rockland were opened recently because of a new sewage treatment plant on the St. George River.
The ratio of open to closed clam flats is considered an environmental benchmark of how clean the water is.
In the late 1980s, the federal government began using stricter criteria for classifying shellfish areas. Those changes were so severe that many states had to close areas and put in new programs, said Anderson.
"Now, what we're seeing is the fruits of our labors. Our databases are flush with water quality data," he said.
In 1991, when Mick McGivaren began sampling the water in the Harraseeket River in Freeport, 70 percent of the flats were closed. Now - after those last 200 acres are opened - 98 percent of the flats will be deemed safe for digging.
"I'm seeing cleaner waters," said McGivaren. "Everybody's much more sensitive to the cleanliness of our waters and our shores."
But, while agreeing that the numbers indicate progress on the environmental front, others cautioned that there are other reasons for clam flats re-opening and there's still more to do.

SURVEY: CATERPILLARS CAUSE MISERY FOR MANY ISLANDERS CITY OFFICIALS ARE HOPING THE SURVEY'S RESULTS WILL PROVE TO THE STATE THAT AERIAL SPRAYING IS JUSTIFIED.

Abstract: The tiny hairs of the browntail moth caterpillar have caused health problems for most property owners on Portland's Casco Bay islands, according to a newly completed survey. Survey results will go to the state Board of Pesticide Control and state legislators from this area, said George Flaherty, Portland's manager for island affairs. City officials hope that if they can prove the caterpillars are a health threat, Portland will get state permission for wider spraying of the pesticide Dimilin. In May, with property owners' permission, the city hired a crop duster to spray the pesticide over parts of Peaks, Great Diamond and Cushing islands. The same contractorsprayed two privately owned islands, Clapboard and Sturdivant, and parts of Falmouth on the mainland.

Full text:   The tiny hairs of the browntail moth caterpillar have caused health problems for most property owners on Portland's Casco Bay islands, according to a newly completed survey.
The survey, issued by the city in late June and completed last week, shows that 84 percent of those responding have experienced skin rashes because of the caterpillars. Twenty-one percent said they had had respiratory problems.
Survey results will go to the state Board of Pesticide Control and state legislators from this area, said George Flaherty, Portland's manager for island affairs. City officials hope that if they can prove the caterpillars are a health threat, Portland will get state permission for wider spraying of the pesticide Dimilin.
In May, with property owners' permission, the city hired a crop duster to spray the pesticide over parts of Peaks, Great Diamond and Cushing islands. The same contractorsprayed two privately owned islands, Clapboard and Sturdivant, and parts of Falmouth on the mainland.
Dimilin is considered harmless to humans and other mammals, birds and fish. But some island residents, particularly on Peaks, oppose its use because it can harm lobsters and other shellfish and because its long-term effects on human health and the environment are unknown.
Because of the opposition on Peaks Island - the bay's most populous island - only the island's southwest corner was sprayed. That ensured that the pesticide could not drift onto properties where owners didn't want it.
Residents in areas that weren't sprayed have continued to suffer from the caterpillars this summer.
Portland's survey was distributed to 1,552 people on islands that are part of Portland. More than 1,220 people, 79 percent, responded.
That strong response alone should be interpreted as a widespread plea for broader, more effective measures against the browntail, said Cathy V. Brigham, a nurse who helped conduct the survey for the city's Public Health Division.
The survey shows that 84 of every 100 respondents suffered from skin rashes caused by the caterpillar hairs. The problem occurs principally in June and July, the season in which the caterpillars mature.
The survey also found that 21 percent of respondents experienced breathing problems that they believed were caused by the caterpillar. That rate is twice the average occurrence of respiratory problems in the population at large, Brigham said. It clearly suggests that something is exacerbating breathing ailments on the islands.
The caterpillar hairs carry a toxin that has plagued islanders each summer for at least two years. The hairs get airborne and either drift against exposed skin or fall on items that people handle.
Some people react so violently to the caterpillar toxin that hospital emergency treatment and prescription steroids have been necessary to counter the reaction.
On the survey section reserved for comments, "A good 75 percent of the respondents were just begging the city to spray the area next year," Brigham said. Some people even included photographs of their red, raised, itchy rashes.
Nina Kidwell, a nurse at the Peaks Island Health Center, said that at the height of the browntail season this summer, as many as one-third of her patients had caterpillar-related problems.
"It seems like the reactions are increasing in severity, the rash, breathing problems, itching," Kidwell said.
Flaherty said Portland sponsored its survey after state authorities were reluctant earlier this year to approve aerial spraying.
That reluctance was based on uncertainty about the extent and nature of the health problems. Flaherty said the survey provides the documentation that local legislators will need to seek state approval for aerial spraying.
But permission for wider spraying could be denied by the state, even if the browntail is judged to be a serious threat to public health.
Paul Gregory, a spokesman for the pesticide control board, said state regulations forbid applying pesticides if there is any possibility that the chemicals could spread onto property that owners want kept free of pesticides.
Illustration MAP: Casco Bay; Caption: Staff art Where the moths are Areas of Casco Bay that were aerially sprayed in May with the chemical Dimilin appear to have escaped the ravages of the browntail moth this year. Infested areas that weren't sprayed - including most of Peaks Island - are paying a toll in defoliation and human discomfort. Browntails have been seen as far south as Kittery and as far north as Port Clyde, but the infestation is worst in and around Casco Bay. Areas that were sprayed: Sturdivant Clapboard Portland Country Club and adjacent property Great Diamond Cushing p.10A

Abstract: LeBlanc's Food Enterprises Inc. of Presque Isle is hours from the coast. Yet its lobster stew has become so popular customers are ordering it from as far away as Alaska, said Patty LeBlanc, the company's founder. The stew used to be one menu item - among many others - at Winnie's Restaurant and Dairy Bar in Presque Isle, an Aroostook County landmark that LeBlanc and her husband bought in 1988. Gradually, the stew emerged as a standout. Customers flying out of the nearby regional airport would ask the LeBlancs to pack the stew in gallon jugs to go. After they had eaten their ration, they'd write, wanting more.

Full text: It's a delicious irony: In the heart of Maine's potato country, a gourmet food company is building its reputation around lobster stew.
LeBlanc's Food Enterprises Inc. of Presque Isle is hours from the coast. Yet its lobster stew has become so popular customers are ordering it from as far away as Alaska, said Patty LeBlanc, the company's founder.
The stew used to be one menu item - among many others - at Winnie's Restaurant and Dairy Bar in Presque Isle, an Aroostook County landmark that LeBlanc and her husband bought in 1988.
Gradually, the stew emerged as a standout. Customers flying out of the nearby regional airport would ask the LeBlancs to pack the stew in gallon jugs to go. After they had eaten their ration, they'd write, wanting more.
Even Gov. Angus King and his wife, Mary Herman, are fans, said Phyllis Siebert, the first couple's chef. They serve the stew at the Blaine House, out of a silver tureen rescued from the watery grave of the sunken battleship Maine.
LeBlanc's mum on the recipe for the stew - not surprising since she's hoping to sell $100,000of the product this year. But the secret, she allows, is not to skimp on the lobster.
LeBlanc buys her crustaceans from Maine Shellfish in Ellsworth, about 190 miles away from her restaurant. In addition to lobster meat, she puts milk, cream, butter, water, sugar, pepper and "secret" spices into her stew. Her 20 employees make 30 quarts of stew every day at the restaurant.
LeBlanc traces her love of cooking to her girlhood in 4-H. Later, she was in women's extension groups and did some cake decorating and catering on the side.
"It just developed," said LeBlanc, an Aroostook County native, "and I said, `I should really be in the food business.' "
LeBlanc sells the stew by the bowl at Winnie's. Cartons of frozen stew are available at two Presque Isle grocery stores and in the gift shops of several restaurants. But LeBlanc's main method of distribution is mail order: She's sent 450 orders out next-day airmail.
Next month, LeBlanc will get to pitch her stew on a new medium, to a much broader audience. She was among 44 vendors - out of some 500 applicants - chosen to appear on a QVC program featuring Maine products.
Marjie Wright, a researcher at the Maine Office of Tourism who is working with officials from the cable TV shopping channel, said LeBlanc was the only Aroostook County entrepreneur chosen.
Wright said LeBlanc, the bubbly former director of the Presque Isle Chamber of Commerce and the local United Way, impressed QVC officials both with her stew and her personality.
At a vendor trade show, Wright said, "I don't think she was there five minutes and everyone knew who she was."
And the stew? "It's heavenly," said Wright. "It's to swoon over."

AS MAINE GOES THE TALE OF THE STATE'S MANY OUTHOUSES IS NOT ALWAYS PRETTY, BUT IT'S PRETTY AMUSING.

Abstract: The 1990 Census found that roughly 19,000 Maine houses lack public sewers, septic tanks or cesspools. Presumably, most residents of those houses rely on privies year-round. One of them is Carolyn Chute, author of "The Beans of Egypt Maine," who claims that "all the great people . . . all the statesmen" used outhouses. Outhouses seem to inspire more sentimentality as fewer people use them daily. Freeport gift shops stock outhouse postcards. Privies are celebrated in poems and songs. In his "Ode to the Little Brown Shack Out Back," Billy Edd Wheeler, the West Virginia country songwriter, fondly recalls the last outhouse in town: Earlier this year, Pownal tore down a two-story outhouse attached to the rear of its town hall.

Full text: with sidebar outhouse
Mention outhouses, and most people crinkle up their noses in disgust. Not Alix Kates Shulman.
Shulman, a writer who splits her time between New York City and an island near Portland, sings the praises of her oceanside outhouse in her latest book, "Drinking the Rain."
"Using this privy is one of the day's most satisfying interludes," she writes. ". . . I can watch the swallows feeding their young in the rafters, or follow a marsh hawk glide in low easy loops around the nubble as it hunts field mice. From this pew I have marked the progress of the seasons in the flower-crammed brush: fiddleheads and berry blossoms in early spring, wild roses, nightshade, and touch-me-nots in summer, goldenrod and pale purple asters now, in fall."
More than two centuries after an English cabinetmaker patented the flush toilet, outhouses remain an integral part of Maine's landscape. Each summer, thousands of people use the wooden outhouses at state parks, camps and remote cabins.
The 1990 Census found that roughly 19,000 Maine houses lack public sewers, septic tanks or cesspools. Presumably, most residents of those houses rely on privies year-round. One of them is Carolyn Chute, author of "The Beans of Egypt Maine," who claims that "all the great people . . . all the statesmen" used outhouses.
Outhouses seem to inspire more sentimentality as fewer people use them daily. Freeport gift shops stock outhouse postcards. Privies are celebrated in poems and songs. In his "Ode to the Little Brown Shack Out Back," Billy Edd Wheeler, the West Virginia country songwriter, fondly recalls the last outhouse in town:
"Its doors were never shut,
And a man could get inside without a dime."
Earlier this year, Pownal tore down a two-story outhouse attached to the rear of its town hall. Alan Bradstreet, aPownal woodworker, is using lumber salvaged from the outhouse to make Christmas tree ornaments and refrigerator magnets. They're shaped like privy doors, with a crescent moon hole. Townspeople have sold several hundred, at $3.50 each, to raise money for an addition to town hall.
Some prospective customers want to know exactly where in the outhouse the wood came from. "I assure them we have very sanitary ornaments and magnets," says Bradstreet. "It only comes from the cleaner parts of the inside walls."
Ben Franklin's secrets
Long the butt of jokes, the humble outhouse now is drawing attention from folklorists and historians. At least one Maine outhouse, a double-decker connected to the Bridgewater Town Hall, has earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places.
Archaeologists are digging up old privies to learn about the diets and habits of earlier generations. "The excavation of privies is a very sexy thing now," says James Hewat, an architectural historian at the Maine Historic Preservation Commission. ". . . They're gold mines in terms of information."
If it seemed like an invasion of privacy when A.J. Weberman rummaged through Bob Dylan's trash and wrote about its content, consider the fate of poor Benjamin Franklin.
Archaeologists dug up two privies behind his Philadelphia home. They uncovered pieces of jars, mugs, pie plates, beef bones and oyster shells.
In Maine, archaeologists last year dug at Winslow's Fort Halifax. Built in 1754, it is the oldest blockhouse in the United States. They discovered what they believe to be the officer's privy there, containing medicine bottles, pottery shards and clay pipes, says Hewat.
Standing privies have attracted interest as examples of folk architecture.
"They are natural, though often slight; their virtue is intimately related to the environment and to the heart-life of the people," remarked Frank Lloyd Wright.
Maine boasts a wide variety of architectural styles, including one-holers, two-holers and an eight-holer at a lumber camp near Allagash Lake.
Double-decker outhouses were popular in cold climates like Maine because they could be reached even in deep snow. George Hannum, a state outdoor recreation planner, says he once saw a three-story outhouse on a barn in Monmouth.
John Calvin Stevens, Maine's foremost architect of the late 19th century, drew up plans in 1899 for what must have been one of Maine's fanciest privies. Sheathed in cedar shingles, the privy at Brown Memorial Library in Clinton featured a saltbox roof and arched windows.
A haven for spiders
Generations of children have worried about what lurked in the dark holes of outhouses. Stories abound about snakes, rats and other creatures nipping unsuspecting users on the behind.
Eunice deSanchez says children used to be so afraid of the dark, wooden two-holer at her summer home on Cousins Island that they relieved themselves in the woods instead. Her son made her go with him each time and check for spiders.
Several years ago, she decided to spruce it up. She painted the walls white. She tacked up pictures of cats, and a sign saying, "Smile, You're on `Candid Camera.' " Her father installed toilet seats and covers.
That did the trick. "Not that it's inviting at all," she admits, "but it made it much more pleasant." And the children no longer fled for the woods.
Bustins Island in Freeport also sports some fancy outhouses. Many summer residents of the rustic island have only privies. They've decorated them with lobster pots, fresh flowers and old "wanted" posters from the post office.
Birdfeeders hang outside the outhouses at Little Lyford Pond Camps near Greenville. But using them in the dead of a Maine winter can be a painful ordeal, admits Kate Fackelman.
Fackelman and her husband, Bud, run the century-old logging camp, where guests come to fish, snowmobile and cross-country ski. The only toilet facilities are outdoors. When the temperature plummets to 40 below, "it's a quick trip," says Fackelman, whoreports no problems with teen-agers hogging the bathroom.
Fackelman says it can be difficult to persuade prospective visitors to pay $85 a day (meals included) for a log cabin with no indoor plumbing.
But once they arrive, she says, "Most of them are amazed that (the outhouses) are as comfortable and aesthetically pleasing as they are."
The work of heroes
(Reader advisory: The rest of this story contains information that could be difficult to digest over Sunday breakfast.)
Forgive Chris Wolfe of Freeport if she's not sentimental about outhouses. After all, she has the dirty work of cleaning them.
What's remarkable is that she does it for free.
Wolfe, 54, a retired L.L. Bean manager, serves on the board of managers for the Maine Appalachian Trail Club. She oversees the Bigelow district, one of the most heavily-used stretches of the trail in Maine.
Dealing with human waste in the fragile, mountain environment is a constant challenge. The outhouses are miles from the nearest road, so they can't be pumped out. Much of the work of building and maintaining them falls to volunteers like Wolfe.
"To the neophyte, the work is disgusting," states an Appalachian Mountain Club report on a new composting system. "To the veteran, it's the work of heroes."
Wolfe clearly is one of the heroes. She's so dedicated that she appraises outhouses even when she's not on duty.
"When I'm hiking," she says, "I always go into a privy and look down and see how high the pile is."
She also has a good sense of humor.
Wolfe built one privy on the trail named Your Move, which has a cribbage board between the two holes. Another, called Fort Relief, is a log cabin with curtains on the windows and a mirror on the wall. It's so roomy that people have camped there in bad weather.
The Maine Appalachian Trail Club has experimented over the years with different systems for composting human waste. In 1982, the club helped install a solar outhouse at Horns Pond campsite in the Bigelows.
The "Solar One-Holer" uses heat from the sun to speed the decomposing of solid waste. It has worked reasonably well, but composting takes a year and a half. The solar privy couldn't keep up with the volume of use at its site. Buying two new outhouses would cost a whopping $40,000.
Instead, Wolfe helped install a "batch/bin" privy system at the site this spring. Urine drains into a collecting barrel, where it's filtered through fine coal. Feces are mixed with bark chips. Wolfe details the process as if she were giving a recipe:
"Put (the feces) into a mixing bin. Add more bark chips, for a 3:1 ratio" of chips and waste. "You have to mix it then, so that you break down all the clumps of feces."
Wolfe says that this is the stinky part. She copes by making jokes about what each person ate.
The mixture then is poured into a stainless steel "cooking bin," where it heats up, gets stirred and heats again, four or five times. Finally, it's set on a drying rack. The fine soil that drops through the rack can be thrown in the woods.
Wolfe concedes that the system is very labor-intensive. But the waste can be composted in only about two months.
Best of all, she says, the privy "doesn't smell like an outhouse." ALL ABOUT OUTHOUSES
The word "privy" comes from the Latin "privatus," or private. Euphemisms include throne, post office, Johnnie, stool, roadside rest and White House.
Before the mid-1800s, a crescent moon hole on an outhouse door meant it was for women. A sunburst cutout meant it was for men.
Corncobs, dress patterns, mail-order catalogues and newspapers all served as early toilet paper.
"Night-soil men" would dig up waste from city outhouses and remove it, usually at night.
A common prank on the Fourth of July or Halloween was to move an outhouse into the middle of town, or to tip it over.
Until 1974, outhouses were virtually unregulated in Maine. Anyone constructing an outhouse now must get a permit from the Department of Human Services.
Executives fromMotorola, Xerox and other, large companies are among those who have used the eight-hole privy at the Outward Bound school on Hurricane Island, known because of its smell as the Elephant House. The corporate moguls also have taken turns cleaning it.

Full text: It is the archetypal American beast, found from coast to coast and border to border, spilling over into Canada and Mexico but barely, a true "native" born and bred. The Yankee raccoon looks like a Californian raccoon or any other version,with its telltale features of ample girth, black mask and ringed tail.
A raccoon mother often is seen now, either by the backyard light or in early morning, trailing two or more youngsters behind. The latter are only slightly smaller than she by this time, having been born in April or May. The family will stay together at least until fall and perhaps until the onset of winter.
The water-loving raccoon is in its element in Maine. The shores of any watercourse are abundant with food possibilities, and the raccoon dines widely. Audubon wrote of its penchant for "muscles" (mussels), observing that the habits of these mollusks "are better known to the Raccoon than to most conchologists, and their flavour is as highly relished by this animal as is that of the best bowl of clam soup by the epicure in that condiment."
In town and country, it prowls nightly, pulling smiles from all who know it.

Full text: Sun lovers may be chaffing at this summer's all-too-frequent dampness, but the chanterelles, the matsutakes and the boletus are in their element.
July's cloud-darkened skies, fog and rain have produced a bumper crop of mushrooms sprouting in the woods, in fields and on suburban lawns. With the soggy weather expected to continue into August, mushrooms should continue to flourish.
That's welcome news for mushroom enthusiasts.
"This is a record year. I've had more mushrooms this year than ever," said Candice Heydon, owner of Oyster Creek Mushroom Co. in Damariscotta. "We're probably the only people hoping Maine will have another gray, rainy day."
Heydon buys wild mushrooms from independent harvesters and sells them to restaurants and grocery stores. She also cultivates gourmet shitake mushrooms on oak logs behind her house.
But Heydon and other experts warn that not all wild mushrooms are there for the eating. Some can cause illness and even death if eaten.
The boom in mushroom growth this summer has prompted a flurry of telephone calls to the poison control emergency line at Maine Medical Center, said Dr. Anthony Thomasone of the hospital's Poison Control Center. Most of the calls are from parents reporting that a child has eaten an unfamiliar wild mushroom species, he said.
"Most of them aren't poisonings; they're ingestions," Thomasone said. "There are probably about 6,000 or more kinds of fungus that grow around the country, and they are very difficult to identify by visual inspection. Fortunately, most of them are not severely poisonous."
He advises novices who want to eat wild mushrooms to have their harvest first checked by a professional mycologist rather than relying on a field guide alone.
The weather forecast suggests anyone planning to hunt for mushrooms in the next few days should bring along an umbrella.
Twice the usual amount of rainfall soaked southern Maine in July, with the longest stretch of dry weather just three days, said Augie Sardinha, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Gray. Much of the moisture fell courtesy of Hurricane Bertha, which dumped an average month's worth of rain in a single day, he said.
The damp conditions will likely persist for the next few days at least, probably more. "Once it gets here, it looks like it's going to be reluctant to leave," Sardinha said.
The cool, wet weather is the result of a high-pressure system parked over the Pacific Northwest, he said. That has forced cool, wet weather up into Canada and then down through the Midwest into New England, where it has been held up by high pressure in the Atlantic, he said.
Whatever the explanation, it's been a mushroom's paradise.
"We've had two dry years, and most of the (mushroom) spores that didn't germinate for two years waited," said Sam Ristich of North Yarmouth. "With all of this heavy rain, everything jumped."
Ristich, 80, is considered the resident mushroom guru for the Maine Mycological Association, a club for mushroom fans. He often works with doctors to figure out what type of mushroom a sick person may have eaten.
On Tuesday, Ristich picked a half a bushel of different varieties, including three or four pounds of black trumpets. "This is a phenomenal year for mushrooms," he said. "Anything edible I find, I eat - either fresh, sauteed or dried."
Heydon said the crop is so good this year that she has not had to import the delicacies from Nova Scotia or France.
Chanterelles - yellowish, trumpet-shaped mushrooms with a slight fruit smell - are in adundance this year, she said. One of the best edible mushrooms found in Maine, it is prized for gourmet dishes.
Dan Gillotte, produce manager at the Good Day Market in Portland's East End, said wild mushrooms have grown increasingly popular with consumers trying new dishes.
"I had three people in here today with mushrooms . . . and I know people will buy them," he said.
Wild mushrooms generally require cooperation from nature, unlike their more common domestic relative - the white button mushroom. Those are grown on composted manure in the controlled environment of subterranean, lightless farms.
Wild mushrooms also command high prices from discriminating fungo-philes. The matsutakes, which are coming into season now in Maine, can sell for about $25 a pound for eventual sale in Japan, Heydon said.
Terry Skillin, owner of Skillin's Greenhouses in Falmouth, said wild mushrooms populating many lawns are an asset as much as they are an annoyance for homeowners.
"The mushrooms are breaking down organic matter in the soil," he said.
Mushrooms generally avoid the lawn, because they shun direct sunlight. The shade provided by cloudy, foggy days has allowed mushrooms to take hold. Mushrooms also have enjoyed the cool July temperatures. The worms, maggots and slugs that feed on the mushrooms are less active.
That leaves more wild mushrooms for discriminating humans to feed on, Heydon said.

WET AND COOL
Mushrooms are enjoying the current stretch of wet weather.
The Portland area has logged 6.18 inches of rain in July, compared with 3.08 inches in an average year, according to the National Weather Service.
The month has been cool as well. The average temperature of 67 degrees is below the normal average of 68.6 degrees. Low evening temperatures have been in the low 60s for nine nights and in the 50s for the rest of the month.
HEALTH TIPS
Many mushroom species that grow in Maine can make people sick. Just a handful can be fatal.
Coming down with acute gastro-intestinal problems an hour or two after eating mushrooms can be reassuring, because fatal varieties do not cause those symptoms.
The deadly varieties generally cause sickness within six to 12 hours, bypassing the intestinal area and impacting the liver. Patients sometimes must undergo extensive medical procedures, including liver transplants.
Novices should have their harvests checked by a professional mycologist before eating, experts say.
Anyone who eats a mushroom of an unfamiliar species should call the Maine Poison Center at 1-800-442-6305.

Abstract: Selectman George Watkins identified [Armand] Talbot - a frequent critic of Town Hall and the president of a local group called Citizens for Responsible Government - as one of the major problems facing the board. Tired of his carping, Watkins suggested that perhaps Talbot should no longer be allowed to speak at board meetings. "That's unbelievable," said Talbot, told about Watkins' comments. "But what makes me really mad is that that meeting wasn't televised." Three times, Talbot and his watchdog Citizens for Responsible Government have sued the selectmen, accusing the board of violating the state's right-to-know law. And when a judge dismissed the complaints, Talbot angrily denounced the judge.

Full text: It was a meeting to talk about the important issues facing the Board of Selectmen. Someone mentioned the cleanup of the contaminated Rushton Street landfill. Someone else talked about the bumper-to-bumper traffic that is crippling Main Street.
Then Armand Talbot's name came up.
Selectman George Watkins identified Talbot - a frequent critic of Town Hall and the president of a local group called Citizens for Responsible Government - as one of the major problems facing the board. Tired of his carping, Watkins suggested that perhaps Talbot should no longer be allowed to speak at board meetings.
"That's unbelievable," said Talbot, told about Watkins' comments. "But what makes me really mad is that that meeting wasn't televised."
So it goes.
Talbot, a 59-year-old carpenter and painter, is well known to even casual observers of town affairs in Sanford as a tireless antagonist, an ever-ready sparring partner for a battle-weary board.
Three times, Talbot and his watchdog Citizens for Responsible Government have sued the selectmen, accusing the board of violating the state's right-to-know law. And when a judge dismissed the complaints, Talbot angrily denounced the judge.
"I'm sure Armand would rather be doing something else, but it's almost like he can't," said Daniel Prime, one of the 12 or so members of the citizens group. "He's too concerned about this town and about doing what's best for the people to just be quiet."
Talbot, who describes himself humbly as "a stubborn Frenchman," first became involved in town politics two decades ago when he served on the commission that recommended changes in the town charter.
The experience taught him a lot about local government. But more than anything, Talbot said, he learned that ordinary citizens have an absolute right to express their opinions. And because it's a right many citizens do not exercise, Talbot decided he would.
He speaks at virtually every meeting of the selectmen and videotapes all of them. The Citizens for Responsible Government, formed five years ago, has taped more than 200 board meetings.
"It will be a sad day when a citizen cannot come before the board with an issue of concern," Talbot said. "That's all I'm doing."
Often, Talbot and Freida Pomerleau, his companion of 15 years, are alone in the audience at board meetings. As he stands at the lectern complaining about high taxes, the school budget or the failure of the board to give proper notice of an upcoming meeting, she nods encouragingly.
"He hits all of the right notes," Pomerleau said. "Someone has to tell it like it is. That's what Armand does."
Watkins disagrees. The selectman has called Talbot's complaints frivolous and insulting, and suggested that he stop bothering the board with them. Instead, Watkins recommended Talbot talk to the appropriate department head if he has a problem.
Selectman C. Scott Hoar said he shares Watkins' frustration, but does not believe the board can or should prevent Talbot from talking.
"It's a democracy, for heaven's sake," Hoar said.
Talbot, who is now working with the citizens' group to create another charter commission to overhaul Sanford's government, said he is upset that the selectmen would even contemplate trying to shut him up.
He said some people may consider him a thorn in their side. But he takes a different view.
"My intent is not to irritate anyone. My intent is to inform people," he said. "I think of myself not as a thorn, but as the sand in an oyster. When the membrane forms, it turns into a pearl."

COOKING DISHES `A LA FLORENTINE' MEANS THE SPINACH CROP IS IN EGGS, FISH AND EVEN OYSTERS TEAM UP WELL WITH THE DARK, LEAFY GREEN.

Abstract: I amalso fond of spinach and in a moment of enthusiasm last spring, planted perhaps too much. Spinach plethora is what I have at the moment and as everyone knows, spinach must be picked when it is ready, before it goes to seed. The problem is what to do with it. In a moment of desperation I decided to check out some of those "Florentine" recipes that litter the French cookbooks. Here are some of the results of my research: Meanwhile, having drained the spinach, put it into an ovenproof dish and prepare the eggs. They can be poached or soft boiled. For the latter, put them into a pan of fast-boiling water for exactly five minutes. Then plunge them into a pan of cold water. When they're cool enough to handle, peel the shells gently - the yolks will not be hard boiled. Make six depressions in the spinach with the back of a spoon and set the eggs down in them. Pour the hot sauce over the dish, mix the rest of the cheese with the toast crumbs and sprinkle over the top. Bake in a hot oven for about 10 minutes, until the sauce bubbles and the top turns golden brown. Serves 6. (From Jane Grierson's "Good Things." Atheneum Publishing.)

Full text: Allene White lives in Blue Hill Falls.
It is reported that Catherine de Medici was so fond of spinach that to this day a la florentine almost always identifies in France a dish containing spinach - a meaning that it does not have in Florence.
I amalso fond of spinach and in a moment of enthusiasm last spring, planted perhaps too much. Spinach plethora is what I have at the moment and as everyone knows, spinach must be picked when it is ready, before it goes to seed. The problem is what to do with it. In a moment of desperation I decided to check out some of those "Florentine" recipes that litter the French cookbooks. Here are some of the results of my research:
Eggs Florentine is perhaps the master recipe, and from this concept there are a number of spin-offs.
Eggs Florentine
3 to 4 pounds spinach, cooked
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour
1 cup hot milk
1/2 cup light cream
1 heaping tablespoon Parmesan cheese
6 medium eggs
2 crumbled slices of toast
Salt, pepper, nutmeg
As the spinach cooks, make the sauce. Melt the butter in a heavy pan and stir in the flour with a wooden spoon. Cook gently for two minutes, then gradually, to avoid lumps, incorporate the hot milk and the cream. Season with half the cheese or a little more to taste, with salt, pepper and nutmeg and leave to simmer over low heat for at least 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, having drained the spinach, put it into an ovenproof dish and prepare the eggs. They can be poached or soft boiled. For the latter, put them into a pan of fast-boiling water for exactly five minutes. Then plunge them into a pan of cold water. When they're cool enough to handle, peel the shells gently - the yolks will not be hard boiled. Make six depressions in the spinach with the back of a spoon and set the eggs down in them. Pour the hot sauce over the dish, mix the rest of the cheese with the toast crumbs and sprinkle over the top. Bake in a hot oven for about 10 minutes, until the sauce bubbles and the top turns golden brown. Serves 6. (From Jane Grierson's "Good Things." Atheneum Publishing.)
FOR SOLE FILLETS Florentine, roll up the fillets and secure them with a toothpick. Put them on the spinach instead of the eggs. Finish as above, baking 30 minutes in a moderate oven. The top can be browned under the broiler if necessary.
The same procedure can be used for slices of cooked ham.
Escoffier includes spinach in his recipes involving oysters, tournedos and crayfish souffle, all called "Florentine" - but Pears Florentine is stewed pears on a bed of Bavarian cream. Thank heaven.
IF ANYONE IN your household is still quoting the line about "Real men don't eat Quiche," pay no attention. This recipe is not a quiche - you can call it a savory pie, or to be more accurate, Spinach Pie. This is something you can make and bake any time at all, reheat it in the microwave or eat it at room temperature - just the thing to have in the refrigerator for meals that may be delayed. It's a good party food for the same reason. The three cups of chopped spinach filled my requirements as well.
The real men in my family, my severest critics, gave it a ten - obviously not realizing it was good for them!
Spinach Pie
2 1/2 cups grated Cheddar cheese
1 prebaked pie shell
3 cups fresh spinach, rinsed, dried and chopped
6 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup chopped mushrooms
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon diced red bell pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Sprinkle 1/4 cup of the Cheddar on the bottom of the pie shell. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cheese for the top of the pie.
In a large mixing bowl, stir together allof the remaining ingredients. Pour the filling into the pie shell. Sprinkle the reserved cheese on top. Bake until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature. Serves 6 to 8.

Abstract: State officials reopened much of Maine's midcoast to clamdiggers Monday, ending a weeklong closure that cost clammers hundreds of dollars and had some scrambling to pay their bills. The closure, the result of heavy rains caused by the remnants of Hurricane Bertha, marked another setback for clammers during a season that already has been marred by below-average clam prices and a six-day closure in April. "Everybody's chomping at the bit to get back to work," said Skip Purinton, a clam digger and lobsterman from Harpswell. "This was particularly tough, coming at the height of the season when fishermen hope to get ahead a little."

Full text: State officials reopened much of Maine's midcoast to clamdiggers Monday, ending a weeklong closure that cost clammers hundreds of dollars and had some scrambling to pay their bills.
The closure, the result of heavy rains caused by the remnants of Hurricane Bertha, marked another setback for clammers during a season that already has been marred by below-average clam prices and a six-day closure in April.
"Everybody's chomping at the bit to get back to work," said Skip Purinton, a clam digger and lobsterman from Harpswell. "This was particularly tough, coming at the height of the season when fishermen hope to get ahead a little."
Maine's entire coast was closed to clamming July 14, the day after the remains of the hurricane dumped as much as 6 inches of rain on the area. Officials feared that run-off would carry enough contaminants, such as fertilizers, to pollute clam flats.
Sections west of Cape Elizabeth and east of the Penobscot River were reopened Thursday. But the midcoast, the heaviest producer of the mollusks that are essential to a Maine seafood dinner, remained closed through the weekend.
"Obviously, we want to reopen them as quick as possible within the boundaries of prudent public health," Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden said.
Penn Estabrook, deputy commissioner of marine resources, said clammers should wait until they get official notice before returning to the flats to dig.
He said the state was reopening everything except the Bagaduce, lower Kennebec and Scarborough rivers.
The reopenings will not affect the many coves and other small areas that are permanently closed to clamming because of direct discharge from sewage treatment plants or polluted streams, Estabrook said.
Mike Bernier, a Harpswell clammer, said the closure cost him about $1,500. He said the timing could not have been worse, because it came during a time of "double tides," when two low tides occur during daylight hours. Clammers can dig only at low tide, and in most places they are not permitted to dig at night.
"A lot of people lost a lot of money," said Bernier. "I had just got all caught up with my winter bills, and now I've fallen behind again. It don't feel good."
Bernier said he probably will not make up the loss the rest of the year.
Some clammers speculated that the closure could help them in the long run by increasing the demand for clams and pushing up prices that have been low so far this season.
Before the closure, clammers were receiving about $60 per bushel, about $10 less than last July. Clammers typically dig two or three bushels at each low tide.
Jim MacLeod, a clam digger and chairman of Brunswick's Marine Resources Committee, said the closure should push prices up to $70 or $80 a bushel.
"This might be the best thing that could have happened to us," MacLeod said.
Bernier disagreed. He said clam prices might rise for a day or two, but will probably return to the $60 level within a week.
"Everybody's chomping at the bit to get back to work. This was particularly tough, coming at the height of the season when fishermen hope to get ahead a little." Skip Purinton, Harpswell

Abstract: Silent is the Mighty Kotzschmar, dismantled and in storage while Portland City Hall Auditorium undergoes renovations. That hasn't stopped Friends of the Kotzschmar Organ from offering its usual summer recitals, though on another instrument in a different hall: the 57-stop electropneumatic organ in the chancel of Portland's Cathedral Church of St. Luke, built by E.M. Skinner in 1928. Meanwhile, [Ray] Cornils' own church, First Parish in Brunswick, has a Tuesday organ series too, but at mid-day. This week Sean Fleming, organist of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Newcastle, will play music of Bennett, Buxtehude and Franck on the church's 1883 Hutchings-Plaisted organ, starting at 12:10 p.m. Admission is free, with donations encouraged; call 729-7331 days, 443-6597 evenings. ALL OF THE DOWN EAST summer festivals are now up and running. The opening recital of the Mount Desert Festival of Chamber Music, on Tuesday at 8:15 p.m. in Northeast Harbor's Neighborhood House, will present music of Bartok, Mozart and Schumann, performed by the Composers' String Quartet (Matthew Raimondi and Anahid Ajemian, violins; Ronald Carbone, viola; Mark Shuman, cello) with Evelyne Crochet, piano.

HEAVY STORM SHUTS DOWN CLAM HARVEST PRIME TIME FOR SHELL- FISHING IS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF RUN- OFF AND SEWAGE OVERFLOW.

Abstract: Maine's shellfish industry was temporarily shut down this week when the state closed its entire coastline to harvesting because of bacterial pollution caused by heavy rains linked to Hurricane Bertha. The statewide closure took effect Monday. By Wednesday afternoon, two-thirds of the state's coastline was reopened for shellfish harvesting after tests showed bacteria in the water had dropped to safe levels. State officials said they typically close the coastline to shellfish harvesting when storms dump more than 3 inches of rain along the coast. Remnants of Hurricane Bertha poured 3 to 5 inches of rain on some coastal areas last Saturday, leading to the first statewide shellfishing closure this year.

Full text: Maine's shellfish industry was temporarily shut down this week when the state closed its entire coastline to harvesting because of bacterial pollution caused by heavy rains linked to Hurricane Bertha.
The statewide closure took effect Monday. By Wednesday afternoon, two-thirds of the state's coastline was reopened for shellfish harvesting after tests showed bacteria in the water had dropped to safe levels.
However, Maine's midcoast, the state's most productive area for shellfish, remains closed.
The impact of the shutdown, which comes at peak season, has been felt by marine businesses and consumers alike.
Shellfishing operations essentially are forced to shut down until the bans are lifted. Some Portland-area restaurants reported they could not serve fresh steamed clams, but that diners were ordering other things.
Yarmouth's popular Clam Festival, to be held this weekend, is not affected. Its operators said they stockpile local shellfish well in advance.
State officials said they typically close the coastline to shellfish harvesting when storms dump more than 3 inches of rain along the coast. Remnants of Hurricane Bertha poured 3 to 5 inches of rain on some coastal areas last Saturday, leading to the first statewide shellfishing closure this year.
The downpour flooded sewage treatment plants, causing them to dump their overflow. It also washed agricultural pollutants - from cattle, horses and other sources - into rivers and streams.
Fecal coliform bacteria counts shot up along Maine's shores as a result. On Monday morning, the state stopped harvesting of shellfish, including clams, quahogs, oysters and mussels.
Areas normally open for shellfish harvesting were reopened Wednesday afternoon- except the midcoast, which stretches from the east side of Penobscot Bay to Cape Elizabeth. That stretch represents about a third of the state's coastline.
State officials said the midcoast may remain closed to shellfishing until next week. It will reopen when tests show bacteria in the water has dropped to safe levels.
The closure comes at a bad time for the industry. Two-thirds of shellfish harvests occur between June and October. Maine's shellfish industry generated more than $11 million in landing sales in 1994, the latest figure available.
State officials could not recall the last time there was a statewide shellfishing closure in July. The National Weather Service says that's because it has been 57 years since a storm dumped more than 3 inches of rain on a single July day.
"This is the worst time it could happen," said Derek Zimmerman, 33, a clam digger from Brunswick. "This is prime money time for us. I'm losing $150 to $200 a day."
Some businesses will lose several days of sales. Others could lose a week.
Chip Davison, president of Great Eastern Mussel Farms Inc. at Tenents Harbor, said his company could lose about $50,000.
"It's a terrible time for this to happen," he said. "I expect to be open by the weekend, but nobody knows."
The closure has temporarily cut off the supply of steamed clams for some Maine restaurants, said Ben Alfiero, owner of Harbor Fish Market in Portland. "There's nothing available," he said.
Restaurants can order from out of state,but for many restaurants the cost is prohibitive, he said.
Jim Gilbert, general manager of Gilbert's Restaurant on Commercial Street, said he also has stopped serving steamers. Some people are disappointed, but Gilbert said he's not losing customers.
"We offer a wide variety of other things" to eat, he said.
The shellfish industry supports the closure, even though it hurts business.
"To have the entire state closed is particularly harsh, but it's the right thing to do," said Bob Hessler, assistant general manager of Maine Shellfish Co., one of the largest shellfish suppliers in the state. "We support this 100 percent. We think public safety is the most important thing."
Shellfish harvests are stopped when tests by the state Department of Marine Resources show that coliform bacteria levels exceed health standards. When tests find more than 14 groups of bacteria per 100 milliliters of water, a ban goes into effect.
The ban is removed when bacteria counts consistently fall below that level, said Penn Estabrook, deputy commissioner of Marine Resources.
Coliform bacteria comes from the intestines of animals. It is important because scientists view it as an indicator organism that can signal more dangerous bacteria in the water.
Such bacteria pose a health threat because shellfish basically eat the organisms. If someone eats contaminated shellfish, they ingest the bacteria. That could cause illnesses as mild as an upset stomach or as serious as typhoid, Estabrook said.
The shellfish eventually clean themselves of harmful bacteria because they constantly move clean water through their digestive systems, Estabrook said.
The Yarmouth Clam Festival expects to go through 350 gallons of clams this weekend. It has lots of local clams stockpiled, said Bob Goddard, co-director of the festival.
"It's called planning ahead." SHELLFISH WARNING
The following species were affected by the Maine Department of Marine Resources' decision to close large stretches of the Maine shore to shellfishing:
Clams, quahogs, oysters, mussels, carnivorous whelks and carnivorous snails.
(Note: Some areas in Maine were opened on Wednesday to harvest. Large areas remained closed. For more information, call the state hotline at: 1-800-232-4733.)

Abstract: Clam diggers are scouring mud flats all along the Maine coast for as many tasty bivalves as they can find to feed the more than 150,000 clam-hungry people expected to attend the Yarmouth Clam Festival this weekend. The 31st annual festival features three days jam-packed with parades, carnival rides, sporting events, fireworks, live music and arts and crafts displays. But the main attraction is food, and the most popular menu item is the clam. Festival organizers plan to round up about 100,000 unshucked clams and 200 gallons of pre-shucked clams to satiate the crowd's cravings for chowders, clam rolls, steamers, batter-fried clams and clams fried in crumbs.

Full text: Clam diggers are scouring mud flats all along the Maine coast for as many tasty bivalves as they can find to feed the more than 150,000 clam-hungry people expected to attend the Yarmouth Clam Festival this weekend.
The 31st annual festival features three days jam-packed with parades, carnival rides, sporting events, fireworks, live music and arts and crafts displays. But the main attraction is food, and the most popular menu item is the clam.
Festival organizers plan to round up about 100,000 unshucked clams and 200 gallons of pre-shucked clams to satiate the crowd's cravings for chowders, clam rolls, steamers, batter-fried clams and clams fried in crumbs.
While almost all of the mollusks will be yanked from Maine mud, none will be Yarmouth natives. The town does not have any clam flats open to commercial clammers.
So Bill Bradford, the festival's co-director, is bringing in most of the clams from clam companies in
Eastport and Jonesport. He said that during some past years, red tide has limited the clam supply. But this year he is confident that more than enough clams will be delivered on time.
"Everything is going just as smoothly as it ever has," Bradford said.
The festival originated in 1966 as a local clam bake. It has grown into one of the largest and most popular dates on Maine's summer festival calendar. Last year, the festival set an attendance record, with more than 50,000 people attending each day. This year, festival organizers expect to attract even more people and to offer more attractions than ever before.
One of the biggest attractions is the arts and crafts display. More than 500 artisans applied this year to display their wares, the most applications the festival has ever received, said Linda Gray, a member of the organizing committee.
She said all the applications will translate into 132 crafts booths, compared to 92 last year.
"It just keeps growing," Gray said. "The interest in this event is amazing."
Some of the other events include golf tips offered by golf professionals Friday afternoon, a performance by the popular Maine's blues band the Boneheads Friday night, the Maine State Clam Shucking Contest Saturday morning, the Great Royal River Canoe Race Saturday afternoon, and a bike race on Sunday.
Throughout the festival a carnival will operate on fields near the Rowe School, and volunteers will serve delicacies from 28 food booths.
Along with the clams, the booths will serve blueberry pancakes, strawberry shortcake, ice cream, deli sandwiches, pizza and watermelon. They also expect to dish out about 1,200 locally caught lobsters and more than 1 1/2 tons of french fried potatoes.
All the booths will be operated by local non-profit agencies, such as churches, boys and girls clubs and various school booster groups.
The festival kicks off Friday at 10 a.m. with opening ceremonies on the memorial green. It wraps up with jazz performances at 4 p.m. on Sunday on the memorial green and the North Yarmouth Academy lawn.

Full text: Lobster shells and scraps of meat that usually end up in the garbage heap will be turned into useful products that could include lobster burgers, if a Down East company's recycling project is a success.
Carver Shellfish Inc. of Beals Island is already selling a line of quick-frozen lobster tails and claws.
Now, it's developing a process to turn every scrap of the crustacean into something useful. Essential to the project is a machine adapted from the poultry industry that separates lobster waste into two components: meat paste and ground powder of shell and fiber.
"We've been working for four years to add as much value as possible to lobster, to move away from merely selling an unimproved natural resource," said Raoul Pelletier, who heads the waste recovery project that is funded in part by a $37,500 federal grant.
The recovered paste can be used as a base for soups, sauces, salad dressings, stuffings, and perhaps even lobster burgers. Pelletier is working with the University of Maine's Food Science Department to develop products and conduct taste tests.
The shells and fiber have been found to be useful as a nutrient-rich additive to fertilizer and feed for the salmon aquaculture industry.
While Pelletier acknowledged that some of the ideas have been put into practice in Canada, he is committed to making the lobster industry waste-free someday.
Maine's lobster industry has enjoyed record harvests in recent years, with hauls in the range of 40 million pounds. But Pelletier believes the harvests will decline after stocks of fish like cod and haddock - which feed on young lobsters - rebound.
In the meantime, lobster processors must fight a public perception that the only good lobster is a live lobster, said Brent Beal of Carver's Island Maid brand of frozen shellfish. Carver's produced about 800,000 pounds of frozen lobster product last year and wants to sell 1 million pounds this year.
Pelletier said the lobster industry has faced a huge disadvantage by having to sell a live product.
"Imagine what would happen to the poultry industry if people suddenly thought they had to bring live chickens home from the store," Pelletier said.

Abstract: On another part of the island, meanwhile, Claire Filliettaz was enjoying summer for the first time in two years. In May, the city of Portland sprayed her neighborhood and parts of other Casco Bay islands, with the pesticide Dimilin. "We wanted to have a good summer andit turns out we can," she said. Spraying has clearly worked on the islands, where browntail moth caterpillars have caused rashes and breathing problems for the last two summers. Targeted neighborhoods are virtually free of the caterpillars and their hairs, and officials say the pesticide doesn't appear to have harmed lobsters in the bay. Like [Gerald] Teplitsky, many on Peaks Island want the city to stop asking their neighbors' permission and just spray the whole island with Dimilin. Neighborhoods where property owners objected could not be sprayed this year.

Full text: Within hours after Gerald Teplitsky got off the ferry on Peaks Island Tuesday, he started scratching.
His arms and chest broke out in a rash that looked like measles and itched like severe poison ivy. Microscopic hairs from browntail moth caterpillars were drifting through the air and through his shirt.
"I'm leaving tomorrow," he said Wednesday after spending most of his abbreviated vacation in his summer house.
On another part of the island, meanwhile, Claire Filliettaz was enjoying summer for the first time in two years. In May, the city of Portland sprayed her neighborhood and parts of other Casco Bay islands, with the pesticide Dimilin. "We wanted to have a good summer andit turns out we can," she said.
Spraying has clearly worked on the islands, where browntail moth caterpillars have caused rashes and breathing problems for the last two summers. Targeted neighborhoods are virtually free of the caterpillars and their hairs, and officials say the pesticide doesn't appear to have harmed lobsters in the bay.
As the season for allergic reactions peaks, the relief that some islanders feel is creating pressure for more spraying. But opposition remains, from those who fear that Dimilin will cause unknown health problems or harm lobsters and the environment.
There is still no simple solution. Several alternatives to Dimilin - a bacterial pesticide, beetles and fungus - have so far failed in laboratory tests to provide the "silver bullet" that would restore the comfort and clean air to island life, and prevent the pest from spreading inland.
Like Teplitsky, many on Peaks Island want the city to stop asking their neighbors' permission and just spray the whole island with Dimilin. Neighborhoods where property owners objected could not be sprayed this year.
"I think they have a disaster out here that they're playing with and they don't understand the magnitude of," Teplitsky said.
"It's difficult for me to understand how a few people could thwart the will of the vast majority," said Richard Swarts, a year-round islander.
"Maine has very stringent chemical trespass laws," explained Richard Dearborn, a Maine Forest Service entomologist who is searching for a solution.
Portland officials are now gathering information about health problems, which could lead the state to permit expanded spraying next spring.
Accidental immigrants
Browntail moths were accidentally brought to this country in the 1880s in a shipment of roses from Europe. In the early 1900s, browntails spread from Rhode Island to the Maritimes and west to Vermont, covering much of Maine, Dearborn said. They have since remained localized around Cape Cod, coastal Massachusetts and Casco Bay.
The latest epidemic started in 1989 on Casco Bay's islands. It has already spread to the mainland. Bradbury found moth webs last winter from Kittery to Port Clyde. He said two people were treated last summer for anaphylactic shock from browntail reactions: One was from Chebeague Island and the other was from Cumberland.
Brown with a tawny fringe of prickly hairs, the larvae feed energetically on leaves and have the potential to strip acres of vegetation.
The caterpillars emerged from websearly in May and are about to head into cocoons and become moths. But their hairs will still drift in the air.
In May, the city hired a crop duster to spray parts of Peaks, Great Diamond and Cushing islands. The same contractor sprayed two privately owned islands, Clapboard and Sturdivant, and parts of Falmouth on the mainland.
On Peaks and other islands, it's easy to see where the pesticide was sprayed by whether the oak trees have healthy leaves.
Dimilin is considered harmless to humans and other mammals, birds and fish. But it can't be sprayed within 100 feet of the bay because it can harm lobsters and other shellfish.
Mixed reaction on Peaks
Spraying became a community controversy on Peaks Island.
Getting permission elsewhere was easy - all 41 property owners on Cushing Island approved. But on Peaks - with 1,234 properties - there was a more mixed reaction. Some residents protested loudly, saying Dimilin may threaten their health and the environment. Their opposition meant the city could not spray their neighborhoods.
This summer's infestation may have changed some minds.
"A lot of people have come around 180 degrees," said Dearborn, who has developed a strong allergy to the caterpillar hairs since he started studying them.
There could well be unknown risks from the use of pesticides, Dearborn said. "But the other side of the coin is we don't know what the long-term effects of being poisoned continuously by the caterpillar hairs are." He said a researcher years agodied from an allergic reaction.
Usual visitors stay away
The last time he visited Peaks Island, Gerald Teplitsky felt ill for a week and didn't get rid of the itchy red blotches for 3 1/2 weeks. He didn't come back for months.
Teplitsky and others on the island said neighbors have stayed away this summer, as have their own families who used to visit.
Robert Hannigan, owner of Feeney's Market, said the busloads of schoolchildren who visit the island and buy ice cream at his store never came this year.
Feeney's sales are down between 10 and 12 percent this summer, he said. "I'd attribute that to the browntail," said Hannigan, who also blames the caterpillars for some of his own sinus congestion.
But some property owners still fear the chemical more than the caterpillar. "I refused spraying and I will not have my property sprayed if I have anything to say about it," said Ellen Tripp.
Tripp broke out in the rash after cuddling her cat, which had been outside. And she knows that it's more than a nuisance. "Some people have been made quite ill," she said.
But, she said, "We just have too many questions about Dimilin and the other chemicals to allow them to be used on our land. . . . We hope there will be positive results from the beetle experiments and that they'll find some natural products."
Alternatives prove elusive
Researchers in Connecticut and at Cornell University in New York are studying alternatives. But nothing new has surfaced that could provide relief this summer - or next.
Beetles have been introduced on islands and could help keep the caterpillar population in check. A fungus that looks like bread mold, and was found on dead caterpillars, also might eventually help limit the pest. Neither will stop the infestation in the near term.
The most promising research, on a bacterial agent called Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, has yielded mixed results in the laboratory. Field tests probably won't start this summer as hoped, said Dearborn. Tests will likely continue into next spring.
Dimilin may again be the only weapon available next summer.
Portland's Division of Public Health is mailing surveys to residents of Cushing, Little Diamond, Great Diamond, Peaks and Cliff islands to determine what kinds of moth-related health problems they are having. The surveys are also available on ferries and the islands.
"The surveys are pouring in," said Cathy Brigham, the city's coordinator of the survey. Her office got about 600 back in the first four days. "People are really upset about it."
Survey results will be given to the state epidemiologist. If the caterpillars are considered a serious health threat, the state could waive the requirement that all property owners consent to spraying. Or the city might pursue a change in state law to relax the requirement.
Lobster fishing concerns
The lobster industry and the state Department of Marine Resources can still object, however.
Jay Krouse, the department's chief lobster biologist, said lobsters taken from the shoreline after the limited spraying have shed normally and appear to be unaffected.
But he said the limited spraying is a compromise and he would still object to a major expansion of the program.
Krouse, too, hopes a better answer comes along first.
Ellen Tripp and other opponents of Dimilin spraying appear willing to wait.
She said one neighbor whose son had respiratory problems called to ask Tripp to change her mind about the spraying. "I said, `I'm sorry, but no.' " "It's difficult for me to understand how a few people could thwart the will of the vast majority." Richard Swarts, islander
"We just have too many questions about Dimilin and the other chemicals to allow them to be used on our land." Ellen Tripp, islander

Infested areas that weren't sprayed - including most of Peaks Island - are paying a toll in defoliation and human discomfort. Browntails have been seen as far south as Kittery and asfar north as Port Clyde, but the infestation is worst in and around Casco Bay.

And with a fullmoon shining over the sea, this makes for a fine evening of dining and companionship. On our night a particular bottle we desired was not in stock. The restaurant was able to provide another vintage of that particular wine, though a less desirable one. We dined early in the season and were told the cellar was still being stocked. A suitable price was agreed upon for the replacement bottle; thus we experienced the professional manner in which the restaurant's management deals with problems.

Full text:   D.B. Eberhart is a writer, former professional chef and Greater Portland resident. Eberhart dines anonymously. Restaurants are visited once, with a second visit when necessary. The Telegram pays for the meals.
The Ships Restaurant in the Bradley Inn offers well-prepared dishes, live piano music, and a short walk after dinner to Pemaquid Lighthouse. And with a fullmoon shining over the sea, this makes for a fine evening of dining and companionship.
The inn's new management retained the old kitchen staff. The inn is comfortable, sufficiently rustic to suit the spot and at the same time sufficiently formal to make a jacket and tie worthwhile.
In short, this is a destination spot, and it ought to visited when there is a private celebration of some sort. It is worth the trip.
After a nice drive through the Maine countryside, we arrived for our weekendmeal with the feeling that we had found a nice haven.
Visitors entering the foyer of the inn are struck immediately by the relaxing atmosphere, where the staff greets you and the decor - the ship models, etc. - intrigues you.
Our table was comfortable and nicely set with white linen, bright stemware, and shining utensils.
Ships Restaurant's menu, established by Chef Jeff Parker, is short, simple in some items, and demanding in others.
Those who look for steamers, a steak, and a slice of chocolate cake (albeit called a torte) will be satisfied. On the other hand, a more complex meal may be selected as well.
The restaurant's wine list is satisfactory, with reasonable depth and breadth. Prices are slightly high, although some of the more unusual vintages are worth it.
On our night a particular bottle we desired was not in stock. The restaurant was able to provide another vintage of that particular wine, though a less desirable one. We dined early in the season and were told the cellar was still being stocked. A suitable price was agreed upon for the replacement bottle; thus we experienced the professional manner in which the restaurant's management deals with problems.
Six appetizers ($4-$10) include a soup, a salad, and the steamers, but there's also Duck Hash and Sausage Potato Tart ($6), Shrimp and Oyster Gazpacho Cocktail ($10), and House Gravlax and Fresh Mozzarella Salad ($8).
We selected the tart and the gravlax. The tart, served on a bed of attractive greens, was characterized by rich, deep flavors, very well melded. It was a smallish portion, but a satisfying one.
Equally enticing, though with a different character, was the lusciously mild gravlax, very nicely prepared, interleaved with the freshest and most delightful mozzarella, accented with greens.
Seven entrees ($14-$23) include four seafoods - lobster, mussels, salmon, and haddock - and three meats - beef, lamb, chicken. Preparations are generally new American haute bistro, and accompanying dishes are creatively treated.
Our choices were Poached Salmon and Pemaquid Mussels in a Saffron Cream Sauce ($16) and Grilled Loin of Lamb Chops with Minted Carmelized Onions ($18).
The treat of the two was the lamb, which was prepared exactly to order and was accompanied by a wonderful slice of pepper-studded polenta and the onions. The onions were supremely flavored, in their combination of the mint - traditional with lamb - and the rich deepness of the slow-cooked onion itself.
While the seafood dish was delicious, it was more nearly a bouillabaisse in style and presentation than we had expected. As a result, the sauce, which was liquid, did not present the saffron flavor in the forthright way we had anticipated; instead it swam loosely through the dish.
Four dessert choices ($5-$7) include the chocolate torte (with cinnamon Kahlua creme anglaise - $6.50), Mocha Creme Caramel, pretty and interesting white chocolate ice cream swans set on a wash of strawberry-rhubarb coulis, and Blueberry Sorbet with Fresh Fruit ($6).
We selected the first and the last. Each was very good, with the sorbet being satisfactorily smooth, and the torte as darkly, richly, deeply chocolate as may be.
In all, we ate delightful food. We have only two complaints.
First, the meal was paced too fast. The kitchen was not busy, but the dishes came too fast for relaxed dining. At a destination spot, the diner wants to linger over the meal, and this was not possible for us.
The second point is that the portions were small, making the dollar value of the entrees low - albeit adequately compensated by the nice atmosphere. The smallness of the servings contributes to the rushed meal. It takes longer to eat more food than less food, obviously.
Though it will affect their profit margin, the restaurant might consider increasing the portion size. It also ought to slow down the turn-around.

DIVERS TO MEASURE EXTENT OF OIL SPILL DAMAGE ABOUT 20 BARRELS OF OIL SANK TO THE OCEAN FLOOR NEAR THE PISCATAGUA RIVER DURING A TANKER ACCIDENT MONDAY.

Abstract: Divers and oil-collecting equipment will be in the water near the Piscataqua River between Maine and New Hampshire this weekend to measure the extent of damage caused by Monday's oil spill. The divers will look for large pockets of oil on the ocean floor, while pom-pom shaped oil-collection devices will hang from boats to sample how many oil droplets are rolling and swirling along the bottom. The results of this study will tell scientists within two or three days whether an underwater cleanup effort will be required. Officials are still investigating exactly why the Provence broke free from its 15 to 20 mooring cables. The Maine and New Hampshire Port Safety Forum - comprised of oil industry representatives, marine safety officers, environmental officials and others - is expected to review mooring requirements in the coming weeks, said Lt. Jeff Gafkjen of the U.S. Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office.

Full text: Divers and oil-collecting equipment will be in the water near the Piscataqua River between Maine and New Hampshire this weekend to measure the extent of damage caused by Monday's oil spill.
The divers will look for large pockets of oil on the ocean floor, while pom-pom shaped oil-collection devices will hang from boats to sample how many oil droplets are rolling and swirling along the bottom. The results of this study will tell scientists within two or three days whether an underwater cleanup effort will be required.
The unusual damage-assessment program will be undertaken because nearly all of the 15 to 20 barrels of heavy oil spilled by the tanker Provence immediately sank to the sea bottom, environmental officials said.
The spill happened when the tanker broke free from its moorings and spewed out some of the fuel it was delivering to a New Hampshire power plant through two 10-inch-wide hoses.
Officials are still investigating exactly why the Provence broke free from its 15 to 20 mooring cables. The Maine and New Hampshire Port Safety Forum - comprised of oil industry representatives, marine safety officers, environmental officials and others - is expected to review mooring requirements in the coming weeks, said Lt. Jeff Gafkjen of the U.S. Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office.
On Friday, the blue-green water churned in the wind, lifting a half dozen lobster boats moored against the current. The pristine-looking waters gave no hint of the oil that remains beneath the surface.
The spill does not pose a health risk to humans, authorities said, because any affected fish or shellfish would be covered in oil and immediately identifiable. Trace amountsof oil will be ingested by some marine life and harmlessly excreted over time.
Droplets of oil will mix with sand and sediment, officials said. Only larger pools of oil identified by this weekend's damage assessment would be sucked from the water by pumps or hoses. The tankers' owners will pay for any such cleanup.
Environmental officials remained confident that the tanker spilled no more than 800 gallons of the No. 6 fuel oil, despite concerns among lobstermen and others about oil-coated traps andshellfish.
Stephen Lehman, scientific support coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, compared the oil on lobster traps to leaves in a heavy wind. Just as wind blows leaves into bushes, he said, the water's currents push oil droplets against lobsters and traps.
"This is an unusual oil," said David Sait, director of response services for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. "We don't have a lot of experience with it, nor does anyone else."
Sait and other environmental officials said they could not remember other oil spills in Maine or New Hampshire waters in which the oil sank. Sinking oil could present major problems for the area's fisheries, because bottom-dwelling lobsters and clams represent a valuable fishery.
Lehman said Monday's relatively small spill could offer a valuable learning experience for handling a major spill in the future.
If the Provence had ruptured and spilled far more of its 250,000 barrels of oil, the area would have faced an ecological disaster. As it happened, the Provence drifted to the Maine side of the river and settled in the mud, spilling only the oil it had already pumped into the two fuel lines.
"It's not that a cup of oil is so damaging," Lehman said. "It's the quantity. If we shipped milk by supertanker, we'd be worried about it."
Even though most of the spilled oil sank, about 25 workers spent Friday cleaning an area around Fox Point. Nearby marshy areas will not be cleaned, Lehman said, because theplants would be harmed more by the remediation effort than by the oil.
"Activity in those marshes will kill the marshes," he said. "Oil on the leaves within a number of days becomes just black paint" that does no further environmental damage.

Full text: Scott Andrews is a sports enthusiast who lives in Portland.
One of the loveliest spots in Maine also is one of its quietest and least visited. And that's not because it's hard to find.
Located only a few miles off busy Route 1, the Maine Audubon Society's Josephine Newman Sanctuary offers 119 acres of forests, fields and estuaries, with 2 1/2 miles of walking trails along attractive Robinhood Cove.
And on most days, even busy holidays, you'll have it all to yourself.
Enhance your visit by first purchasing the sanctuary's 60-page illustrated guide: "Fields, Forests and Estuaries" by Janet McMahon, available for $3.50 at Maine Audubon's Gilsland Farm headquarters in Falmouth.
The sanctuary is open year round. Picnickers are welcome, but pets, bikes, fires and camping are prohibited. There are no buildings or facilities.
To get there, drive south from Woolwich on Route 127. Find the entrance 9.1 miles south of Route 1, shortly after passing a general store and crossing a small bridge. The entrance road (dirt) is signed on the right.
The tiny parking area is near a cattail marsh. Three loop trails, totaling 2 1/2 miles, radiate from the marsh.
The Self-Guiding Trail, about 1/2 mile, has 20 numbered stops, each keyed to the guidebook. This easy trail includes pleasant overlooks of Robinhood Cove.
If you time your visit for mid-tide, enjoy the Reversing Falls at a narrow constriction. Here the water tumbles over ledge - into the cove on an incoming tide and out of the cove on a falling tide.
The overlapping Rocky End Trail and the Horseshoe Trail, totalling about 2 miles, offer more varied terrain, including a few steep sections, and more expansive views of the cove.
Fourteen distinct inland vegetation zones are located in the sanctuary. Plus there are six shoreline zones and sub-zones. These are mapped and thoroughly described in the guidebook. A few of the marine zones:
The salt marsh is one of the most interesting. The plants must endure extremes of stresses, including immersion by the tide, wide variations of temperature and water salinity. Cordgrass is found closest to the water, salt hay dominates the middle portions and sea lavender characterizes the upper sections.
The importance of salt marshes has been well documented by biologists. An estimated 70 percent of all commercial species of fish and shellfish spend a portion of their lives in this zone.
Life in the mudflats is concentrated on the surface and the top few inches of the mud. Periwinkles and several species of grazing snailare found on the top.
Three species of clams live in the mud: quahog, soft-shell and macoma. The first two are edible varieties. Several marine worms share this same territory, including the voracious nereis and the ribbon worm, which grows as long as three feet.
The four sub-zones of the rocky shore are best seen in the narrow cut about a third of the way around the Self-Guiding Trail. Uppermost is the splash zone, mostly dominated by a slippery, gelatinous blue-green algae, and xanthoria, a beautiful yellow-orange lichen.
The periwinkle zone is where tidal innundation occurs only twice monthly. Hundreds of periwinkles visit to graze on the blue-green algae.
Next down is the barnacle zone, where the tide covers twice daily. Barnacles are filter feeders; often they colonize so densely that all other species are crowded out.
The rockweed zone is fully or partially submerged daily. Blue mussels, several crab species and other crustaceans abound here.

REASON FOR REQUEST DOESN'T MATTER; TOWN WILL LET GRASS GROW

Abstract: Town officials are scratching their heads after receiving a letter last week from Edward P. Mattar III "demanding" that they immediately cease all mowing and maintaining of three properties at the former Nasson College. Mattar's demand is odd because the Worcester, Mass., businessman no longer owns the properties: Allen and Marland Halls and the Science Building. The U.S. Department of Education last winter foreclosed on the buildings after Mattar failed to pay more than $570,000 in back taxes, fees and loans. "Happy retirement," he said to Raynald "Pete" Beaudoin, the man who has run the diner for 31 years. Pete retired Friday and is now leasing the popular breakfast joint to Tony Ouellette.

But pending an auction of the properties next fall, the town will let the grass grow tall around the three buildings.
Even a defeated politician can still wake up hungry
BIDDEFORD - Where do defeated politicians go for breakfast?
Answer: The same place the successful ones go - Palace Diner.
Evidence of this surfaced last week when Sean Faircloth, the state senator from Bangor, showed up at the Palace with his wife and two kids for breakfast.
"We're vacationing," Faircloth said. He lost in the June 11 Democratic primary to Joe Brennan for the party's nomination to the U.S. Senate.
As the family left the diner after finishing breakfast, Faircloth didn't forget his manners - as no politician does.
"Happy retirement," he said to Raynald "Pete" Beaudoin, the man who has run the diner for 31 years. Pete retired Friday and is now leasing the popular breakfast joint to Tony Ouellette.
Kany begins loading up his retirment schedule
SACO - A. William Kany Jr., retiring as president and chief executive officer of Saco-Biddeford Savings Institution, is already embarking on retirement projects.
Kany has been elected vice chairman of the board of trustees of the Maine Technical College System.
Kany was instrumental in establishing the new York County Technical College in Wells.
Teen model from York a finalist in competition
YORK - Hats off to Kristina Rostad.
The 14-year-old model was named one of 12 finalists last week in Elite Modeling Agency's GUESS Model Look competition in New York City.
Now, it's on to international competition in Nice, France. She'll compete against 60 other models in early September.
Her mother, Laurie Rostad, said she's very proud of her daughter. But she wants to make sure modeling remains a sideline.
"Kritsina has a lot more going for her than just her looks," her mom said. "She's a very good scholar and goes to a private school. She has the ability to do anything she wants."
Just get in the line, Bill, we'll show you the way
BUXTON - Students in the Electric Car Club at Bonny Eagle High School learned a number of lessons from their first race at Owl's Head last month.
They learned to connect the cables to the battery more carefully and that they needed a sturdier frame, for example.
But that's not all. One of their problems was they barely arrived on time because most of the team drove one way, but the guy with the car - William "Bill" Leeman - drove another, not-so-direct route. (He's taken a fair bit of ribbing for that.)
The lesson?
"To have Bill follow us," said Dave Lund, a fellow team member.
Seeing name on a menu must really ruin their day
OLD ORCHARD BEACH- If emotional shellfish are your style, Village Park next to The Pier in Old Orchard Beach has something for you: a place called Crabby Lobster.
If you don't like the emotional but care for the flamboyant, try something at Krazy Klam.

LOBSTERMEN, RESIDENTS FEAR SPILL'S EFFECTS OFFICIALS SAY THE OIL IS A MINIMAL THREAT, BUT OTHERS SAY IT HAS COVERED MARINE LIFE AND VESSELS ON NEW HAMPSHIRE'S COAST.

Abstract: Local lobstermen and environmental groups question official claims that Monday's oil spill near the Piscataqua River will have minimal environmental impact. Coast Guard officials said Tuesday that the oil was a minimal threat to the environment and marine life, but lobstermen and residents say the oil has covered marine life and vessels. "It accumulates on the seaweed, and results in globs of oil-filled seaweed. I think a great number of lobster and other species will be contaminated," [Martha] Rosholt said.

Full text:   Local lobstermen and environmental groups question official claims that Monday's oil spill near the Piscataqua River will have minimal environmental impact.
"I am very concerned for the wildlife in this area. The baby (geese) chicks aren't even yellow anymore. I don't see how they are going to survive," said Martha Rosholt, a resident.
At least 1,000 gallons of oil leaked into the water when a tanker drifted away from the dock, severing its fuel lines.
Coast Guard officials said Tuesday that the oil was a minimal threat to the environment and marine life, but lobstermen and residents say the oil has covered marine life and vessels.
"It accumulates on the seaweed, and results in globs of oil-filled seaweed. I think a great number of lobster and other species will be contaminated," Rosholt said.
Rosholt's dock and boats are "saturated" with oil, and will have to be removed from the water to be cleaned, she said.
Bob Oxx, the dockmaster at the Portsmouth Yacht Club, said many boat hulls docked at the club are covered with oil.
"I would say that more than half of the boats have a black ring around them," he said.
Clean-up efforts had begun, but they have been called off until an insurance company can estimate the damage.
Frank Heilig, a Durham recreational lobsterman, pulled two oil-covered traps from Little Bay on Tuesday.
"It was early in the morning, around 7, I pulled up one trap, and I couldn't believe what I saw. I didn't know there had been an oil spill and I didn't see a sheen on the water, but the trap was covered. I think the oil must have settled on the bottom," he said.
The lobster in the two traps were also covered with oil, he said.
"I am very upset. They say the oil has been contained, but you can see the effects everywhere," he said.
Coast Guard Capt. Burt Russell said his information shows the oil had spread about six miles, to the mouth of the Piscataqua River.
Local people have a different opinion.
"You can see an oil slick," said state Rep. Debbie Merritt, D-Durham. "It's like little dots of oil."
"The bottom of the boats look like they're coated with tar," she said.
Bruce Smith, a biologist for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, said lobsters with a small amount ofoil on them will be able to clean themselves, but those with heavy oil damage would likely be harmed or killed.
The river also sustains other sensitive marine life, including shellfish, oysters, mussels, fish and species of plants and animals, he said.

BREAK AWAY FROM TRADITION TO MAKE YOUR OWN `LOCAL-INGREDIENTS' PAELLA THE CONCAVE PAN IN WHICH PAELLA IS MADE COMES IN CERTAIN SIZES TO MATCH THE NUMBER OF GUESTS YOU WILL BE SERVING.

Abstract: To confuse things a bit, the word paella means both "pan" as well as the ricey concoction IN the pan. It may have begun when the Romans brought with them the large flat dish and the Moors followed, in due course, with the rice. Valencians - they alone are responsible for paella Valenciana - put the Islamic rice in the flat, double-handled Roman dish with foods that were generally available: vegetables, chicken and rabbit. In order to produce the perfect taste, the dish had to be just large enough so that all liquid is absorbed at exactly the moment when the rice is almost soft but still chewy. The traditional ingredients may surprise you: rice, rabbit, chicken, green beans, lima beans - a large variety called garrofon - rosemary or snails that have fed on rosemary, tomatoes, saffron and paprika. However, the important issue is not the wood but the ingredients. Paella Valenciana must not contain shellfish, chorizo sausage, pork chops or peas. This is not to say that it doesn't happen - it's just that the available ingredients were originally rice, rabbit and chicken. And snails fed on rosemary. Everything was done in a very small space without wasting valuable wood, and necessity produced a very special flavor.

Full text:   If you read the travel pages, Spain is the land ofgazpacho, sangria and Amontillado sherry; when they get around to mentioning anything more solid, it's usually paella.
To confuse things a bit, the word paella means both "pan" as well as the ricey concoction IN the pan. It may have begun when the Romans brought with them the large flat dish and the Moors followed, in due course, with the rice. Valencians - they alone are responsible for paella Valenciana - put the Islamic rice in the flat, double-handled Roman dish with foods that were generally available: vegetables, chicken and rabbit. In order to produce the perfect taste, the dish had to be just large enough so that all liquid is absorbed at exactly the moment when the rice is almost soft but still chewy.
The pans are made in a variety of sizes. There are standards that make the number of guests commensurate with the diameter of the pan you use - it runs from 30 centimeters for two or three people to 90 centimeters for 40 hungry eaters. All pans are shallow and round for even cooking. Using a small round table, it was possible in the old days to eat out of the pan with boxwood spoons, another Moorish tradition.
The traditional ingredients may surprise you: rice, rabbit, chicken, green beans, lima beans - a large variety called garrofon - rosemary or snails that have fed on rosemary, tomatoes, saffron and paprika.
The other part of this classic dish is the most difficult to reproduce. A traditional paella must be done over a wood fire and the tending of the fire requires constant attention. The preferred fuel is twigs and vine cuttings, especially apricot twigs - (try to pronounce the Spanish word for apricot tree: albaricoquero.)
However, the important issue is not the wood but the ingredients. Paella Valenciana must not contain shellfish, chorizo sausage, pork chops or peas. This is not to say that it doesn't happen - it's just that the available ingredients were originally rice, rabbit and chicken. And snails fed on rosemary. Everything was done in a very small space without wasting valuable wood, and necessity produced a very special flavor.
The same techniques may be followed with ingredients that YOU may have available. Just don't call it paella Valenciana; change it to Paella Casco Bay, or Farmer's Market. It is done most easily outdoors on a grill, not necessarily over a wood fire. Traditionally, in Spain the men are in charge.
Paella Valenciana
1/2 pound dried large lima beans, soaked overnight
1 cup olive oil
1 3 to 3 1/2 pound chicken, cut up
1 2- to 2 1/2 -pound rabbit, cut up
1 3/4 pounds green beans, trimmed
1/2 pound tomatoes, peeled and chopped
2 teaspoons paprika
2 sprigs rosemary (or 12 snails)
Salt
Saffron
5 cups medium grain rice
Boil the lima beans in 1 quart of water for one hour. Drain, reserving both liquid and beans.
Pour oil in the paella pan. Place it over a grill where it will cook, making sure that it is level. Set the fire and light it. When the oil is hot, fry the chicken and the rabbit pieces, turning frequently. Saute the green beans and tomatoes for a few moments. Reduce the heat and immediately pour in 5 quarts of water and the cooking liquid from the lima beans.
Increase the heat and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat to medium, maintaining this level until the meat and other ingredients are cooked. This should take between 45 and 60 minutes.
Add the rosemary, taste for salt and add a small amount of saffron.
For the final 10 minutes, check the level of the broth. It should be at the height of the rivets on the handles. Adjust if there's too much or too little liquid. Increase the intensity of the fire and add the rice, spreading it evenly. Simmer 10 minutes, then reduce heat and cook GENTLY for 8 to 10 more minutes. When the rice is the Spanish equivalent of al dente (soft but not mushy) slide the pan to one side and let it stand five minutes. Rice grains should end up loose and unbroken.
This is a fine dish for outdoor eating - one big pan with many spoons.

Abstract: So it astonished the workers and members at the Falmouth Country Club this week when a greenskeeper found a basketball-sized giant puffball. Doug Baker of the maintenance staff discovered the 6-pound mushroom beneath a pine tree near the 18th tee. He suspected it might be edible, so he brought it to the club's head chef, Vince Barone. Barone stored it in the club's walk-in cooler and called Candice Heydon of Damariscotta. Heydon and her husband do business as Oyster Creek Mushroom Co., supplying wild and rare mushrooms to upscale restaurants all over New England and New York, including Falmouth Country Club.

Full text: Few things grow to maturity on a golf course, where sooner or later every inch of ground is mowed, raked or trampled by golfers.
So it astonished the workers and members at the Falmouth Country Club this week when a greenskeeper found a basketball-sized giant puffball.
Doug Baker of the maintenance staff discovered the 6-pound mushroom beneath a pine tree near the 18th tee. He suspected it might be edible, so he brought it to the club's head chef, Vince Barone.
"It looks like a huge dinosaur egg," Barone said Thursday. "For the last couple or three days, everybody's been wanting to see the mushroom."
Barone stored it in the club's walk-in cooler and called Candice Heydon of Damariscotta. Heydon and her husband do business as Oyster Creek Mushroom Co., supplying wild and rare mushrooms to upscale restaurants all over New England and New York, including Falmouth Country Club.
Over the telephone, Heydon determined Barone had a giant white puffball, an edible mushroom known scientifically as calvatia gigantea.
"I can't imagine it's a record," said her husband, Daniel Heydon, "but it's about as big as they get."
She described it as a choice mushroom, probably worth $7 to $10 a pound in the gourmet restaurant market. "They can be sauteed or batter-fried," she said.
Puffballs are common in Maine pastures, she said. "It's because of manure. Obviously, they've been fertilizing heavily at that golf course."
But Scott Cybulsky, maintenance supervisor at the course, said he wouldn't fertilize in the woods where the mushroom was found. He offered an alternate theory: "The golf course was a dairy farm before it was developed 10 years ago."
Chef Barone has plans for the delicacy. "I think we're going to cut it up into steaks, marinate and grill it, serve it as a side dish, or even as an entree," he said.
"We use a lot of different types of wild mushrooms from Candice," he said. "Many grow in Maine, but I have never seen one this size."
The Heydons said people shouldn't pick wild mushrooms on their own before going out with an expert, to learn which ones are safe to eat. Many mushrooms are poisonous.
"There are thousands of kinds of mushrooms, and there are some look-alikes," said Daniel Heydon. "Don't eat anything you've picked yourself, unless you're absolutely sure."

Full text:   Name: Chris Maloney
Occupation: Hatchery manager, Mook Sea Farm, Inc.
Location: Walpole
Job description: Maloney oversees the birth of tens of millions of oysters, clams and scallops. His charges start out so small, he needs a microscope to see them. The seed, as they're called, are nurtured in briny water filtered from the nearby Damariscotta River. Eventually, the young shellfish are placed in the river itself.
Mook Sea Farm has been in business since 1985. The hatchery produces 120 million shellfish a year, with capacity for triple that. Maloney said growing interest along the East Coast in aquaculture has boosted business noticeably.
Quote: "Even just since last year, the requests for seed orders has just exploded."

Abstract: The municipal budget, as proposed, would decrease by more than $96,000, but the benefits would almost be canceled out by a proposed $94,000 increase in school spending. The tax rate would increase because the town will need to raise $49,000 more in taxes next year, an increase of 3.5 percent. The library has made the same request of Arrowsic, Phippsburg, Woolwich and West Bath. So far, West Bath is the only town meeting that has approved it; Arrowsic's town meeting is scheduled for Wednesday night.

Full text: Residents will face a 31-cent tax increase if they approve all the articles presented at Saturday's town meeting.
The municipal budget, as proposed, would decrease by more than $96,000, but the benefits would almost be canceled out by a proposed $94,000 increase in school spending.
The tax rate would increase because the town will need to raise $49,000 more in taxes next year, an increase of 3.5 percent.
The town meeting is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. Saturday at Georgetown Central School.
The warrant appears to be free of controversial items, except for a funding request from the Patten Free Library in Bath.
The library is asking for $9,322.80 as the first of five annual contributions toward a capital campaign for a planned expansion and renovation. The amount is based on a $51-per-capita figure that the City of Bath has pledged, contingent upon the library's ability to raise money on its own.
The library has made the same request of Arrowsic, Phippsburg, Woolwich and West Bath. So far, West Bath is the only town meeting that has approved it; Arrowsic's town meeting is scheduled for Wednesday night.
Georgetown selectmen are recommending against the article.
The largest jump in the school budget comes from a $56,658 increase in secondary tuition, due to a 3 percent projected increase in the rate and a 10-student increase in enrollment.
The school department also is asking for $10,000 more in its capital reserve fund, which would increase from $70,000 to $80,000.
On the municipal side, the budget is dropping in large part because of the highway department and thesanitation account.
The road commissioner is asking for almost $40,000 less than this year, and the selectmen feel they can get by with a $14,000 reduction in spending for trash hauling, recycling and capital improvements.
The proposed increases are small.
The Financial Advisory Committee is recommending a $6,300 increase in the town officers' salary account.
The town's accountant would receive a raise of $2,320, to $8,320 annually. Don Ludgin, secretary to the selectmen, said the increase was requested because selectmen did not know how many hours the job would entail when they created the position two years ago.
The clerk, who earns $1,000 a year, and the tax collector, who earns $7,500, each have asked for $500 raises, the first they've had in years.
Under administrative expenses, selectmen are seeking to increase their budget for legal expenses from $3,500 to $4,500 so that they will be responsible for all legal expenses in the town. Currently, other committees, such as the Planning Board, carry small legal funds in their own budgets.
The fire department is asking to double the amount the town sets aside to buy their next emergency vehicle. The town raised $5,765 last year; the department is asking for $11,500 this year.
"The fire department is anxious to build up a serious fund for this," Ludgin said.
There also is a request for $4,000 for street signs so the town can prepare for the implementation of Enhanced-911 emergency service when it becomes available.
The warrant also proposes one new ordinance and changes for two existing ordinances:
A new addressing ordinance sets guidelines for establishing street names and addresses that comply with E-911 standards. For example, no two streets may have the same name, such as Pine Road and Pine Lane, or similar-sounding names, such as Beach and Peach streets. All house numbers must be conspicuously displayed.
Proposed changes in the Shellfish Conservation Ordinance would prohibit commercial diggers from obtaining recreational shellfish licenses in Georgetown. According to Ludgin, there is a concern that the diggers may be taking more than the one-peck recreational limit from Georgetown flats in order to sell them elsewhere.
Additions to the ordinance governing town-owned property include a new section on enforcement that allows selectmen to take legal action against violators of the ordinance. GEORGETOWN BUDGET

1995-96 budget: $906,091
1996-97 proposed budget: $809,576

MUNICIPAL TAXES
1995-96 taxes: $437,069

FOOD SCHOLAR MAKES HISTORY ISLEBORO'S SANDRA OLIVER EARNS PRAISE - AND A PRIZE - FOR HER HISTORICAL COOKBOOK

Abstract: "It" is [Sandra] Oliver's recently won Julia Child Award, the equivalent of an Academy Award in the food writing world. Don't let Oliver's humble placement, akin to setting an Oscar next to the john, fool you. Oliver's was one of 12 books to win awards, including "From the Earth to the Table: John Ash's Wine Country Cuisine," which won the cookbook of the year. Oliver won the Jane Grigson award, which is named for the famed British food writer and recognizes distinguished scholarship for cookbooks. The award is unusual in that respect. Food historians have been the stepchildren of both the publishing and academic worlds. Food history is not a bona fide field of study in college history departments, Oliver says. Nor have food historians fit neatly into the cookbook niche. In Oliver's opinion, the award demonstrates that food history has come of age.

Full text: On a small shelf in Sandra Oliver's upstairs bathroom, around the corner from the clawfoot tub, sits a handblown crystal whisk atop a black base.
"I didn't have anywhere to put it," Oliver says, pulling it down to cradle it in her arms.
"It" is Oliver's recently won Julia Child Award, the equivalent of an Academy Award in the food writing world. Don't let Oliver's humble placement, akin to setting an Oscar next to the john, fool you.
"I wanted this more than anything," she confesses.
Oliver won her award for "Saltwater Foodways: New Englanders and Their Food, at Sea and Ashore, in the Nineteenth Century." The oversized, 442-page volume, published in 1995, is half cookbook, half food history.
Oliver's was one of 12 books to win awards, including "From the Earth to the Table: John Ash's Wine Country Cuisine," which won the cookbook of the year. Oliver won the Jane Grigson award, which is named for the famed British food writer and recognizes distinguished scholarship for cookbooks.
The award is unusual in that respect. Food historians have been the stepchildren of both the publishing and academic worlds. Food history is not a bona fide field of study in college history departments, Oliver says. Nor have food historians fit neatly into the cookbook niche. In Oliver's opinion, the award demonstrates that food history has come of age.
"I felt really happy for my field," Oliver says.
Loading a log through the top of her cast-iron cookstove, Oliver, 48, looks the 19th-century matron. Her hair is knotted atop her head. As the heatrises from the stove, loose strands dance around her face. She shifts a pot of cream of asparagus soup ("there's no recipe for it, I just made it up") to the back of the stove where it is the hottest.
Her kitchen in her Islesboro farm house still has its original cupboards, looking a little worse for the wear, and a cast-iron sink. In the garden outside, she grows enough potatoes, beets and onions to last through each winter. She also grows other fruits and vegetables, including asparagus and raspberries.
"One of my goals is to see if I can get sick of raspberries," she says laughing.
A circular pen of gray lumber stands empty behind the raspberry bramble. A few years ago she and her husband, Jamie MacMillan, raised their own hogs for meat, but befriended them instead. Having them butchered was a painful experience, so for now the pen is vacant.
Although earlier ways of cooking and living influence Oliver, she's no purist. A Kitchen Aid mixer sits on her counter near Julia Child's bible, "The Way to Cook." Half of her cookstove runs on gas. Humus and tabbouleh figure more prominently in her cooking than johnnycakes or salt cod.
A fireplace laboratory
Oliver decided to be a writer when she was 10, but her passion for food and history came later. Short of funds and troubled by the turmoil of the times, she dropped out of the University of Connecticut in 1969. She became a typist in the photo lab at Mystic Seaport. When the museum asked her to develop a fireplace-cooking demonstration program, she jumped at the chance to escape the subterranean quarters of the photo lab.
"It shows where food history was at the time to ask a college drop-out with no history background to do this," Oliver says.
Oliver grew up in the hyper-convenient 1950s in a household full of cake mixes and canned vegetables. "I could make macaroni and cheese," she says. "I really learned how to cook over a fire."
She spent two months at Sturbridge Village, the historical village museum in Massachusetts, studying the fireplace cooking program and paging through their historical cookbooks. Back at Mystic Seaport, she had the techniques cookbooks. Back at Mystic Seaport, she had the techniques down in about six months.
"It's cooking with all your senses," she says. "It's very sensual . . . It's made me much more open to anything and I have a sense of freedom. I feel like under any circumstances, given a fire I can cook. I never have to worry about the power going out."
Early on, Oliver beganworking on a cookbook connected to the hearth program. It evolved into a much broader, and scholarly project over the years, but one she had trouble concentrating on as she returned to college to complete a history degree and her duties expanded at Mystic Seaport.
In 1985 she left the museum to focus on her writing. Oliver and her husband, who grew up in Belfast, moved to Islesboro. They eventually settled into a roomy, white clapboard on the north end of the island, which they now share with their teen-age nephew.
In between scraping out a living with cooking jobs (she baked at the Dark Harbor Inn) and starting a food history newsletter, Oliver worked on and off on the book. She commuted to Mystic and Boston for her research work.
In the early '90s, the museum was able to give her an advance that allowed her to focus on the book full-time for two years. She completed it in the fall of '94.
"Some people get postpartum depression when they finish a book," Oliver says. "I didn't. We had a party with champagne to send off the last diskette."
A time of change
During the 19th century cooking technology and food supplies changed radically, influencing what and how people ate throughout the region.
At the beginning of 1900s in New England a woman did all her cooking and baking over a fire; used molasses as a sweetener and saved costly cane sugar for special occasions; made bread with corn meal and rye; and preserved all her own food. The noon-time meal was the largest of the day.
A hundred years later, cookstoves could be found in every kitchen; sugar was cheap and granulated; white flour from the Great Plains was plentiful; commercially canned food was available and the main meal of the day had shifted to the evening.
"It really was the beginning of now," Oliver says. "Modern people are so convinced that so much of what we think of modern is really recent and it isn't. We are living with stuff that has been around for over 100 years."
Her book is organized around Mystic Seaport's exhibits, describing in details the cooking and eating habits of real people represented by the museum. Oliver explores the fireplace cooking of Lydia Buckingham, the Colonial wife of a farmer in Saybrook, Conn., and the grocery lists of Charlotte Rogers Greenman, a prosperous Victorian lady in Stonington, Conn.
Oliver also charts the evolution of various holiday foods and New England traditions such as the clam bake and chowder parties, which both came into being in the 19th century.
Interspersed with all the history, which is detailed but not academic in style, are plenty of historical recipes that Oliver has adapted for modern cooks: pineapple preserves, thirded bread, oyster fritters, roasted goose and snow pudding.
In her book, Oliver also debunks a number of regional myths, such as baked beans were not cooked with molasses, meaning they weren't sweet, until the latter half of the 19th century. The most striking one is how New Englanders, like most of the rest of the country, heldfish in low esteem. They considered it not hearty or nutritional enough, Oliver says. They preferred beef by a long shot.
"For all New Englanders make a fuss about fish, with a cod on the Massachusetts Statehouse and a lobster on the Maine license, actually fish was a controversial food," she says. "New Englanders ate it once a week unless they were poor."
Since winning the award in late April, Oliver has embarked on another book tour. She has some ideas she's working on for another book, but evades discussing them, confessing she's afraid of jinxing them.
For now she's still riding high from her 15 minutes of fame at the ceremony in New York City last month.
"It was like having a baby," she says. "When you carry around a baby everybody smiles at you. When you carry around a crystal whisk everybody smiles at you."
HERE ARE SOME of the historical recipes that Sandra Oliver cooks at home from her book "Saltwater Foodways," $39.95, published by Mystic Seaport Museum. The book includes the original recipes, but the ones listed below have been interpreted by Oliver for a modern cook.
Coconut Cake
Coconut Cake was a prominent kind of cake in the last quarter of the 19th century and early 20th century, according to Oliver. Using freshly grated coconut is the best way to make this cake.
1 cup butter
2 cups sugar
3 cups flour
4 egg whites
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 small coconut grated or the equivalent of 2 1/2 cups
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease two 8-inch pans and line with waxed paper. Sift together the dry ingredients. In another bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the milk. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Mix in the grated coconut. Beat the egg whites stiff. Fold the whites into the batter and gently pour into the cakes pan. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
For the frosting Oliver offers a recipe from the Dinner Year Book published in 1878 - "1 grated coconut, to 1/2 of this add whites of 3 eggs beaten to a froth and 1 cup powdered sugar. Lay this between the layers. Mix with other half of coconut, 4 tablespoons sugar and strew thickly on top."
Corn Oysters
Corn oysters look like fried oysters, Oliver writes. Making these fritters, best made with fresh corn, are an annual summer tradition for the writer.
2 cups grated fresh sweet corn
1 egg beaten
3/4 cup flour
1/4 cup cream or milk
1 teaspoon salt
Mix together corn, egg and milk. Add the flour gradually. Drop by tablespoonfuls into deep fat or on a very well oiled griddle and fry quickly. Drain on paper and keep warm in oven till served. Yields about a dozen.
Chocolate Ice Cream
In the 19th-century vanilla and fruit-flavored ice creams were more popular than chocolate, but the later was not overlooked. Oliver interpreted this recipe from the 1882 "Practical Cooking and Dinner Giving."
2 cups milk
1 cup sugar
6 egg yolks
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate or a scant 2/3 cups cocoa
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon gelatin dissolved in 2 tablespoons hot water
2 cups cream
Scald the milk in a double boiler or heavy saucepan. Remove from heat. Dissolve the sugar in the milk. Beat the egg yolks and add a bit of the hot milk to them, stirring to blend, then gradually add that mixture to the rest of the scalded milk.
Melt the chocolate or mix the cocoa with a little hot water. Stir and keep hot until the chocolate melts; add to the custard in the double boiler. Add the dissolved gelatin to the hot milk, and cook over hot water until thickened as for custard. Add the vanilla. Chill overnight.
When you are ready to freeze the ice cream, whip the cream until it holds a soft peak and fold it into the chilled custard. Pour into ice cream maker. Churn, following the instruction for using your freezer, until the ice cream is frozen. Yields on half gallon.
Graham Bread
Sylvester Graham (1794-1851), a Presbyterian minister from Philadelphia, denounced white bread as pernicious and advocated whole grain flour, which become known as Graham flour.
This bread is slow-rising, so mixing it and allowing it to rise overnight is not a bad idea.
2 cups Graham flour
2 tablespoons molasses
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup scalded milk
1 cup water
1/2 yeast cake
1 1/2 -2 cups whole wheat flour
Scald milk and add the cold water. When just warm to touch, dissolve yeast cake in the mixture. Add molasses.
Mix Graham flour and salt in a large bowl, add milk mixture, and beat for several strokes. Add whole wheat flour, about half a cup at a time, and continue to mix, using the back of a spoon, until the flour is all mixed in and dough is stiff. Don't knead.
Let rise overnight or several hours if in a cool place, less time if in a warm place. When risen, punch down, and knead, adding as little flour as you can, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Put into one large or two small greased loaf pans. Let rise one to two hours.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bake for ten minutes at 425 degrees then reduce oven to 350 degrees for 45 minutes, or until the bread is golden and sounds hollow when you tap it. Yield on large or two small loaves.

Coconut cake was a popular cake, made with freshly grated coconut, in the last quarter of the 19th century, especially for picnics. Picnics were a relatively new idea in 19th century America, but quickly became popular, especially for the Fourth of July. Transporting and keeping the food from spoiling required that meats be cooked, salted or smoked, such as this meal of boiled ham, chicken salad and cold, stuffed eggs. p2C

FINAL BRUNSWICK BUDGET BOOSTS TAXES BY 3 PERCENT A $30,000 SIDEWALK IS CUT - BUT IT MAY GET BUILT ANYWAY.

Author: Dennis Hoey Staff Writer

Abstract: The Town Council on Monday night adopted a $30.3 million school and municipal budget, which will increase the tax rate by 3.17 percent, to $19.50 per $1,000 of assessed value from $18.90. The owner of a home valued at $100,000 will pay about $60 more a year. Last week, Town Manager Donald Gerrish and School Superintendent James Ashe presented the council with budgets that were $675,000 lower than their original requests. The administrators were complying with a council mandate requiring them to reduce the tax increase from 6.9 percent to 3.17 percent. That meeting was followed by a sparsely attended public hearing last Thursday, at which residents and councilors debated the needs for a new natural resources director and a new sidewalk for Charles Court.

Full text:   Property owners will see their taxes increase by 3 percent next year but will not have to withstand any major cuts in services.
The Town Council on Monday night adopted a $30.3 million school and municipal budget, which will increase the tax rate by 3.17 percent, to $19.50 per $1,000 of assessed value from $18.90. The owner of a home valued at $100,000 will pay about $60 more a year.
Last week, Town Manager Donald Gerrish and School Superintendent James Ashe presented the council with budgets that were $675,000 lower than their original requests. The administrators were complying with a council mandate requiring them to reduce the tax increase from 6.9 percent to 3.17 percent.
That meeting was followed by a sparsely attended public hearing last Thursday, at which residents and councilors debated the needs for a new natural resources director and a new sidewalk for Charles Court.
The new position remains in the budget. The sidewalk is out.
"Although not everyone on the council is satisfied, we have been able to keep the services that Brunswick people demand," Stephen McCausland, council chairman, said before Monday's meeting.
Some of that dissatisfaction was reflected in Monday night's 6-3 vote. Clement Wilson, Leon Laffely and Ervin Snyder voted against the budget for different reasons.
Wilson and Laffely said it is inappropriate to add a new position at a time when other municipalities are shrinking government. Snyder said he wanted more money for school building maintenance and repair.
The council majority approved $33,000 in salary and benefits for a new natural resources director, who will focus more on management of the town's marine resources than on enforcement. Enforcement of shellfish regulations would be handled by a Brunswick police officer, under the proposal developed by Gerrish.
As it is now, Alan Houston handles both duties as Brunswick's marine warden, a police employee. He has said he plans to retire and may apply for the job of marine resources director.
"The thing that troubles me is we're breaking new ground at a time when we probably shouldn't be," Wilson said.
Wilson said he remains concerned that the budget adopted by the council does not include $30,000 for a new sidewalk on Charles Court. Gerrish chopped it from the budget to comply with the council order.
"Let's think of the safety of the kids first," said Laffely, who suggested the town hold off for one year on hiring the natural resources director and use the money to build the sidewalk.
Gerrish indicated there may be money available later in the year to build a sidewalk - from the town's capital projects fund.
Students from Jordan Acres Elementary School are not supposed to walk in the narrow street, because of the danger from moving vehicles. A sidewalk on Charles Court would have fixed that problem.
Snyder said he was disturbed that cuts in the school department's capital budget will affect school building renovations and additions.
After the meeting, Wilson said he thinks the 6-3 vote is healthy. It demonstrates that there is room for differences of opinion and that the council represents all of the townspeople, not just a select few, he said.
"Despite the 6-3 vote, I feel as though we've worked well together," McCausland said. "We were able to reduce the tax increase by more than half of what was originally proposed."

Abstract: As chef de cuisine for the cruise ship Island Breeze, Anthony Allen oversees a kitchen that churns out three meals a day plus a buffet for 1,400 passengers and 550 crew members every day. In the course of the week, his kitchen cooks up 2,500 pounds of seafood. A portion of that seafood goes into a New England classic - Seafood Newburg. The dish is served on Monday evening during the boat's five-day cruise from New York City, Portland, Halifax and back to New York City. The bespectacled, British chef, 36, uses Maine lobster for the dish. Despite the boat's call in port here, the crustaceans are loaded onto the boat in New York City. This version of Newburg has some untraditional touches such as the tomato puree, mushrooms and the brandy.

Full text: As chef de cuisine for the cruise ship Island Breeze, Anthony Allen oversees a kitchen that churns out three meals a day plus a buffet for 1,400 passengers and 550 crew members every day. In the course of the week, his kitchen cooks up 2,500 pounds of seafood.
A portion of that seafood goes into a New England classic - Seafood Newburg. The dish is served on Monday evening during the boat's five-day cruise from New York City, Portland, Halifax and back to New York City.
The bespectacled, British chef, 36, uses Maine lobster for the dish. Despite the boat's call in port here, the crustaceans are loaded onto the boat in New York City. This version of Newburg has some untraditional touches such as the tomato puree, mushrooms and the brandy.
It also has a load of liquor in it. You can use less sherry - a few tablespoons - if you want. In that case don't reduce it. Also, this recipe has been adapted in part from Allen's, which gave measurements in weight - the European tradition - rather than cups. This recipe, which calls for flambeing, is not for a beginning cook.
During the boat's stop in Portland Tuesday, Allen dashed to a waterfront fish store to pick up some lobsters to cook for himself and a few of the crew members.
"I'm going to cook it a la Americaine withgarlic, white wine, brandy and fresh tomatoes," Allen said. "It's a surprise dinner for the maitre d' who is leaving."

SAILING SHIPS PROVIDE SOFT ADVENTURE PASSENGERS ON MAINE'S EXTENSIVE FLEET OF WINDJAMMERS CAN ACT AS CREW TO HELP SAIL THE SHIP. OR THEY CAN JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH THE GLORIOUS MAINE COAST.

Abstract: Originally, many of the ships were created to deliver lumber, fish, ice and granite. Many of the schooners traveled the seas bringing back treasures of rum, sugar and molasses. The cruises have expanded since the 1930s, when Frank Swift and Capt. Ralph Gott conceived the first successful Maine Windjammer, Lydia M. Webster. And Swift came up with the idea of Windjammer Cruising. The Isaac H. Evans, a National Historic Landmark, is celebrating its 110th year. The ship spent many years on the Delaware Bay, oyster fishing and freighting. It was rebuilt in 1973 for passenger trade, and offers three-seven day cruises for $335-$675. It also offers a three day family cruise for kids (8 and up) to help show kids what life at sea was like. They spend more time on shore exploring and do more family activities and even serve peanut butter sandwiches, in addition to their seafood and other more "adult" foods.

On your last vacation did you relax or did you worry about fighting traffic? Did you experience Maine at its best?
Quiet coves, cozy harbors, whales, seals. Colorful sunrises, blazing sunsets, a sky packed with twinkling stars so numerous you can't get your breath. The lap of the waves lulls you to sleep, the breakfast bell awakens you to a hearty breakfast of steaming coffee,french toast, sausages, fruit.
After breakfast, you can help hoist up the heavy canvas main sail, attached to the 80 foot mast. It's such an overpowering sight, your heart pounds with excitement and admiration as the wind sets your course.
For those who want to smell, feel and treasure the essence of Maine, a Maine windjammer cruise is the ultimate experience. No telephones, fax machines and no traffic to fight. For about $100 a day per person everything is included, including an all-you-caneat lobster feed on a sandy shore.
On June 28 at the conclusion of the Governor's Cup race, Gov. Angus King will proclaim July as Maine Windjammer Month, as the industry celebrates it's 60th anniversary.
Originally, many of the ships were created to deliver lumber, fish, ice and granite. Many of the schooners traveled the seas bringing back treasures of rum, sugar and molasses. The cruises have expanded since the 1930s, when Frank Swift and Capt. Ralph Gott conceived the first successful Maine Windjammer, Lydia M. Webster. And Swift came up with the idea of Windjammer Cruising.
According to Malli Gero, public relations director at North End Shipyard Schooners in Rockland, many people from Maine don't know about Windjammers, an affordable soft vacation adventure in their own backyard.
A windjamming cruise vacation can take the form of a weekend, three- or seven-day trip. Passengers are encouraged (not forced) to help hoist sails, navigate, take the wheel or help in the galley.
They can learn how the ship operates, or sit back and enjoy the ride. Whales, puffins and seals are often spotted, so guests are encouraged to bring cameras and binoculars. Exploring the islands, delicious food and a relaxed atmosphere that remind you of life at sea combine to bring passengers back year after year. All 18 vessels offer comfortable accommodations with hot showers.
The Mercantile, part of the original Windjammer Cruise fleet, offers weekend cruise packages and four- and seven-day cruises for $495-695.
The Schooner Grace Bailey, built in 1882 and restored in 1990, offers six-day cruises for $595-$695.
The Mistress, a blend of schooner and yacht, accommodates a smaller group of six passengers, rounding out the original Maine Windjammer Cruises. The three vessels take passengers beginning with Memorial Day weekend until Oct. 4 for fall foliage.
The Isaac H. Evans, a National Historic Landmark, is celebrating its 110th year. The ship spent many years on the Delaware Bay, oyster fishing and freighting. It was rebuilt in 1973 for passenger trade, and offers three-seven day cruises for $335-$675. It also offers a three day family cruise for kids (8 and up) to help show kids what life at sea was like. They spend more time on shore exploring and do more family activities and even serve peanut butter sandwiches, in addition to their seafood and other more "adult" foods.
The American Eagle is the place to be this summer if racing is in your blood. The American Eagle is scheduled to race in August in the Gloucester Schooner Race in Gloucester, Mass. Capt. John Foss offers both three day and six day cruises ($395-$675.)on the 92 foot vessel.
"People from all walks of life take a trip like this," Foss said. "For some it's the history of the vessel, for others it's a step back in time when people traveled by ship to get to their destinations. Wedding or honeymoon, it's the ultimate escapist vacation without being too far away."
The third ship in the North End Shipyard Schooners in Rockland is the 95 foot Heritage. Built in 1983 in the tradition of a 19th century coaster, Capts. Doug and Linda Lee offer week-long cruises ( $595-675.) exclusively to explore the waters and islands between Portland and Acadia National Park.
The Victory Chimes, the only 3-masted schooner to survive the golden age of sail now makes her home in Rockland. After being purchased in 1988 by Domino's Pizza, she went through a three year refurbishing. In 1990, she was purchased by Capt. Kip Files and Capt. Paul DeGaeta, and rechristened the Victory Chimes. The 96-year-old schooner provides weekend to one week cruises ($375-$725). Files has a Master of Oceans license for large sailing vessels. DeGaeta has been a professional yacht captain, and was in charge of the restoration of the vessel for the then named Domino Effect.
The Stephen Taber is the oldest schooner in continuous service. It will be 125 years old this summer, and Capts. Ken and Ellen Barnes are planning a birthday bash to celebrate. They have two three-day trips planned, one Memorial Day weekend, and one at the end of the season for fall foliage, as well as their week-long trips.
"We take out 22 `friends' every week," said Ellen Barnes. "Seventy-five percent of our business is repeat business. Perhaps my husband's bagpipe music is partly responsible."
If you don't have three days to vacation, you still can go windjamming for a day. The Windameen of Rockland takes one-day cruises ($143) out of Rockland.
"We take 14 guests out seven days a week from around the middle of June to the end of September," said Capt. Neal Parker. "We also are able to take parents with children because it's only a one day-overnight cruise, and we don't let them get bored."
All meals are included, and Parker suggests letting children bring books and binoculars for the evening.
You don't need to worry about getting sea sick on a windjammer cruise, since the vessels sail within the protected waters of Maine, not out at sea. You should pack lightly- bring casual clothes, and something warm, rubber soled shoes (2 pair if possible) raingear, a swim suit, camera.

In addition to opening new territory - canoes are traditionally considered freshwater-only - tidewater offers glimpses of nature's wondrous intertidal zone: home, nesting areas, feeding ground or areas frequently visited by scores of birds, fish and shellfish. Planning your trip around the tidal cycle is key; anyone who has ever paddled against a three-knot tidal current never does it again.

Time and tide wait for no one. But canoeists know that it's often worth waiting some time to catch the tide just right, because sheltered tidewater explorations through Maine's myriad saltwater rivers and estuaries are among the state's most rewarding adventures.
In addition to opening new territory - canoes are traditionally considered freshwater-only - tidewater offers glimpses of nature's wondrous intertidal zone: home, nesting areas, feeding ground or areas frequently visited by scores of birds, fish and shellfish.
Planning your trip around the tidal cycle is key; anyone who has ever paddled against a three-knot tidal current never does it again.
If putting in and returning to the same spot, plan the route so you reach your destination at high or low tide, when the current reverses.
If you are making a one-way trip, time the put-in to take advantage of the current.
There are several excellent elementary texts on tides and currents. The best is "Chapman's Piloting," by Elbert S. Maloney. It has an entire chapter on tides and currents.
Daily tide predictions for Portland are published widely, in almanacs, calendars, television news reports, this paper and the taped weather report (688-3210).
If all you have is today's tide, and you'd like to predict ahead, the following rules are roughly accurate for a few days.
The tide changes approximately every 6 hours, 13 minutes. This means, for example, that if high tide is 12 noon, a low will follow at 6:13 p.m. and another high will occur at 12:25 a.m. the following morning.
The full daily cycle changes by 50 minutes. Thus, if there's a low tide at noon, lows occur at 12:50 p.m. the following day and 1:40 p.m. the day after.
Another important point: Fastest currents flow halfway between high and low tides.
Here are some suggestions for pleasant tidewater canoe explorations that are safe for open boats and paddlers with some experience. Except where suggested put-ins are given, all have at least one official public access marked on the DeLorme Maine Atlas.
Canoes, paddles, life vests and cartop pads can be rented ($25 per day) from Norumbega Outfitters, 58 Fore St. in Portland. Call 773-0910.
Presumpscot River, Portland and Falmouth, 6-plus miles. Put in on the Portland end of the Martin's Point Bridge. Few spots in Maine boast as much history as this broad estuary; much of it is found in the "Presumpscot River Guide" published by Presumpscot River Watch.
Scarborough Marsh, 6-plus miles. Rent canoes at the Audubon Nature Center or put in your own at Pine Point. Three coastal rivers - the Scarborough, Libby and Nonesuch - converge in this huge salt marsh, Maine's largest.
Cousins River-Royal River-Lanes Island, Yarmouth, 6-plus miles. The Cousins River is a classic small salt marsh. A guided canoe tour led by Norumbega and Maine Audubon goes June 1. Call 781-2330.
Kennebunk River, Kennebunk and Kennebunkport, 6-plus miles. Put in and park (fee charged) just above the Route 9 Bridge between the two towns on the 'Port side. One of the gentlest tidewater explorations on the coast.
Salt Bay-Damariscotta River, Damariscotta and Newcastle, 10-plus miles. If you'd like to add some easy whitewater to your canoeing adventure, try the Damariscotta Reversing Falls, just below the Route 1 bridge.
Robinhood Cove-Sasanoa River-Back River-Sheepscot River, Georgetown to Wiscasset, 20-plus miles. Ambitious canoeists who ride the tides right can circumnavigate Westport Island or try myriad other options.

MOVE OVER CLAMS, MUSSELS ARE IN EUROPEANS LOVE SWEET, PLUMP MUSSELS STEAMED IN WINE; NOW AMERICANS ARE REDISCOVERING THIS VERSATILE SHELLFISH

Abstract: For the 12 years [Bernard] Davodet, who grew up eating his French mother's home-cooked mussels in broth, owned the Bay View Street Garage in Camden, he didn't bother to put the blue-black mollusk on the menu. By the time he bought the Harbor View in 1990, though, he noticed tastes had changed. His mussels served in wine broth with cream have been one of the restaurant's most popular dishes for the past six years. Despite the salesmanship, he's got a point. Mussels, especially cultivated ones, cook up in minutes and preparation can be as simple as loading them into a pot, adding wine, fresh parsley, chopped onion and salt and pepper. Pile them up in a moat of broth, add a crusty loaf of bread and dinner's ready. Mussel consumption has grown as more and more cultivated mussels have been available. The problem with wild mussels is they like a crowd. Growing in clumps makesthem smaller, as the tiny fellows compete for food. Cultivated mussels are given room to grown and are cultivated at sub-tidal depths, which allows them to feed all day and fatten up. Cultivated mussels are tenderer and easier to clean.

Prized in Europe, mussels were long dismissed as bait on this side of the Atlantic.
"(Americans) thought they were garbage," says Bernard Davodet, the Paris-born chef and owner of the Harbor View Tavern on Thomaston's public landing. "I was surprised that clams that live in ugly, disgusting mud were popular but mussels that live on the rocks weren't."
For the 12 years Davodet, who grew up eating his French mother's home-cooked mussels in broth, owned the Bay View Street Garage in Camden, he didn't bother to put the blue-black mollusk on the menu. By the time he bought the Harbor View in 1990, though, he noticed tastes had changed. His mussels served in wine broth with cream have been one of the restaurant's most popular dishes for the past six years.
The plump, sweet mussel finally is getting its due in American cuisine. Mussels still have not made the Top 10 list of America's favorite fish and seafood compiled by the National Fisheries Institute, but production and imports are up, says Rob Lovitt, managing editor of Seafood Leader, a trade publication based in Seattle, Wash.
Sales surged in the early '80s for The Great Eastern Mussel Farms in St. George, North America's largest mussel harvester, and have grown steadily by 10 percent a year since 1990, the company reports..
The mussel has benefited from the growing cost of clams, which can be double the price or more, especially in summer when tourists are noshing on seafood up and down the coast. Mussels also are more consistently available and the cultivated ones are usually less gritty than clams.
Terence Callery, the indefatigable national sales rep forGreat Eastern Mussel Farms, can reel off mussel trivia with zeal usually reserved for sport statistics. He calls the bivalves "nature's original fast food."
Despite the salesmanship, he's got a point. Mussels, especially cultivated ones, cook up in minutes and preparation can be as simple as loading them into a pot, adding wine, fresh parsley, chopped onion and salt and pepper. Pile them up in a moat of broth, add a crusty loaf of bread and dinner's ready.
They can also be fried, smoked, baked, stuffed or stewed.
But the main reason to give mussels a try is the taste - a subtle yin yang mix of buttery sweetness and the fresh brininess of the sea. Mussels are usually the right size to pop in your mouth whole without any embarrassment. Equally persuasive is the broth they are typically served in, which makes for great dunking with French bread.
European favorites
Mussel lore has it that 700 years ago a shipwrecked Irish sailor planted poles in tidal flats and stretched nets between themto catch seabirds. Soon the black shells were creeping up the poles.
Mussels show up in dishes across Europe, in Spain's paella, Italy's cioppino and France's bouillabaisse. In certain coastal regions of France and Belgium, per capita consumption is 15 pounds of mussels a year, as much as Americans eat in seafood a year, according to Callery.
They are also widely eaten in Asia, where in Thailand they are served with green curry paste. In Japan they are eaten raw at sushi bars.
Mussels were eaten by the Pilgrims and mentioned in early American cookbooks. Then, they virtually disappear from 19th-century American cookbooks.
According to "Saltwater Foodways," written by the Islesboro resident and food historian, Sandra Oliver, mussels got a bad rap in this country as being poisonous. These small water pumps, that filter between 15 to 20 gallons of water a day, can be contaminated by pollutants, especially the toxic planktons that cause "red tide."
In the early 20th century a number of efforts were taken to promote them, including government campaigns during each World War.
When Great Eastern started up in 1977, the only reliable market for mussels were Italians neighborhoods on the Eastern seaboard. That began to change in the 1980s when health benefits of seafood, which is low-fat and high in protein, were widely reported.
Mussel consumption has grown as more and more cultivated mussels have been available. The problem with wild mussels is they like a crowd. Growing in clumps makesthem smaller, as the tiny fellows compete for food. Cultivated mussels are given room to grown and are cultivated at sub-tidal depths, which allows them to feed all day and fatten up. Cultivated mussels are tenderer and easier to clean.
Most of Great Eastern's mussels are harvested in the cool waters Down East on beds the company leases from the State of Maine and then cultivates. The company also harvests wild mussels, but from beds on par with their cultivated ones.
Eight to 10 semis pull up to the Great Eastern Mussel Farms on the shore of Long Cove on a given day and dump their clattering, brackish loads into 20,000 gallon tanks of sea water. There the mussels will clean themselves, before being stored and packed for shipping.
The company mostly sells their mussels to large distributors and supermarkets, but a few local restaurants, such as the Harbor View, buy their mussels there.
Down Route 136 from Great Eastern, Uta Kohn smokes the company's meaty mollusks for several hours over a smoldering fire of hard and fruits woods. The meats, bathed in a spiced oil, are the most popular item at Kohn's smokehouse.
"People call them pop-Kohn," says Kohn. "They eat them one right after the other."
THIS RECIPE was devised by Rebecca Reilly, during her days as chef/owner of the Madd Apple Cafe on Forest Avenue. She contributed it to "The Great Eastern Mussel Cookbook," which is packed with mussel know-how and recipes Terrence Callery, the company's sales rep, collected over the years.
Portuguese Mussel Stew
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 28-ounce can plum tomatoes
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
Pinch crushed hot red pepper
12 small new potatoes, boil until soft
1 pound Linguica or Chourico sausage, in 1/4 inch slice (Polish sausage can be substituted)
4 pounds mussels
Heat oil in large pot. Gently saute garlic, add tomatoes, juice and all. Stir in basil and pepper. Simmer 20 minutes. Add potatoes and sausage slices - heat through. Add mussels. Cover and steam until shells open. Serve in bowls with crusty bread. Serves 6.
- From "The Great Eastern Mussel Cookbook," Paul S. Eriksson, publisher, Forest Dale, Vt., $14.95.
THIS IS THE classic way to eat mussels in France and Belgium. Be sure to serve it with crusty French bread for dunking in the broth. This is from James Peterson's new cookbook, "Fish & Shellfish."
Steamed Mussels with White Wine and Parsley
6 pounds mussels, preferably small cultivated
2 cups dry white wine
3 shallots, finely chopped
1 Turkish bay leaf
2 fresh thyme sprigs or 1/2 teaspoon dried
3 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
1/4 pound unsalted butter (optional)
Pepper
Wash and sort the mussels, pulling off any pieces of protruding beard.
Combine the wine, shallots, bay leaf, and thyme in a 10 quarts pot and bring to a slow simmer over medium heat. Simmer for about 5 minutes, then add the mussels, cover the pot, and turn the heat up to high.
When steam starts to shoot out from under the lid, turn the heat back down to medium. Leave the pot on the heat for 5 minutes more. Shake the pot - holding down the lid with a kitchen towel - to redistribute the mussels. Put the pot back on the heat for 2 minutes more. Take off the lid and check to see if all the mussels have opened. If not, replace the lid and cook for 2 minutes more.
Remove the lid, wait a minute for the steam to dissipate, scoop the mussels out of the pot with a large spoon or skimmer, andplace them in hot bowls, discarding any unopened mussels. If the liquid in the bottom of the pan is sandy, carefully pour it into a clean saucepan, leaving any sand or grit behind. Add the chopped parsley to the hot broth, whisk in the butter if desired, and season with pepper. Heat the broth for a minute or two and ladle it over the hot mussels.
JERRY CLARE, chef/owner of The Belmont Inn and Restaurant in Camden, contributed this recipe to "The Great Eastern Mussel Cookbook" with the following explanation: "After spending several weeks in Thailand in 1990, I became quite fond of the food and the wonderful herbs and spices that gave it a sweet, sour, citrus, clean flavor. And it was low fat. Returning as chef of the Belmont, I wanted to combine these flavors with local seafood."
Stir-fry Mussels, Thailand
3 tablespoons oil
4 tablespoons fermented black beans
2 tablespoons Thai chili paste
4 tablesoons hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons fresh ginger, minced
2 tablespoons lemon grass, minced
1 tablespoon sugar
2 pounds mussels
1 tablespoon Thai fish sauce
Juice of 1 lime
2 tablespoons red bell pepper, minced, for garnish
1 cup scallions, cut on slant
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
Serves 6
In a large saute pan heat the oil over high heat. Add the black beans, chili paste, hoisin sauce, ginger, lemon grass and sugar. Cook one minute, stirring to blend all ingredients. Add mussels all at once, shaking the pan to coat them. Add the fish sauce and lime juice into the pan. Cover and cook for five minutes until the shells have opened. Pour onto a large platter and garnish with red pepper, scallions and cilantro.
Cold Mussels in Salsa
This recipe, another from Peterson's book, combines Mexican ingredients with mussels for a first course.
36 medium to large mussels
(about 2 1/4 to 3 pounds)
1/2 cup water
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
2 poblano chilies, peeled, seeded, and chopped
1 small onion, finely chopped
Juice of 2 limes
2 tablespoons finely chopped
fresh cilantro
2 jalapeno chilies, seeded and finely chopped
4 canned chipolte chilies, drained, seeded and finely
chopped (available in specialty markets)
1 tomato, peeled, seeded and chopped
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
salt
In a covered pot large enough to hold the opened mussels, steam the mussels in the water for 5 to 10 minutes. Save the liquid for another recipe, take the mussels out of the shells and discard half the shells and any unopened mussels.
Crush the garlic to a paste in a mortar and pestle or on a cutting board with the side of a chef's knife.
Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl, season to taste with salt and let sit in refrigerator for at least two hours..
Just before serving, stir the salsa and spoon about a teaspoon into each mussel shell, place a mussel on top, and spoon on another teaspoon or two of salsa. Serve chilled. Makes six first-course serving.

You can gather your own mussels, but be sure to collect them in an area that has tested safe for pollution and "red tide."
To get the best mussels, forage during a moon or drain tide, which will uncover beds that are exposed infrequently. Also, pick younger mollusks, which will be between two to three inches long with shiny black shells.
In a store, the key to buying mussels is to get live ones. Avoid any that are open more than a quarter inch. If they are open slightly, knock them together. They should close if they are alive.
To store, put a few ice cubes in the top of the bag. Set the bag in a sieve, and set the sieve in a bowl to catch the melting water. The idea is keep mussels moist and cool, but not to drown them.
Pull out the beard - that short tuft of hairs sticking out the shell - shortly before cooking. Pinch it between thumb and forefinger and give a yank. As you put them in the pot, keep an eye out for any dead mussels. If shells feel especially light, there's probably nothing inside. If they are extra heavy, they are probably filled with mud.
Most mussel dishes begin with steaming them open in a little liquid, often wine, over high heat. Load them into a pot where the mussels come no higher than three quarters up the side. Once the mussels have opened, Bernard Davodet, chef and owner of the Harbor View Tavern in Thomaston, steams them for one more minute. The broth can be enriched with cream, eggs, a roux or homemade mayonnaise.
To his wine broth, he adds parsley, onions and plenty of salt, because he finds Maine mussels to not be briny enough.
"They need some help," Davodet says.

Abstract: Brunswick and Harpswell officials will meet today to try to resolve who owns 200 acres of prime clam flats. Selectmen from the town of Harpswell are expected to make a new boundary claim, based on research into historical records that date back to the 1700s. The research project, conducted by a citizens' watchdog group in conjunction with a Portland law firm, cost Harpswell more than $10,000. Interest in the boundary heightened after Harpswell voters in 1993 terminated a reciprocal clam digging agreement with Brunswick and West Bath. The agreement permitted diggers from each town to cross town lines to dig for clams.

Full text:   Brunswick and Harpswell officials will meet today to try to resolve who owns 200 acres of prime clam flats.
Selectmen from the town of Harpswell are expected to make a new boundary claim, based on research into historical records that date back to the 1700s. The research project, conducted by a citizens' watchdog group in conjunction with a Portland law firm, cost Harpswell more than $10,000.
Interest in the boundary heightened after Harpswell voters in 1993 terminated a reciprocal clam digging agreement with Brunswick and West Bath. The agreement permitted diggers from each town to cross town lines to dig for clams.
After the agreement ended, enforcement became an issue. Clam wardens wanted to know exactly where the boundary line was so they could enforce local shellfish regulations.
The towns hired a surveyor. But, before the surveyor could place boundary monuments in the mud, a group of Harpswell residents - known as the "Venetians" - argued that historical research into land deeds should be done before markers were erected.
"We feel the town line is now near where it shows on topography maps," said George Barnes, a member of the Venetians, which he says means hunting dogs in Latin.
Barnes said his group conducted extensive research on its own. They shared their findings with the law firm. Harpswell selectmen will present the results of the study at today's meeting.
"We're going to ask them to draw their line in the sand and we'll draw ours. If they disagree then it will go to court," Robert Webber, chairman of the Harpswell Board of Selectmen, said.
Webber says there are several points along the boundary - involving between 100 and 200 acres - which are now in question. He identified those areas as being mud flats along Mere Point, White Island and Crow Island.
He believes there is room for negotiation and hopes the towns can avoid court.
"If it can be proven these lands are in Harpswell we certainly don't want to give them up. If we did then we'd be rolling over and we would not be representing our constituency," he added.
However, Donald Gerrish, Brunswick's Town Manager had this to say about Wednesday's meeting.
"Our position hasn't changed. The line is where it has been for the last 40 to 50 years," Gerrish said. "I'm only there to listen."
Any change in the boundary would first have to be agreed to by governing bodies in both towns. The state Legislature would have the ultimate authority to change the boundary.
"We're going to ask them to draw their line in the sand and we'll draw ours. If they disagree then it will go to court." Robert Webber of Harpswell

Abstract: For the first time in 10 years, the 114-acre Mackworth Island clam flat may open to recreational clamming this fall. But recent surveying by the Friends of Casco Bay show the flat is ready to be opened. The group has submitted its studies to the state Department of Marine Resources. The department is expected to decide on the opening by the end of the summer. In the meantime, Friends of Casco Bay is studying whether the flat is a good spot for clams to call home. The group planted 6,000 tiny seed clams in the flat three weeks ago, and plans to harvest them in October to determine how they fared.

Full text: For the first time in 10 years, the 114-acre Mackworth Island clam flat may open to recreational clamming this fall.
Town officials are so confident the state will open the flat that they have allocated $12,325 in the proposed municipal budget for a shellfish warden.
Since 1986, high levels of water pollution have either kept the flat closed or severely limited the type of clamming that could take place there.
But recent surveying by the Friends of Casco Bay show the flat is ready to be opened. The group has submitted its studies to the state Department of Marine Resources. The department is expected to decide on the opening by the end of the summer.
In the meantime, Friends of Casco Bay is studying whether the flat is a good spot for clams to call home. The group planted 6,000 tiny seed clams in the flat three weeks ago, and plans to harvest them in October to determine how they fared.

Full text: The day that an airplane sprayed islands of Casco Bay with an insect poison, caterpillars were dying of bacterial infections in a laboratory 240 miles away.
The sacrificial insects, larvae of the browntail moth, had come from trees on Peaks Island weeks earlier. Their fate was to help researchers devise a safer, more environmentally mild manner of killing moths of their ilk, rather than use controversial chemical pesticides.
"From what we see now, it's very encouraging," said Normand Dubois, a U.S. Forest Service microbiologist leading the project at the Northeastern Center for Forest Health.
Dubois tapped a plastic box in which most of the caterpillars had, within five days, turned to corpses. "That one looks pretty good," he said.
Those sorts of words give heart to Mainers who are uneasy about chemical spraying. Dimilin, the pesticide sprayed last week over five infested islands and in Falmouth Foreside on the mainland, is controversial because it may harm lobsters and other shellfish.
The pesticide acts by blocking the formation of chitin, a tough substance that gives the bodies of caterpillars their structure. Chitin is also the stuff of which lobster and crab shells are made.
Dubois' goal is to find a form of bacteria that will kill moth larvae without threatening aquatic creatures or people, or damaging the environment.
"The sooner the better," said Jay Krouse, Maine Department of Marine Resources' chief lobster biologist. "I certainly would feel more comfortable if we did not have to use Dimilin again."
State marine resources officials last fall questioned using Dimilin because of its potential harm to lobsters. They ultimately supported the spray program because browntail moth caterpillars make people sick.
Allergic reactions to hairs
Contact with the caterpillars' hairs can cause severe rashes; inhaling the hairs can cause breathing problems. Scores of Casco Bay islanders and island visitors last year had allergic reactions to the caterpillar hairs, which waft around in the air.
The latest generation of caterpillars began emerging from webs early this month. Brown with a tawny fringe of prickly hairs, the larvae feed energetically on leaves and have the potential to strip acres of vegetation. Before becoming moths this summer, they will grow to 1 1/2 inches long and show two broken white lines on their backs.
During spraying last week, officials tried to keep Dimilin out of the ocean by avoiding areas within 100 feet of shore. Krouse said test cards set around the shoreline showed virtually no residue, meaning the chemical did not stray far from its target.
If all goes as hoped, Dubois will find a potent bacterial agent soon. His goal is to start field tests in Maine in mid-June, before the caterpillars disappear into cocoons. He's also experimenting with fungi that may be deadly to the caterpillars.
Dubois, a Maine native who grew up in Lewiston, has been working for 30 years with an established bacterial insecticide called Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt. Dubois said there are 40,000 strains of Bt, some better than others against specific insects.
Identifying which strain or strains will do the trick against browntail moth larvae is painstaking work. It requires hundreds of tests and repeat tests, an understanding of caterpillar behavior and tastes, and a knowledge of the physics of spraying liquids on trees.
Most of Dubois' work has been in fighting gypsy moth caterpillars. On the surface, they seem closely related to browntail moth caterpillars. Both explode in number, eat vigorously and turn forests brown.
But after spending a season with browntail moth caterpillars last year, Dubois found they are not like the gypsy moths he knows so well.
It turns out, for example, that browntail moths are sensitive to being disturbed, much more so than their gypsy cousins. When browntail caterpillars that emerged from their webs were hustled by impatient researchers onto treated oak saplings, the creatures rebelled.
"They would not eat at all," Dubois said. So stubborn were the caterpillars that they died from starvation rather than feed.
Webs from Peaks Island
Dubois got a fresh batch of 400 Peaks Island webs this year and started over. He had one more thing to learn about how to make browntail moth caterpillars happy - how many to keep in one cage.
The silken webs in which caterpillars live during the winter generally harbor 200 to 300 insects. Put that many live into a research container - a plastic case the size of a shoebox - and they'll eat each other.
Now, Dubois thins the colonies to about 50 per box. The culling is tedious work. Using tweezers, Dubois' research technicians, DeAdra Newman and Pamela Huntley, pick out bugs one at a time and discard them in jars of alcohol.
The remaining caterpillars are left to eat oak saplings, which they do with great delicacy. Rather than chomp leaves whole, browntail moth larvae nibble only the greenest part, avoiding the veins. What's left is a leaf skeleton that resembles lace.
Their discriminating tastes mean browntail moth larvae are that much harder to poison. They potentially can eat around drops of Bt on leaves or simply stop feeding until the bacterial agent breaks down - which it does quickly when exposed to sunlight or rain.
The physics of spraying is a complicated matter. For instance, electrostatic forces around leaves can repel drops of pesticide. "If the drop is so fine that its mass can't overcome the electric field, it will curve away," Dubois said.
To test ways of best delivering the spray, the researchers simulate aerial spraying in a handmade 12-foot tower. One afternoon last week, Huntley shook up a flask of Bt, which looked like cafe au lait. Below, four saplings rotated on little platforms, a movement that is supposed to simulate wind eddies around branches.
Huntley poured a touch of liquid into a special nozzle, then sprayed. The enclosure at the top of the tower filled with a peculiar smell. "Like dog feet" is how Richard Bradbury, a Maine Forest Service entomologist, describes the scent of Bt.
Manufacturers prepare the bacterial killer in large fermentation vats. Dubois said the germs are inactive until they reach the gut of a caterpillar, which is alkaline - unlike human and lobster stomachs, which are acidic. Triggered by the alkalinity, an agent in the Bt formula ruptures the caterpillar's stomach lining, enabling the bacteria to invade and infect the bloodstream.
Dubois said Bt is found naturally in soils, but not in sufficient quantity to kill an epidemic of caterpillars.
Bt has been around for decades. It was first registered as a pesticide in 1954. In fact, Maine used Bt on Little Diamond Island in 1991 and 1992 in the early years of the latest browntail moth outbreak. That treatment was not very effective, so the forest service began recommending Dimilin, which is considered harmless to humans and other mammals, birds and fish.
First outbreak in 1897
More dangerous poisons were used against the browntail moth caterpillar during earlier infestations.
The very first outbreak began in Massachusetts in 1897, some time after browntail moths arrived in this country in a shipment of roses from Europe.
The weapon against that first infestation was lead arsenate. "So well did poison adhere that caterpillars died as fast as hatched," said one report from the time.
Another infestation hit Maine in the 1940s, prompting aerial spraying of DDT, a notoriously potent and persistent pesticide now banned from use.
The latest epidemic, which started in 1989, has spread from the islands to the mainland. Bradbury, the Maine Forest Service insect expert, found moth webs this winter from Kittery to Port Clyde. He said Bailey Island is especially infested.
He predicted that demand for additional pesticide treatments will rise as more people are made uncomfortable by the caterpillar this spring. "Everyone's an environmentalist until they start scratching," Bradbury said.
The spreading infestation lends urgency to Dubois' experiments. He is not, however, ready to announce success. "It looks very promising," he said, "but we're not there yet."

Abstract: After this summer, planes taxiing for takeoff from Wiscasset Municipal Airport will no longer come into such close contact with planes that are trying to land. There is no control tower at the airport. Takeoffs and landings are done visually. Townspeople by an overwhelming margin approved a deal Tuesday night that will pay $10,000 to the owners of a campground at the end of the runway. The money will buy the town the right to place a 65-foot pole with a warning light amid campers, satisfying a Federal Aviation Administration safety requirement. The FAA will now release $871,803 to the town to pay for a new taxiway parallel to the 3,400-foot runway. Rather than starting in the middle of the runway, the new taxiway will allow pilots who are trying to take off ample space to stop or get out of the way of incoming planes.

Full text: Philip Simpson, a local pilot, said he watched in horror recently as an airplane flying just 25 feet above his cockpit landed on the runway he had just taxied down.
"It's scary, because you don't have any place that you can go," Simpson said. "It is a little unnerving, and I'm not the only one. It has happened to other pilots."
After this summer, planes taxiing for takeoff from Wiscasset Municipal Airport will no longer come into such close contact with planes that are trying to land. There is no control tower at the airport. Takeoffs and landings are done visually.
Townspeople by an overwhelming margin approved a deal Tuesday night that will pay $10,000 to the owners of a campground at the end of the runway. The money will buy the town the right to place a 65-foot pole with a warning light amid campers, satisfying a Federal Aviation Administration safety requirement.
The FAA will now release $871,803 to the town to pay for a new taxiway parallel to the 3,400-foot runway. Rather than starting in the middle of the runway, the new taxiway will allow pilots who are trying to take off ample space to stop or get out of the way of incoming planes.
Of the roughly 25 residents who attended Tuesday's special town meeting, only one person opposed the deal. Ross Varney questioned the need to pay $10,000 to the campground owners.
Initially, the campground's owners were opposed to having the warning light placed on their property. But the town's selectmen were able to negotiate an agreement.
The project will also include demolition of an old terminal building, construction of an apron for parked planes, and repaving areas that are cracked.
Airport supporters hope the improvements, which will cost more than $1 million, will turn the municipally owned airport - the only coastal airport between Portland and Rockland - into a gateway to Lincoln County and Down East Maine.
David Kinney, the town's engineer, said the project should begin next month. The state Department of Transportation and the town will each be required to contribute $48,434 to the project.
Chewonki Campground will also benefit. Although the warning light will be inside the campground at the end of the runway, it will be above the tree line and barely visible to campers. It will also steer pilots away from the campground's wooded area.
In an unrelated matter, town selectmen Tuesday night said they intend to terminate a reciprocal clam-digging agreement with the town of Woolwich because of a lack of interest among Woolwich diggers.
Tim James, chairman of the Wiscasset Shellfish Committee, said a regional diggers' meeting May 1 was not attended by any Woolwich diggers. The two towns had hoped to share manpower to reseed clam flats and do conservation work. Under the agreement, diggers from one town may dig clams in the other town.
"We haven't made any progress with them," James said. "We'd like to move on." "It's scary, because you don't have any place that you can go." Philip Simpson, a pilot, explaining why the taxiway is needed

Abstract: A professional crop-duster will fly just above the treetops over parts of Peaks, Great Diamond and Cushing islands in the city of Portland. Later, possibly on another day, the pilot will spray private properties on Clapboard and Sturdivant islands, and a section of Falmouth Foreside on the mainland. The plane will deliver a mist of water mixed with Dimilin, a pesticide that gradually kills the caterpillars by stopping production of chitin, a tough substance that protects the caterpillars' heads. The state supports Dimilin spraying to reduce the chances of humans coming in contact with the caterpillars' poisonous hairs. The hairs can cause nasty rashes, similar to poison ivy, or respiratory problems when inhaled. The hairs float in the air whenever the caterpillars shed their skin, which they do five times before becoming moths.

Full text: Aerial spraying to combat the pesky browntail moth caterpillar will begin on some Casco Bay islands at dawn Monday, weather permitting.
A professional crop-duster will fly just above the treetops over parts of Peaks, Great Diamond and Cushing islands in the city of Portland. Later, possibly on another day, the pilot will spray private properties on Clapboard and Sturdivant islands, and a section of Falmouth Foreside on the mainland.
The plane will deliver a mist of water mixed with Dimilin, a pesticide that gradually kills the caterpillars by stopping production of chitin, a tough substance that protects the caterpillars' heads.
Dimilin is considered relatively safe for humans and other mammals because they don't have chitin. However, because the chemical has been in use for less than 20 years, little is known about the effects of long-term, chronic exposure.
Other types of insects, as well as crustaceans such as lobsters and crabs, do have chitin and might be vulnerable to Dimilin as a result - something that concerns lobstermen.
The state supports Dimilin spraying to reduce the chances of humans coming in contact with the caterpillars' poisonous hairs. The hairs can cause nasty rashes, similar to poison ivy, or respiratory problems when inhaled. The hairs float in the air whenever the caterpillars shed their skin, which they do five times before becoming moths.
"We were isolated two months in our homes last year because of it," said Claire Filliettaz, a Peaks Island resident who led a petition drive supporting pesticide treatment.
Jeff Tarling, Portland's arborist, said the city received reports last summer of hundreds of islanders and island visitors sickened by the caterpillars.
Richard Bradbury, a Maine Forest Service entomologist, said the goal is not to eradicate the pests but to reduce their numbers in residential neighborhoods.
"I'll consider it a success if the incidence of rashes is just reduced," Bradbury said.
The timing of the spraying is hard to plan. The task requires clear, dry weather and winds below 8 mph. Mike Lavoie, the crop-duster hired to do the job, said optimum times tend to be early morning and early evening. But, he added, "If it was nice in the middle of the day, we could do it then, too."
City officials said about 25 acres of Peaks will be sprayed, 80 acres on Cushing and 240 acres on Great Diamond.
Lavoie said treating Peaks will take perhaps 20 minutes; Cushing and Great Diamond, about an hour each.
Later, most likely on another day, Lavoie said, he will spray Sturdivant and Clapboard islands and Falmouth Foreside areas - about 120 acres altogether.
To reduce the risk of Dimilin getting into thebay, spraying is barred within 100 feet of the shoreline. If possible, spraying will be done during high tide, to dilute any wafting chemical.
To monitor the effects of Dimilin on lobsters, state biologists have placed 48 caged lobsters near the shores of four target islands. Another 12 lobsters are set elsewhere in the bay as a control group.
Jay Krouse, the state's chief lobster biologist, said the creatures will be kept at the state Department of Marine Resources laboratory in Boothbay Harbor this summer and watched for changes in behavior or health.
If the lobsters are exposed to the pesticide, they will not form new shells, which is how they grow.
"If I thought there was any likelihood of this to happen, I would not have supported the spraying program," Krouse said. "I think it very, very unlikely, considering the dilution effect."
Designing the $7,500 caterpillar attack was a laborious task for the city of Portland. State law requires permission from every property owner and resident of the area to be treated, as well as those on the outskirts.
For Peaks Island, the most populous in the bay, the city mailed 800 postcards notifying the potentially affected people, and called property owners who live across the country.
The city had sought permission to spray the western half of the island. But 52 property owners or residents, scattered through much the target region, objected.
Consequently, the city will spray only the southwest corner, known as Torrington Point, home to roughly 60 households.
This is the third year that land in Casco Bay will be aerially sprayed with Dimilin. Bradbury, the state entomologist, said Little Diamond Island, which is sparsely populated, was first treated with the chemical in 1994. Last year, Little and Great Diamond islands were sprayed.
The caterpillar population continues to spread along the coast. Bradbury said browntail moth webs have been found from Kittery to Port Clyde, with the heaviest con centrations in Greater Portland. Thelatest infestation began about 1990 on the islands of Casco Bay, which remain the hardest hit.
Bradbury said he is hopeful that if pesticide treatment is warranted again next year, something other than Dimilin will be available. U.S. Forest Service researchers in Connecticut are searching now for a bacteria or fungus that's a natural predator of the caterpillar. QUESTIONS?

Illustration GRAPHIC: Combatting the Browntail Moth The Browntail Season MAP: Browntail infestation Areas to be sprayed; Caption: Staff art by Paul Kolsti Sources: Jeff Tarling, Portland city arborist; M.S. Lavoie, air applicator, Richard Bradbury, state forestry department Combating the Browntail Moth The Portland forestry department plans an aerial attack to stem the exploding population of browntail moths infesting the islands of Casco Bay. Parts of Great Diamond, Peaks and Cushing will be sprayed - possibly as soon as Monday morning, weather permitting. Private landowners also have made arrangements to aerially spray a portion of the Portland Country Club and Clapboard Island in Falmouth, and Sturdivant Island (Cumberland). Why spray now? Conditions are just right: Young leaves are big enough to catch and hold the spray, but small enough to allow it to penetrate to lower branches. The browntail, now in its caterpillar (larval) stage, is dining on the leaves of oak, apple, poplar, cherry, hawthorn, serviceberry, rugosa rose and bayberry. Once the caterpillar ingests the spray it cannot molt (shed its skin), and it dies. Is the spray dangerous? The spray is a mixture of water and the pesticide Dimilin. It is considered harmless to birds, fish, pets and humans. However, as a precaution, island residents are advised to stay indoors with windows closed during spraying. Molting shellfish such as lobsters and crabs could be affected, so no spraying will be done within 100 feet of wetlands of the shoreline. How does the pilot direct the spray? The direction and number of "passes" that will be needed to cover infested areas is determined in advance. The pilot then waits for the right weather - ideally a clear sky with a light wind of 3 to 5 mph. (If Monday's weather proves unsuitable, the spraying could be done any weekday through May 24.) Using landmarks such as piers, roads and ridges as guides, he flies 25 to 50 feet above the trees at a speed of 105 mph, leaving a 75-foot-wide swath of spray on each pass. The Browntail Season 1. Early May: As temperatures warm to the 60s and 70s, tiny browntail larvae emerge from their winter webs. 2. May to late June: As they feed on the leaves of trees and shrubs, the caterpillars grow quickly, shedding their skin three times as they reach a mature size of 1 1/2 inches. On windy days, their tiny hairs can become airborne and land on people, causing a severe, itchy rash that persists for days. 3. Late June: Caterpillars form cocoons and pupate. During this three-week stage, the caterpillars turn into moths. 4. Early to mid-July: Moths emerge and mate. Females lay 150 to 400 eggs each. 5. Mid- to late August: Another generationof browntails is born. The larvae feed again on foliage, molt once and construct the nests where they will winter from October through April. Browntail infestation Browntails have been seen as far south as Kittery and as far north as Port Clyde, but the infestation worst in and around Casco Bay.

Full text:   Becky MacDonald grunted and puffed as she stooped over a mud flat on Jones Creek, clawing over the heavy muck with a clam hoe.
As MacDonald, a 24-year-old Americorps member from Portland, dug her way along the flat, Ron Willette offered advice rooted in years of experience.
"Don't beat yourself to death, or you'll be all pooped," said Willette, a commercial clam digger. "It's just like digging a garden."
On Tuesday, National Youth Service Day, MacDonald and five other Americorps members from Portland raked the mud and dropped thousands of seed clams, a sowing of sorts that should yield a bountiful harvest of clams some day.
Their labors were part of a statewide community service project aimed at boosting marine life. Called "Seeding for Our Future," the program will survey, seed and clean up clam flats at three sites in Cumberland, Lincoln and Washington counties.
Organizers said the project is intended to support the shellfishing industry, promote an understanding of coastal resources and give Americorps members a chance to show their community spirit.
That fits the mission of Americorps nationwide. Created by the Clinton administration, Americorps is a national service program comprising several thousand members - including 20 in Greater Portland - that strives to make young adults feel part of their communities and country.
"These people are very idealistic and community-minded," said Betty Farley, manager at the Cumberland County Soil and Water Conservation District, who helped to oversee the project. "They recognize they can't change the world, but they want to take a small corner of it and make a difference."
In Scarborough, making a difference meant laboring for about two hours in damp, foggy weather on Jones Creek, a conservation area where digging for clams is allowed only about two weeks out of the year.
While part of the Americorps crew dug up and raked the creek flats, others dug seed clams from nearby Winnock's Neck, where clamming has not been allowed for years because of bacterial pollution from sewage.
The transplanted clams will cleanse themselves naturally after about two months in their new location. When they mature, they should help to bolster the productivity of Scarborough's flats.
That's important to diggers like Willette, who are worried that the clam population may not be able to sustain itself.
"We've had three real good years of digging," he said. "I'm afraid the next one might not be so good."
MacDonald, one of the Americorps members, said she appreciated the chance to work on the clam-seeding project.
It was a change of pace from her regular assignment - working with youthful offenders in a restitution and counseling program operated by the Portland West Neighborhood Planning Council.
MacDonald, 24, gets a small stipend for her work, credit toward her college loans and a chance to help the community while she ponders her future.
"I never thought I'd be doing anything like this - or working with at-risk youth," she said. "But it's been really great."
Other Americorps members, together with community volunteers and conservationists, also worked at Mill Cove in South Portland on Tuesday.
They cleaned up the beach, sorted and recycled trash and conducted an insect analysis to learn about water quality in the cove.

Abstract: Moon snails and green crabs." Maryalice Crofton, acting director of the Maine Commission for Community Service, laughs as she chants the words. In celebration of National Youth Service Day, several hundred people will help restore clam flats or clean up beaches in Cobscook, Penobscot and Casco bays. They'll also be learning about water quality, watersheds, clams, and Seuss-sounding predators such as moon snails and green crabs.

Full text: Moon snails and green crabs." Maryalice Crofton, acting director of the Maine Commission for Community Service, laughs as she chants the words.
"I can't help but think of Dr. Seuss," she admits.
Actually, Tuesday's blend of fun and education would fit in nicely with the philosophyof cooperation taught to generations of children by the good doctor's books.
In celebration of National Youth Service Day, several hundred people will help restore clam flats or clean up beaches in Cobscook, Penobscot and Casco bays. They'll also be learning about water quality, watersheds, clams, and Seuss-sounding predators such as moon snails and green crabs.
For the one-day project, the community service commission, a state agency, has pulled together service groups such as AmeriCorps, SeniorCorps and Learn to Service America (for children from kindergarten through high school).
In southern Maine, other groups also will join in, from businesses like Tom's of Maine and Atlantic Bank, to students from Lyman Moore Middle School in Portland.
Six AmeriCorps members, in cooperation with the Scarborough Shellfish Committee, will spend Tuesday morning preparing a site at the Jones Creek conservation area and then transplant seed clams from Winnock Neck. In about two years, the restored clam flatsare expected to open for harvesting.
"It's not just a nice project," Crofton says, "but something that will contribute to the economic health of the community."
At the same time, other workers will clean up the beach at Mill Cove in South Portland.
The second phase of the project, set at Mill Creek Park, will be devoted to education. The idea is not only to do good deeds, but to understand why they're so important.
Nor will the learning stop at the end of the day. AmeriCorps members also will prepare a package of information about the process for local schools.
The lessons of this day are well worth learning. Environmental pollution can be reversed. People and organizations can work together to effect positive change.
Finally, it's always a pleasure to discover that learning can be fun.
Dr. Seuss would be proud.

Abstract: Any day now, work on a portion of the $43 million Brunswick/Topsham bypass will come to a halt so that a weird, prehistoric looking fish can bear its young in peace. The fish is the shortnosed sturgeon, a brownish, bottom-dwelling creature that is usually about three feet long, can live up to 60 years, and is listed by the federal government as an endangered species. The 1,080-foot bypass bridge crosses the Androscoggin River about a half-mile below one of the shortnosed sturgeon's favorite spawning grounds. Scott Rollins, environmental permit supervisor for the Maine Department of Transportation, said the work stoppage will not delay the bypass project.

Any day now, work on a portion of the $43 million Brunswick/Topsham bypass will come to a halt so that a weird, prehistoric looking fish can bear its young in peace.
The fish is the shortnosed sturgeon, a brownish, bottom-dwelling creature that is usually about three feet long, can live up to 60 years, and is listed by the federal government as an endangered species.
The 1,080-foot bypass bridge crosses the Androscoggin River about a half-mile below one of the shortnosed sturgeon's favorite spawning grounds. Scott Rollins, environmental permit supervisor for the Maine Department of Transportation, said the work stoppage will not delay the bypass project.
He said it will probably lasta few weeks, enough time for adult fish to bear their young and for both adults and offspring to swim back down river to Merrymeeting Bay.
"It appears this will work out without harming the fish or the project," Rollins said.
The work stoppage was ordered by the National Marine Fisheries Service. It will only affect bridge work that is done in the water. Work on piers above the water can continue.
The stoppage begins when the water temperature hits 46 degrees Fahrenheit. That's when the sturgeon start migrating to their spawning ground. The water is currently 40 degrees. It is expected to heat up in the next week or two.
The stoppage ends on the Brunswick side of the bridge site on June 15 and on the Topsham side on July 15. The Topsham side is deeper and a more likely route for the fish to travel.
About 8,500 shortnosed sturgeon inhabit the Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers, making it one of the most densely populated areas along the Eastern Seaboard.
Thomas Squires, a state marine resources scientist, has studied the sturgeon's habits extensively to ensure the fish will not be harmed by the project. In 1993 he led a project that placed radio transmitters on some sturgeon to track their location. He found that they often spawn just below the Central Maine Power hydroelectric dam between Brunswick and Topsham.
That study also examined whether sturgeon visit the construction area during the winter. Scientists drilled a hole in the ice near the bridge site and inserted a three-foot long robotic vehicle that drove along the river bottom with a video camera. No sturgeons were spotted. If they had been, the work stoppage might have been much longer.
Squire said the presence of the shortnosed sturgeon in the area was not known until they were discovered in the 1970s during studies of Montsweag Bay that were looking at what impact construction of the Maine Yankee nuclear plant would have on the area.
He said previously they were probably mistaken for a better known relative, the Atlantic sturgeon, which can grow to up to eight feet long and 300 pounds.
All the attention the shortnosed sturgeon has been getting might not be for its own good.
"We've found that there are many more of them than was thought when they were listed as endangered," Squires said. "There's a chance they will be taken off the list." ABOUT THE SHORTNOSE STURGEON
Size: Rarely exceeds 3 feet in length; generally weighs 5-6 pounds
Age: Matures about age 14; can live to be 40 years old
Range: Mostly in river mouths, tidal rivers, estuaries and bays from New Brunswick to Florida
Population: 7,000 to 10,000 adults in the Kennebec-Androscoggin rivers, the largest population in New England and one of the largest on the Eastern Seaboard
Notes: Shortnose sturgeons are bottom feeders, using whisker-like barbels to find worms and mollusks. They are not commercially valuable

FREEPORT CLOSES LOOPHOLE ON CLAM POACHERS THE TOWN COUNCIL ALSO INCREASES LICENSE FEES FOR COMMERCIAL DIGGERS.

Abstract: The Town Council closed a loophole on clam poachers Tuesday night, voting unanimously to tighten restrictions on recreational clam licenses. Under the changes, anyone who carries a state commercial clam license will be unable to get a recreational license from the town. If someone gets a commercial license after buying a town recreational license, the town license will be voided. The new rules take effect May 15. Freeport's commercial licenses cost $125 to $175 and allow unlimited clam digging. The number of commercial licenses issued each year is determined by measuring how many clams are growing in the town's mud flats. Recreational licenses cost $10 and allow a person to dig up to one peck of clams a day. Any resident can get a recreational license.

Full text:   The Town Council closed a loophole on clam poachers Tuesday night, voting unanimously to tighten restrictions on recreational clam licenses.
Under the changes, anyone who carries a state commercial clam license will be unable to get a recreational license from the town. If someone gets a commercial license after buying a town recreational license, the town license will be voided. The new rules take effect May 15.
The changes are designed to reduce poaching and protect the shellfish, Town Manager Dale Olmstead said. "Otherwise, the resource dwindles."
Freeport, like many other coastal communities in Maine, seeds its mud flats with baby clams and limits the number of commercial digging licenses to protect clam populations. But poachers have used the loophole in state and local licensing to circumvent those restrictions.
Freeport's commercial licenses cost $125 to $175 and allow unlimited clam digging. The number of commercial licenses issued each year is determined by measuring how many clams are growing in the town's mud flats. Recreational licenses cost $10 and allow a person to dig up to one peck of clams a day. Any resident can get a recreational license.
Some people who couldn't obtain a commercial license from the town would buy a recreational license and dig more than the peck-per-day limit. They would then sell the clams by showing a state commercial license, which allows clammers to sell their catch and is the only identification state law requires.
"Over the last couple of years, there have been a number of arrests," Olmstead said. "Recreational-license guys would dig next to a friend with a commercial license and drop their clams into his sack."
Another change the Town Council approved, on a 5-2 vote, will increase the cost of commercial licenses next year.
Commercial license fees will increase to $200 from $125 for Freeport residents. Non-residents, who paid $175 this year for a commercial license, will have to pay $400 in 1997.
Those fees will take effect next March 1, when licenses will come up for renewal.
Councilor Genie Beaulieu said the fees will allow Freeport's Shellfish Commission to operate with less financial support from taxpayers. "There haven't been any increases in these licenses in 10 years," she said.
Councilors Kenneth Mann and Alan Hindley opposed the fee increase, saying the increase is too high for a single year. Mann recommended phasing in the increase over two years.
"Over the last couple of years, there have been a number of arrests." Dale Olmstead, town manager

Full text: Whelks, meat-eating sea snails favored mostly by foreign gastronomes, may become Maine's next commercial fishing craze.
But even as the demand for Gulf of Maine whelks increases, seafood dealers and regulators are trying to prevent a boom. For the first time, they are talking ahead of time about how to prevent overfishing a sea creature in a promising new market.
Despite the talk, fishermen probably will catch thousands of the marine snails before any controls are applied. At least two independent companies have plans to fish, process and ship overseas whelks by the ton.
One of the businesses, based in Portland, is ready to set 200 traps in the water this week.
"As usual, the state can't act fast enough to deal with these issues," said Maine Marine Resources Commissioner Robin Alden. "Our capacity to respond to new fisheries is astoundingly low."
Regulators and fishermen fear the whelk fishery will follow the pattern of Maine's multimillion-dollar urchin and elver industries.
In those cases, people lured by the smell of money jumped in before state scientists could determine how many of the animals could be killed without depressing the populations.
Judging from landings, urchin stock began to decline in 1994. The elver fishery, entering its third season, has not yet peaked.
Now the state is trying to get in front of the boom. The Department of Marine Resources is drafting plans for controlling all such new fisheries in the future.
Whether its work will be done in time for the whelk is questionable.
Whelks are meat-eating snails with shells that spiral to a pointy end. At least six types of whelk slide around the Gulf of Maine, in waters both shallow and deep.
The sea snails are eaten in Europe and Asia. They are not popular in America, although pickled whelks - blanched, then marinated in vinegar - are a delicacy in some coastal communities of Maine. Generally speaking, people eat the foot - the slab of flesh upon which the whelk glides.
Whelks have had a small market in Maine for years. They are sold for 20 to 30 cents a pound by lobstermen, who frequently find the creatures rattling around in their lobster traps. The whelks are attracted to the traps by fish bait.
Their shells, which fit in the palm of a hand, also are sought by craftspeople. A business in Raymond called Designs by Diana uses 5,000 to 10,000 whelk shells a year to make decorative wreaths.
In 1992, Maine lobstermen sold nearly 16,000 pounds of whelks, valued at just over $3,500.
How much money is at stake in an expanded whelk fishery isn't clear. Two prospective processors - Lavida Co. of Portland and the owner of Aquaculture Resource Development of Madbury, N.H. - say they would handle 10 to 20 tons a day. They will not discuss price per pound.
Buyer found in Korea
The men behind Lavida Co. are Michael Carrier and Curt Ludwig, who most recently made a living diving for urchins. The partners said last week that they have a deal to supply whelk meat to a buyer in Korea.
Working at Custom House Wharf, the men said they intend to process 20 metric tons of whelks, or more, each day.
Carrier said he hopes to distribute 200 traps to 20 fishermen this week. Common whelk traps are small buckets set with bait. The mollusks fall into the traps but can't climb out.
Beyond offering an outline of their plans, Carrier and Ludwig were wary of giving details of their operation until after it's established, in the next several weeks.
"I don't want it to be overfished," Carrier said. "It'd be like a gold rush."
That term - "gold rush" - is often linked to Maine's urchin industry.
The urchin fishery took off in 1988, spurred by demand from Japan, where people love the urchin roe. Little was known about urchin life span, growth rates and mating habits. Only last year did Maine begin a special research program for urchins - one year after landings began to decline.
The urchin market remains valuable, though - Maine fishermen made $33.2 million on urchins in1995.
Another Maine fishery described as a gold rush is the elver industry. Stimulated by demand from Asian eel farmers wanting seed stock, Mainers began fishing for elvers with gusto in 1994.
The industry was worth $3.8 million to the state last year and continues in a heated fashion this year. This year, 2,195 people are licensed to catch elvers - nearly double last year's number.
An emergency law passed last month restricts the number of traps per elver harvester and prohibits fishing one day a week. But the measures do not guarantee that the elver harvest will be sustainable because no one knows what that would entail.
Experimental proposal
Mindful of the potential for another boom-bust scenario with whelks, one would-be processor asked the state last fall to set up a highly controlled experimental fishery - and to give him exclusive rights to it for two years.
Ian Walker, owner of the New Hampshire company Aquaculture Resource Development, said that to fish under unregulated conditions doesn't make sense economically or environmentally.
"We're talking about making a significant investment in Maine to set up a proper processing plant," Walker said. "If we're going to make that commitment, and it's going to be destroyed in a very short period of time, it's not worth the commitment."
Walker said his venture, to be run jointly with a businessman in Scotland, would pay a scientist who would answer to the state in studying the whelk. Fishermen under contract to Walker's company would be obligated to report their landings to the state, under his plan.
He also proposes to fish whelks in a given area until the catch drops by half, then to close the area. The following year, fishermen would return to the area to determine how much the whelk stock had replenished.
The third year, after a sustainable harvest rate is determined at least roughly, the fishery would open to all.
At Lavida Co., Carrier bristled at the notion of an exclusive fishery. He said he supports conservation measures such as closing fishing areas during whelk mating season but that everyone should have an equal chance to fish.
Marine Resources Commissioner Alden said her department does not have the right, nor does she have the inclination, to offer exclusive harvesting rights to a single operator.
However, Walker's proposal did spur Marine Resources staff to look immediately at the fishery.
Maine Marine Patrol Lt. Dan Morris predicted that the whelk team would recommend emergency regulations that could be in place within a month.
Starting from scratch
But in gathering information, they're working from scratch. Peter Thayer, a state marine biologist, said that when he searched scientific literature for information, the only references to the whelk species in question were from other countries.
Differences in water temperature and other variations in habitat make it dangerous to assume that what's true for a whelk in Canada, for instance, would apply to a Maine whelk, he said.
Complicating matters is the fact that some whelk species are toxic to humans. Others are toxic during periods of "red tide," which occurs when an algae poisonous to humans proliferates.
Because of the red tide danger, Maine in 1992 closed the whelk fishery altogether. At the request of fishermen, the state tested whelk samples recently and found them to be clean.
As a result, waters off Jonesport were reopened in November. An area from Georgetown to Biddeford, including Casco and Saco bays, opened in February.
For the moment, the only state requirement of someone harvesting whelks is to have a general commercial fishing license, which costs $33. The only thing to prevent overfishing is voluntary restraint by the industry itself.
Walker said his operation would have the capacity to process 20 tons of whelks, including the shell, each day, though he would expect to handle only half that many.
By his estimate, there are three or four whelks to a pound. That means he'd process 60,000 to 80,000 snails a day.
Walker said surveys he's done of Maine waters suggest that the population would support his operation.
Morris isn't so sure. "Sounds like a lot of animals to me," he said. "At that rate, how many months can you go?"
Walker, whose eclectic background includes commercial groundfishing on draggers, studying art, setting up oyster farms and growing Christmas trees, said he has no interest in destroying a fishery.
Walker said he envisions setting up a whelk processing plant in Portland by late June, but that if the state doesn't have a management plan, he'll look elsewhere. Given that his partner is in Scotland, he said, the plant could be built there.
Regardless of whether his business is established in Maine, his query has prompted the state to try to develop a standard for experimental fisheries that would apply whenever someone proposes to exploit a new species.
Walker said that if Maine succeeds in regulating a new fishery before it goes sour, it would set an example for the world. "As usual, the state can't act fast enough to deal with these issues. Our capacity to respond to new fisheries is astoundingly low." Robin Alden, commissioner, Marine Resources

Stored together in captivity, they'll eventually eat each other. At least six types of whelks live in the Gulf of Maine: waved whelk (pictured above); dog winkle; mud dog whelk; 10-ridged whelk; Stimpson's whelk; and channeled whelk. The waved whelk, or Buccinum undatum, is the prime target of the fledgling Maine fishery. Research in Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence shows that the males reach sexual maturity in five or six years; females, in seven years. In warmer Gulf of Maine waters, the snails may mature more quickly. Unlike fish, whelks reproduce by copulating. The females lay fertilized eggs in masses, which, in Canadian waters, produce about 3,700 offspring. Egg masses usually are found attached to rocks or kelp. The masses are known as fishermen's soap, because of their frothy, sudsy look. p.14A

Full text: Clam diggers from Wiscasset and Woolwich put aside their differences and agreed Wednesday night to form a regional shellfish advisory commission.
The six-member commission, including three members from each town, would develop a regional management plan for preserving clam flats along the Sheepscot, Back and Sasanoa rivers. It would oversee baby clam reseeding programs and foster communication between diggers.
Clam diggers also agreed to preserve a 3-year-old agreement that gives 11 commercial license holders from Wiscasset the right to harvest clams in Woolwich and vice versa.
An air of reconciliation pervaded Wednesday's meeting, which selectmen ordered clam diggers to hold to try to resolve their differences. Clam diggers from the neighboring towns quarreled a few weeks ago over the opening of four Wiscasset clam flats that had been closed for 20 years.
Wiscasset's clam diggers recommended those flats be closed until June, when commercial prices skyrocket. Woolwich diggers protested, saying a closure was not fair to diggers whose livelihoods depend on clam flats.
With nearly $500,000 in profits at stake, the towns' selectmen called in an environmental consultant to mediate the dispute Wednesday night.
Timothy James, chairman of the Wiscasset Shellfish Committee, introduced the proposal for the regional shellfish commission, which would include the code enforcement officer from each town, the chairman of each town's shellfish committee and a commercial clam digger from each town. His plan received no opposition.
"Let's give it a year," James said. "If they can't work it out by then, it's not going to happen."
The regional commission will begin work immediately on a regional shellfish ordinance, which would have to be adopted by both towns at their town meeting, James said.
Meanwhile, Wiscasset's clam diggers would be willing to train Woolwich diggers to take accurate water samples, James said. Those samples are tested by the state Department of Marine Resources to determine whether clam flats are polluted.
James said Wiscasset is also willing to share in the cost of a joint reseeding program.
Alan King, chairman of the Woolwich Shellfish Committee, said his town has been reluctant to provide financial assistance.
"We don't believe we should use taxpayer money to support this program," Woolwich Selectman Lloyd Coombs said. "It should be completely self-sufficient."
Roger Jones, spokesman for the newly formed Maine Marine Worm Diggers Association, argued that his group should be represented on the regional commission. Brunswick recently tried to close 200 acres of marine worm flats so it could reseed them with baby clams. The state temporarily overturned that decision.
"We're losing mud, and we're losing our rights," Jones said. "Will we be notified if Wiscasset closes its flats for reseeding?"
"We're with you, Roger," said Rex Collamore, a Wiscasset clam digger. "We have no intention of getting in the worm diggers' way." The regional commission will begin work immediately on a regional shellfish ordinance.

Abstract: Clam diggers from Woolwich and Wiscasset will meet tonight in an attempt to reach an agreement they hope will preserve scarce clam flats for future generations. Tonight's session was called after the state Department of Marine Resources in March granted permission for Wiscasset to open clam flats on the Sheepscot River that had been closed for nearly 20 years. Soon after the flats were reopened, the Wiscasset Shellfish Committee recommended they be closed until June, when commercial prices for a bushel of clams triples from the current $30 to as much as $90. The reopening by the state of Bailey's Cove, Young's Cove, Chewonki Creek Cove and Polly Clark Cove brought to light underlying tensions between the towns. Wiscasset diggers felt they had done all the conservation work needed to reopen the flats while Woolwich diggers had done very little. Oak Island is about the only productive clam flat in Woolwich.

Full text: Clam diggers from Woolwich and Wiscasset will meet tonight in an attempt to reach an agreement they hope will preserve scarce clam flats for future generations.
The unusual meeting between members of theWoolwich and Wiscasset Shellfish Committees is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. in the Wiscasset Municipal Building on Route 1.
Clam diggers hope they can patch up their differences and form a regional shellfish-management committee comprised of diggers and selectmen from both communities. One governing body would enforce laws, resolve disputes and manage flats better than two competing committees, diggers say.
Tonight's session was called after the state Department of Marine Resources in March granted permission for Wiscasset to open clam flats on the Sheepscot River that had been closed for nearly 20 years. Soon after the flats were reopened, the Wiscasset Shellfish Committee recommended they be closed until June, when commercial prices for a bushel of clams triples from the current $30 to as much as $90.
Woolwich's commercial clam diggers, who have the right to dig in Wiscasset under a reciprocal agreement, objected to the closure because many of their livelihoods depend on being able to dig year-round.
The reopening by the state of Bailey's Cove, Young's Cove, Chewonki Creek Cove and Polly Clark Cove brought to light underlying tensions between the towns. Wiscasset diggers felt they had done all the conservation work needed to reopen the flats while Woolwich diggers had done very little. Oak Island is about the only productive clam flat in Woolwich.
"Several conflicts need to be resolved before we go any further," said Wiscasset Selectman Robert Blagden, a former clam digger. "I feel the two towns can work out their differences."
Blagden and the other selectmen voted to allow digging in Bailey's Cove, Young's Cove and Chewonki Creek Cove on Thursdays only. They restricted digging at Polly Clark Cove to Fridays and Satur days. The hope is that both towns can work together to get more flats open and relieve pressure on the ones that are open.
Woolwich Selectman Lloyd Coombs would like to see the towns develop an agreement that would include: a regional shellfish management committee; regional clam wardens; and conservation requirements that are equal.
Under current rules, Wiscasset's clam diggers, before they can renew their commercial license, must perform 30 hours of conservation work a year. Woolwich diggers must perform 20 hours. Conservation work can involve reseeding of flats or shoreline surveys.
"It (the restrictions on digging) kind of limits you, but you've got to see it as saving the resource," Alan King, a Woolwich commercial clam digger, said.
King, chairman of the Woolwich Shellfish Committee, promises that Woolwich will begin to pull its weight. He and other diggers recently took water samples from Brooking's Bay, a huge clam flat in Woolwich that has been closed for years. Brooking's Bay will be open to digging by June, King predicts.
Water quality samples are tested at the state lab in Boothbay Harbor. The state relies on local diggers to take samples since it no longer has the staff.
King said his town's shellfish committee, which was completely overhauled, is less than a year old. King said the committee has not been funded by the town since 1990 and is struggling to catch up with Wiscasset's shellfish committee, which has been very active and well financed.
"Woolwich has a lot to learn. Wiscasset has a lot to offer," King said.
"It (the restrictions on digging) kind of limits you, but you've got to see it as saving the resource." Alan King, a Woolwich commercial clam digger

Abstract: Correction published Tuesday, March 26, 1996: A quote was attributed incorrectly Saturday in a Page 1A story about browntail moths. Steve Train, a lobsterman on Long Island, said he fears the pesticide used to kill the moths would also kill lobsters. He said, ``I think they ought to leave it alone. I agree the moths are uncomfortable, and if they were running up and down Lewiston, then spray Lewiston. But we're on the ocean, and it affects the lobster immensely.'' It was a reporter's error. Coastal areas from Portland to Cumberland can expect aerial spraying in May to fight infestations of browntail moths, which cause respiratory problems and an itchy rash.

Full text: Correction published Tuesday, March 26, 1996: A quote was attributed incorrectly Saturday in a Page 1A story about browntail moths. Steve Train, a lobsterman on Long Island, said he fears the pesticide used to kill the moths would also kill lobsters. He said, ``I think they ought to leave it alone. I agree the moths are uncomfortable, and if they were running up and down Lewiston, then spray Lewiston. But we're on the ocean, and it affects the lobster immensely.'' It was a reporter's error.
Coastal areas from Portland to Cumberland can expect aerial spraying in May to fight infestations of browntail moths, which cause respiratory problems and an itchy rash.
Spraying of the pesticide Dimilin may provide relief to many residents, but lobstermen fear it will get into the ocean and harm lobsters.
Spraying is planned during the first three weeks of May on Great Diamond and Cushing islands in Portland, Clapboard Island in Falmouth and the Sturdevant islands in Cumberland.
Plans for Portland's Peaks Island and a small area of Falmouth Foreside are being finalized by the state departments of Environmental Protection and Marine Resources, and the Maine Forest Service. Cumberland Foreside plans to use ground spraying.
All of the spraying to be done has local approval.
Browntail moths have spread throughout much of Maine's southern coast, said Dick Bradbury, an entomologist for the forestservice. "We've found individual webs as far south as Kittery, as far north as Rockland, and inland as far as Lisbon Falls."
Aerial spraying of Dimilin is designed to kill the moth in its caterpillar stage, in which it sheds prickly, venomous hairs.
Bradbury said the timing of the effort depends on weather, tides and the development of the caterpillars.
Spraying cannot be done during windy or rainy weather, because wind would scatter the chemical and rain would prevent it from sticking to thetrees where the caterpillars live.
Bradbury also said spraying is done during high tide, because "there's a greater volume of water. If something occurred in the water, there would be a much greater dilution effect so it wouldn't damage the wildlife."
And he said the effort must wait until the caterpillars start coming out of their webs.
No spraying will take place within 100 feet of the water, Bradbury said.
That doesn't comfort Bob Coppersmith, a lobsterman who owns the Fishermen's Net seafood store on Forest Avenue in Portland.
Dimilin can disrupt the molting of shellfish, preventing the outer portion of the skin from hardening. When that happens to lobsters, they burst through their soft outer shells and die.
"I think they ought to leave it alone," Coppersmith said. "I agree the moths are uncomfortable, and if they were running up and down Lewiston, then spray Lewiston. But we're on the ocean, and it affects the lobster immensely."
Mary Evelyn Hults, a Peaks Island resident, also wants to avoid spraying.
"I'd like to see it treated naturally," she said. "All of the things they've used in the South for hundreds of years, they've never gotten rid of the boll weevil."
But Hults isn't chastising anyone who wants to use the chemical.
Last summer, she and her husband, Harry, had respiratory troubles, and he got the itchy rash.
"Harry was very miserable," Hults said. "He never had a full night's sleep. I don't want Harry to go through another miserable summer."
Bradbury said he wouldn't recommend spraying Dimilin so close to the ocean if the moths didn't pose such a health problem.
"We're trying to balance medical concerns with the lobsters," Bradbury said. "I hope in the long run it will show that we have taken responsible actions here . . . We're kind of between the proverbial rock and a hard place."
The city of Portland is paying to spray its islands. In other communities, neighborhood associations and other private groups are paying.
Residents of areas where spraying has been rejected can fight the moths by hand.
"From now until the end of April, anyone with webs in their trees can clip the webs," Bradbury said.
Once the silky webs are removed, people can burn them or soak them in soapy water for several days to kill the caterpillars, he said. "If they clip them and put them on the ground, they've wasted their time, because the larvae will survive." ____________________________________________________________________ ___

CLAM-LICENSING LOOPHOLE PROVES BOON TO POACHERS FREEPORT WILL CONSIDER NEW LICENSING RESTRICTIONS IN ITS CLAM CONSERVATION ORDINANCE AT AN APRIL 2 PUBLIC HEARING.

Abstract: Terry Lee Smith has been digging clams from Maine mud flats for 18 years. It's hard work, and Smith has seen it grow harder because of poaching. Coastal communities along the Maine coast have seeded mud flats with baby clams and limited the number of digging licenses to protect clam populations. But poachers have used a loophole in state and local licensingto circumvent those restrictions. People who have been unable to get commercial licenses from towns have bought less expensive, recreational licenses to gain access to the mud flats, then have taken more than the one-peck-per-day limit.

Full text: Terry Lee Smith has been digging clams from Maine mud flats for 18 years. It's hard work, and Smith has seen it grow harder because of poaching.
Coastal communities along the Maine coast have seeded mud flats with baby clams and limited the number of digging licenses to protect clam populations. But poachers have used a loophole in state and local licensingto circumvent those restrictions.
People who have been unable to get commercial licenses from towns have bought less expensive, recreational licenses to gain access to the mud flats, then have taken more than the one-peck-per-day limit. By also carrying state commercial licenses, those poachers have been able to sell their catch.
"You got so many people digging, it killed itself," Smith said. "Some of them guys were camping out and literally taking out two or three bushels a night five orsix days a week."
Several coastal communities are trying to close the licensing loophole.
On Tuesday, Freeport became the latest town to consider new licensing restrictions in its clam conservation ordinance. The Town Council scheduled a public hearing on the changes for April 2.
Under the proposed ordinance, anyone who carries a state commercial license will be unable to get a recreational license from the town. If someone gets a state commercial license after they buy a town recreational license, the town license will be voided. The new rules would go into effect May 1.
Harpswell, Phippsburg, Surry and Rockport have passed similar rules, and Kennebunkport and West Bath have ordinances pending.
"There's been a heck of a lot of pilfering going on over the years - poaching, if you will," said Mick McGivaren, chairman of the Freeport Shellfish Commission. "(The ordinance) is going to catch a few of them by surprise."
Harold Winters, watershed manager for the state Department of Marine Resources, said poaching can hamstring efforts to protect clam flats for diggers who follow the rules.
"For it to work, everybody has to buy into it," he said. "That's not happening."
Most of the poaching has been reported in southern Maine, Winters said. He attributed much of it to longtime diggers who don't want to be told where they can dig or how many clams they can take.
"A lot of diggers don't believe in the towns' programs and wish they'd go away," Winters said. "They feel their rights have been infringed on."
Freeport's Clam Warden Mike Hogan said he has found few poachers. He said he might find six people a year poaching clams, often in July and August.
But clam diggers like Terry Lee Smith say they've seen a lot more.
When the digging is good, so many poachers swoop in to raid the clam flats that the licensed commercial diggers joke about two shifts - a daytime group of legal diggers and a night shift of poachers, Smith said.
"If you're trying to make a life of it," he said, "you don't need somebody else out there with the seagulls, wiping out what you're trying to make a living on."

Full text: Amid the hoopla of Aucocisco, Portland city boosters will announce a new report giving an optimistic assessment of the port's diverse strengths. But the announcement won't be made too loudly.
In deference to Searsport, the city's midcoast cousin, people from the Waterfront Task Force of the Chamber of Commerce of the Greater Portland Region are trying not to trumpet their new report, "Imagine a Great Seaport."
Morale in Searsport sagged after the state decided less than three weeks ago not to build a major cargo port on Sears Island. In the Portland report, the Searsport project is described as a threat and potential competitor.
Now the midcoast city has Portland's sympathies.
"We're just real concerned not to be perceived as trying to take advantage of Searsport when Searsport is down," said Don Perkins, a member of the Waterfront Task Force.
In fact, the task force report has been in the works for more than a year. The group met regularly with representatives from all sectors of the waterfront community - commercial fishing, cargo handling, passenger and cruise ship operations, oil transport and spill cleanup, ship building and repair and chandleries, recreational boating, shellfish harvesting and aquaculture, and marine research, education and technology.
Its conclusions: The "niche port" strategy works, the port is profiting from diversity, and strong business and governmental leadership are guiding the port.
The report identifies some potential troubles within the diversity, such as conflict between recreational boaters and other commercial waterfront users. Rather than choose sides, the report favors having it all.
One goal reads: "Encourage the development of plans for major waterfront projects and investment, including bulk cargo, passenger operations, container service, commercial fishing, recreational boating and construction of an aquarium."
Thomas Valleau, the city's waterfront director, said such reports tend not to favor one segment over another. "One of the things that's wonderful about this report is enduring and widespread support for everything (the port) does," he said.
Perkins will talk about the report at 3:15 p.m. Sunday at DiMillo's Floating Restaurant, on the upper level. "We're just real concerned not to be perceived as trying to take advantage of Searsport." Don Perkins, member, Waterfront Task Force

Abstract: Bad weather at sea has further delayed the arrival of the vessel to be used in dredging the harbor, meaning the project may not be completed this season, Town Manager Mark Green said Monday. In addition to bad weather, delays in getting funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers put the $566,000 project off almost two weeks, said Francis Burnham, owner of the Salem, Mass.,-based company that will do the dredging. The dredge is scheduled to leave Salem today and should arrive within two days, Burnham said. The dredge is towed by a tug traveling at 4 mph and in good weather, the trip should take 16 to 18 hours.

Full text: Bad weather at sea has further delayed the arrival of the vessel to be used in dredging the harbor, meaning the project may not be completed this season, Town Manager Mark Green said Monday.
The dredge was to have arrived by March 1, but as of Monday it still wasn't here.
In addition to bad weather, delays in getting funding from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers put the $566,000 project off almost two weeks, said Francis Burnham, owner of the Salem, Mass.,-based company that will do the dredging.
The dredge is scheduled to leave Salem today and should arrive within two days, Burnham said. The dredge is towed by a tug traveling at 4 mph and in good weather, the trip should take 16 to 18 hours.
By contract, the work must be done by June 1. And with possible further weather delays during the project, there is no time cushion left to account for them, Green said.
"We're getting antsy," he said at town hall, discussing the planned dredging of 60,000 cubic yards of silt from two areas of the harbor to prevent boats from scraping bottom at low tide. "There may not be enough time to get it done before the summer boating season."
Meanwhile, down at the harbor, Gordon Parry, harbormaster, and Tad Bloomberg, assistant harbormaster, maintained a nervous vigil from their police boat at Town Dock No. 2, hoping the project will begin soon.
They are anxious for the dredging boat will arrive. "It all depends on the weather," he said, scanning the horizon.
Burnham promised Monday that his equipment should be on the way this morning. "It should arrive in a day ortwo," he said from Salem.
The dredging is designed to clear the mooring areas to a depth of 8 feet at low tide. Currently the ocean floor juts above the low-water mark in many places, making navigation impossible.
The dredging is supposed to be done within 90 days. The material dredged from the harbor will be dumped off the coast of Kennebunkport in an area known as Cape Arundel.
The two mooring areas being dredged were created roughly 30 years ago. They were last dredged in 1975, but that dredging wasn't completed because of fears the shellfish beds were being damaged.
Town officials said the fears were overblown - that the shellfish won't be harmed. In fact, under a new state regulation, any dredging after April 15 will be restricted to certain hours. Until then, dredging can be done around the clock.
But after April 15, state fisheries officials said, lobsters will be spawning and fish will be migrating. They limit dredging to prevent disruption of the life cycles of the fishery.
Asked Monday whether he can finish the dredging by June 1, Burnham said, "It's going to be a tight squeak. If we can't, we'll have to come back in the fall."
Parry is afraid of that. If the dredging isn't done before the summer boating and fishing season begins, hundreds of moorings that were pulled from the harbor to make way for the dredging will have to be put back in, and then taken out again in the fall.
If this happens, the town will end up shouldering the cost of replacing the moorings, Parry said.

UMAINE ECOLOGIST HAS BETTER IDEA FOR HELPING CLAM FLATS

Author: Edie Lau, a staff writer, covers marine issues for The Portland Newspapers.

Abstract: Today, that batch of clams is still noticeably abundant, but hardly the same. "Many ofthem got eaten by ducks, taken off by ice, wiped out by storms," said [Brian] Beal, an associate professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. He figures 80 to 90 percent died. To guard against clams' early death, Beal proposes scooping up the rich mud in late fall and protecting it in containers kept in a sheltered cove. Seed clams preserved this way at the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery near Jonesport have an 85 to 95 percent survival rate, Beal said. "Clean water does not equal clams. Quite frankly, the clams couldn't give a damn whether there's fecal coliform in the water," he said, referring to the bacteria that closes clam flats. "What controls the distribution and abundance of clams is ecology and biology."

Full text: The popular approach to protecting clam flats in Maine has been to clean up the water and monitor its purity. Now one of the state's foremost clam experts says that's not enough.
After sampling the mud for baby clams on Swans Island since 1984, Brian Beal has found that the tiny shellfish are getting clobbered long before they grow big enough to be harvested.
In 1994, his mud sample was virtually overflowing with larval clams - about 100 clams per sample (pulled with a two-pound coffee can), compared with two or three in previous years.
Today, that batch of clams is still noticeably abundant, but hardly the same. "Many ofthem got eaten by ducks, taken off by ice, wiped out by storms," said Beal, an associate professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. He figures 80 to 90 percent died.
To guard against clams' early death, Beal proposes scooping up the rich mud in late fall and protecting it in containers kept in a sheltered cove. Seed clams preserved this way at the Beals Island Regional Shellfish Hatchery near Jonesport have an 85 to 95 percent survival rate, Beal said.
In spring, the tiny clams can be planted on the flats like grass seed on a lawn. To further protect the clams, the seeded areas may be covered with mesh netting.
Programs to protect baby clams would do more to bring about good clam harvests than monitoring water quality, which simply ensures that the clams harvested are safe for human consumption, Beal maintains.
"Clean water does not equal clams. Quite frankly, the clams couldn't give a damn whether there's fecal coliform in the water," he said, referring to the bacteria that closes clam flats. "What controls the distribution and abundance of clams is ecology and biology."
Aucocisco events center this year on weekends
This year, Aucocisco, a festival celebrating Casco Bay, is scheduled with working folks in mind. Instead of parceling out events over the course of a week, as in the past, most of the activities are clustered during the next two weekends.
For example, on Saturday, 25 different things are going on, from cruises on the bay to lectures to tours of a visiting ocean-survey ship. The following weekend brings two boat shows. To receive a free schedule by mail, call Portland's Downtown District, 772-6828.
Two workshops planned on alternative careers
The Fishing Community Resource Center in Portland is hosting two workshops for people interested in alternatives to fishing:
How to Start Your Own Small Business, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday.
Aquaculture workshop, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. March 18.
Call 879-9281 to reserve a space. The center is located off Commercial Street in the Marine Trade Center, Suite 105.
Marine career center goes to a full-time schedule
Demand for training for careers at sea is so good that a Portland business that used to offer only correspondence-style courses now has its own space in Portland's Marine Trade Center.
The Maine Exam Prep Center opened full time last week in Suite 214 with computers, VCRs, a library and room to train up to 18 people at a time, said John Dwyer, the coordinator.
The center used to operate part time from Long Wharf, helping students study from home, Dwyer said.
Ocean description query brings imaginative reply
How would you describe the ocean to someone who's never been there? In answer to our question last week, Katherine Brooks of Portland offered a long, imaginative description that reads in part:
"The ocean consists of a lot of water that keeps trying to reach the shore. . . . It is full of things with spines, bones and shells. . . . You can swim in it if youlike salt, but only as long as your breath holds out. It's easier to stand on the shore and wave back."
This week, we'd like to know: What are early signs of spring on Casco Bay?
Answer by calling 800-499-0043 or via BayNet, a Press Herald Internet site at http://www.portland.com
FACES ON THE WATERFRONT
Name: Susan J. Clark
Occupation: Harbor commissioner
Location: Portland
Job description: A graduate of Maine Maritime Academy, Clark sailed around the world for Exxon Shipping Co. for six years, then studied law before returning in 1994 to her native state. A lawyer now, Clark recently was recruited to the harbor commission, where she can use her wide knowledge in piloting and ports. Learning the ins and outs of the local harbor - from shipping to managing moorings to dredging - gives her a break from the formal, sometimes sterile law-office environment and an excuse to get to know waterfront business people.
Quote: "It's such a small port, they are amenable to letting me tag along, including me in things."

Abstract: The day for hearts and flowers led to a Valentines Ball last weekend. Dozens of red balloons decorated the tables and ceiling at the Italian Heritage Center, the setting for the first major fund-raiser of the Portland Fire Department Auxiliary. Kathy Newcomb founded the group four months ago in order to bring area firefighters and their supporters together. Kathy emphasized the auxiliary is not for women only. "Membership is open to everyone," she stated. All proceeds will benefit agencies serving women and children, Newcomb added. Money raised at the first event will go to the Family Crisis Center in memory of Kelley J. Newcomb, a homicide victim last fall. Kelley was the daughter of Kathy's husband, Steve Newcomb. The "dress code"at the dance centered on red, white and black. Manning the ticket table, wearing respective evening fashions of black, were Cindy Pellerin, Judy Magnuson and Leslie Young. Janelle Fillinger, vocalist for "The Waiters" who was waiting to go on, wore a short black dress trimmed with white flounces. In answer to a question, she said some of the musicians are waiters and some are not.

The day for hearts and flowers led to a Valentines Ball last weekend. Dozens of red balloons decorated the tables and ceiling at the Italian Heritage Center, the setting for the first major fund-raiser of the Portland Fire Department Auxiliary. Kathy Newcomb founded the group four months ago in order to bring area firefighters and their supporters together. Kathy emphasized the auxiliary is not for women only. "Membership is open to everyone," she stated.
All proceeds will benefit agencies serving women and children, Newcomb added. Money raised at the first event will go to the Family Crisis Center in memory of Kelley J. Newcomb, a homicide victim last fall. Kelley was the daughter of Kathy's husband, Steve Newcomb.
The "dress code"at the dance centered on red, white and black. Manning the ticket table, wearing respective evening fashions of black, were Cindy Pellerin, Judy Magnuson and Leslie Young. Janelle Fillinger, vocalist for "The Waiters" who was waiting to go on, wore a short black dress trimmed with white flounces. In answer to a question, she said some of the musicians are waiters and some are not.
Steve Newcomb described himself as debonair. He was quite so in a gray double-breasted suit, designer shirt (R.L.), mutedprint tie and lizard shoes he tagged as Gucci. Kathy, an interior designer, designed and created a black velvet gown for the occasion.
Charles Loring was busy in the lobby, posing people for souvenir photos. Loring, a pilot on the Portland fireboat, was a photographer for the department's first yearbook.
The chairman and committee sold 300 tickets to the Valentines Ball. They thanked everyone attending, as well as the business people who contributed door prizes.
DUE TO SPACE problems, a recent event was left simmering on the back burner. However, I'm still savoring the joy of judging the Great Chili and Chowder Challenge, almost a yearly staple at Holiday Inn by the Bay. The tasting session benefits the Foster Grandparent Program, which is sponsored by the People's Regional Opportunity Program. According to Susan Lavigne of the FGP staff, more than 120 PROP foster grandparents work with young children, teen-agers and families at risk.
Grant Lee, PROP executive director, and Lyle Cramer, agency board president, were among 20 judges settling in for early sampling before 900 people entered to browse for lunch. Anita Chandler was in charge of the judges' session. She quickly distributed unmarked portions among the chowder and chili tasters. To avoid complications, she allowed one judge to switch teams because he's allergic to shellfish. Portland Police Chief Michael Chitwood, another judge, made sure that the chili-chooser and all others were kept honest.
They say chili is chili and chowder is chowder, and never the twain shall meet. Well, 25 restaurants and food suppliers did meet, booth to booth, in the Casco Bay Exhibit Hall. Chilis ranged from mild to spicy; chowders ran the gamut from very good to not so. The buffet included such extra treats as ice cream and fresh bakery bread. The Scarborough Sax Quartet contributed music to munch by.
The winners were announced by Cheryl Doyle, representing WCSH-TV 6 Alive. The People's Choice Award for chili went to the Village Tie-Up of Harrison. Thesame award, in the chowder category, went to Allie's American Grill at the Portland Mariott. The judges' chowder scores added up to a win for Allie's, also. For chili, the judges favored the Casco Bay Restaurant at Portland International Airport. Laposada restaurant in Saco earned honors for its Tex-Mex display.
The food fest raised approximately $8,600 for the Foster Grandparent Program.
A WHOLE LOT of families followed a yellow brick road to the Maine Mall. The road wasn't real, of course. It wasthe subject of a song in "The Wizard of Oz Revue." Three traveling troupes present "Wizard" and other classics at malls, fairs and conventions throughout the country, explained Henry Martin. Martin, of Las Vegas, heads the Children's Entertainment Co.
Movie music played as the performers whirled on stage from behind an emerald green and gold curtain. The Scarecrow's costume matched the curtain, color-wise. The Tin Man was shiny, from top to toe. The Cowardly Lion was sort of a cross between Bert Lahr and Jason Alexander. Dorothy was perfect in pigtails, checkered pinafore and red, sparkly shoes. When she's not on the road (yellow brick or otherwise,) the Chicago resident occasionally sings the national anthem at Black Hawks and Chicago Bulls games.
Parents in the crowd seemed to favor "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." The youngsters listened quietly, but squirmed a bit. They preferred the action involved when characters chased each other around the stage. Near the happy ending, the boys and girls clapped and shouted to "We're Off to See the Wizard."
Martin and the musical foursome held a "meet and greet" session with the audience after the show. A supply of T-shirts, souvenir pins and photos was available to fans.

Abstract: "Come March, it's clam chowder," Robert Foley, selectmen's chairman, said Thursday in anticipation of next week's reopening of the clam flats. For the first time since 1987, the town's clam flats will open for limited weekend recreational digging. They were closed nine years ago by widespread pollution. Recreational clamming licenses are expected to go on sale next week at town hall, though the date has yet to be set. Resident permits will cost about $15, and digging should begin Thursday, according to Marshall Boston of the Wells Clam Commission.

Full text: The town once known as the clam capital of Maine is attempting to regain its reputation as the place to come for those succulent shellfish.
"Come March, it's clam chowder," Robert Foley, selectmen's chairman, said Thursday in anticipation of next week's reopening of the clam flats.
For the first time since 1987, the town's clam flats will open for limited weekend recreational digging. They were closed nine years ago by widespread pollution.
Recreational clamming licenses are expected to go on sale next week at town hall, though the date has yet to be set. Resident permits will cost about $15, and digging should begin Thursday, according to Marshall Boston of the Wells Clam Commission.
For the past five years, town, state and federal officials sought to identify the sources of the pollution that forced the closing of the flats in 1987.
With the help of the Southern Maine Regional Planning Commission and the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve, the town did a shoreline survey of the Webhannet River estuary.
The survey showed that some pollution was coming from malfunctioning septic systems and open sewer pipes. Repairs to the septic systems were made and open pipes closed off, resulting in a cleansing of part of the flats.
"The clams have flushed themselves and are clean," Foley said. "It's a real good sign. We have turned the tide, so to speak, and will open our flats March 1 until the end of April."
An estimated one-half square mile of the 3-mile flats, between Wells Harbor and Drakes Island, will be opened for limited recreational digging, Foley said.
The flats will be opened on weekends only and each person with a license can dig a maximum of a peck - eight quarts - of clams in 24 hours, Boston said. He expects about 350 resident permits and 38 nonresident permits to be available. In 1987, the last time licenses were available, 230 resident permits and 30 nonresident permits were sold.
Boston, 73, said he remembers digging clams as a boy in the town where it was a tradition.
"The old natives here, we dug clams since we were kids, and that's a privilege we enjoyed, eating clams," Boston said. "They're awful good eating."
The reopening of the flats "says a lot for the people working together, having such determination," said Kate Albert, coastal coordinator of the Southern Maine Regional Planning Commission. "They've been wanting to do this for years."
Before the clam flats were closed in 1987, the clams that were dug were subjected to a 48-hour cleansing process known as depuration. Officials don't expect that to be necessary this time.
Looking back on the efforts to reopen the flats, Boston mentioned the many hurdles officials have had to overcome. If the clams weren't polluted, then they were either being eaten by green crabs or, in the case of baby clams, being smothered by the movement of the tidal sands.
"It's been an uphill battle," he said. Boston is anxious for the reopening to finally occur.
Along Maine's coast, clam flats are constantly monitored by the Maine Department of Marine Resources for pollution, said Paul Anderson, director of the department's shellfish sanitation program.
He said shellfish beds are closed and reopened periodically, depending on the extent of pollution.
While the Wells flats have been closed for nearly 10 years, others, such as those in Portland, Belfast and Rockland, have been closed for decades, Anderson said. And others, such as Scarborough, are opened and closed sometimes more than once a year, depending on pollution. "The clams have flushed themselves and are clean. That's a good sign . . ."

Abstract: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began preparing Wednesday for the first dredging of York Harbor in 20 years, surveying the two mooring areas where the work will be done. The dredging project is designed to clear the mooring areas to a depth of 8 feet at low tide. Currently, the ocean floor juts above the low-water mark in many places, making navigation impossible. By Sunday, the floats and mooring blocks in the harbor will have been moved to make way for the dredge, said Tad Bloomberg, assistant harbor master. The floats and mooring blocks are being moved out of the harbor to property along the shore.

Full text: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began preparing Wednesday for the first dredging of York Harbor in 20 years, surveying the two mooring areas where the work will be done.
The actual dredging, to be done by Burnham Associates of Salem, Mass., is expected to begin in a week.
The dredging project is designed to clear the mooring areas to a depth of 8 feet at low tide. Currently, the ocean floor juts above the low-water mark in many places, making navigation impossible.
Wednesday's work by the Army Corps of Engineers crews entailed putting markers on the land around the harbor that will be used as a guide by the dredging contractor.
By Sunday, the floats and mooring blocks in the harbor will have been moved to make way for the dredge, said Tad Bloomberg, assistant harbor master. The floats and mooring blocks are being moved out of the harbor to property along the shore.
Town Manager Mark Green said the dredging project, several years in planning, will be a welcome relief for fishermen and pleasure boaters whose boats get caught in the sandy harbor.
The dredging is expected to take 2 1/2 months. The 60,000 cubic yards of dredging spoils removed from the harbor will be dumped off the coast of Kennebunkport in an area known as Cape Arundel.
Burnham Associates was the second-lowest bidder on the project, charging $566,800.
A lower bid submitted by a company from Middletown, N.Y., was rejected due to several problems with it, said Ed O'Donnell, who is managing the project for the corps.
The dredging will be done around the clock, seven days a week, weather permitting. The boat on which the dredged materials are dumped will make one trip a day to the dumping ground off Cape Arundel.
The two mooring areas being dredged were created roughly 30 years ago. They were last dredged in 1975, but that dredging wasn't completed because of fears the shellfish beds were being damaged.
Maurice Payne, the town's assistant shellfish warden, said he's pleased to see the dredging being done. Payne said he's not worried that the dredging will harm the shellfish, such as clams.
"In fact," he said, "I question whether it had as bad an effect on the shellfish" as when the issue was first raised in 1975.
Since the last dredging, the 6-acre mooring area located near Newick's Island has filled in with silt, causing some boats to scrape bottom, according to Bloomberg.
Payne said the fishermen who work in the area welcome the dredging because it will prevent their boats from grounding when leaving and entering the harbor.

Abstract: [Penny] Marshall, director of "The Preacher's Wife," flew into Portland last weekend and spent Sunday shopping for antiques. She snapped up enough to fill "quite a few Land Cruiser loads," said Sam Hutchins, the film's assistant location manager. Merriweather Productions, which has descended on Deering Oaks this week to film a single scene of "The Preacher's Wife," is throwing money in lots of unexpected directions. The filmmakers bought hockey pucks from the Portland Pirates and plumbing supplies and firewood from other vendors. They rented an American Legion post and made plans for possibly shooting at a Portland law office. They paid residents of Park Avenue to festoon their apartments with Christmas decorations.

Full text: Penny Marshall came to Maine to make a movie, but she's also doing a lot of shopping.
Marshall, director of "The Preacher's Wife," flew into Portland last weekend and spent Sunday shopping for antiques. She snapped up enough to fill "quite a few Land Cruiser loads," said Sam Hutchins, the film's assistant location manager.
Her one-day spree cost a cool $51,000, said Elizabeth Darling, a marketing and promotion specialist for Portland's economic development department.
Merriweather Productions, which has descended on Deering Oaks this week to film a single scene of "The Preacher's Wife," is throwing money in lots of unexpected directions.
The filmmakers bought hockey pucks from the Portland Pirates and plumbing supplies and firewood from other vendors. They rented an American Legion post and made plans for possibly shooting at a Portland law office. They paid residents of Park Avenue to festoon their apartments with Christmas decorations.
"They're buying up things right and left," Darling said Wednesday. She estimates that the film will generate at least $500,000 in local business.
That figure could rise if bad weather prolongs the shooting. Hutchins said the filming will be done Friday night at the earliest and could possibly be extended through Tuesday.
The film is a remake of the 1947 Christmas fantasy "The Bishop's Wife." It is scheduled for release next Christmas.
Most of the crew, numbering about 112, are staying at theRadisson Eastland Hotel. Marshall has her room outfitted with several televisions and VCRs, so she can check the footage at night, Hutchins said.
At least one of the stars, Whitney Houston, was said to be staying at the Portland Regency Hotel, but the hotel's general manager would not confirm that. Houston and co-stars Denzel Washington and Courtney B. Vance all brought their own security officers.
The cast and crew have patronized several local restaurants, including Street and Co., Bella Bella, DiMillo's and Back Bay Grill.
Houston and Washington ordered carryout - veal parmegian, veal piccata and linguine with marinara sauce - earlier this week from G'Vanni's restaurant on Wharf Street. Marshall and an entourage have dined several times at J's Oyster Bar.
Wednesday's unseasonably warm weather caused big headaches for the production company. Three inches of water covered the skating pond at Deering Oaks, where the scene is being shot.
"We were panicking," said Darling. "People were getting ready to swim."
The production company shelled out lots of money - although how much was not clear - trying to find a solution. First, they brought in pumps to suck up the water, but that didn't work, Darling said. Then they called in a Portland fire engine to use its pump, but that didn't work, either.
Finally, the city's sewer division arrived with more pumps. Within an hour, they had most of the water off the pond, Darling said. The city will be reimbursed for all of its expenses connected to the film, she added.
"As long as we have enough ice to stand on, we can keep filming," Hutchins said as he stood on soggy ground at Deering Oaks Wednesday. But he acknowledged that the pools of water on the pond forced the crew to limit their shots to close-ups.
Throughout the day, two tractor trailers drove back and forth to New Bedford, Mass., hauling ice to make more snow.
The crew also made preparations to shoot three indoor scenes if rain forces them off the ice.
They transformedthe commander's office at American Legion Post No. 17 on Deering Street into a church vestry, with photographs of African Americans and a dark-skinned Jesus on the walls. Upstairs, they turned a community room into a senior citizen center, all ready for a Christmas party.
The two scenes at the Legion post will take about a day and a half to shoot, Hutchins said. A cast of about 40 extras, different from the ones used at the skating pond, will be called, he said.
Marshall also wanted an upscale office for a third shot. The Portland law firm of Verrill & Dana has agreed to allow filming in its reception area. It is not clear at this point whether that shooting will take place.
Although some crew members were grumbling about the warm, wet weather, Marshall seemed to take it in stride.
"She gets fresh seafood," said Hutchins. "She gets antiques. And she loves the outlet stores (in Freeport and Kittery). She couldn't be happier."

Abstract: The marine-mammal stranding staff at Allied Whale in Bar Harbor recently was called to look at a couple of hooded seals loafing on land. Unlike the harbor and gray seals so abundant in the state's waters, perfectly healthy ice seals sometimes end up on people's front lawns, said Tom Fernald, the stranding co-ordinator. The panel - composed of salmon growers, scientists, environmentalists and state officials - did evaluate an array of measures to fend off seal attacks on salmon. The measures they endorse include using nets to keep seals out, making "bubble curtains" by pumping air around the pens to obscure the fish from seals' view, and using "seal bombs" - underwater explosives that scare but don't kill the animals.

Full text: Seals you expect to see only in the ice fields of Canada continue to show up in Maine.
The marine-mammal stranding staff at Allied Whale in Bar Harbor recently was called to look at a couple of hooded seals loafing on land.
Unlike the harbor and gray seals so abundant in the state's waters, perfectly healthy ice seals sometimes end up on people's front lawns, said Tom Fernald, the stranding co-ordinator.
In the most recent cases, one was on a beach in Manset, the other on a fishing dock on Swans Island.
The seals were fine. The stranding people tagged their flippers, so that if someone finds the animals on Long Island in New York - or wherever - they'll know how far the seals ranged.
A year-old harp seal that showed up on the shore in Perry in late January was not OK. He'd been shot in the head.
The animal was still alive and was treated by a local veterinarian, Fernald said. Then it was sent to the New England Aquarium, where the staff decided to euthanize it. "They thought it was in a lot of pain," Fernald said.
The issue of shooting seals is a touchy one Down East, where aquaculturists have trouble protecting their penned salmon from hungry seals.
Coincidentally, a task force examining the problem of seals feeding from salmon pens is scheduled to discuss its findings Tuesday at the Washington County Technical College Marine Trade Center in Eastport,from 3 to 5 p.m. and 6:30 to 8 p.m.
The task force couldn't agree on whether to recommend that the government let fish farmers kill seals to protect their property. It's a federal offense to kill marine mammals.
The panel - composed of salmon growers, scientists, environmentalists and state officials - did evaluate an array of measures to fend off seal attacks on salmon. The measures they endorse include using nets to keep seals out, making "bubble curtains" by pumping air around the pens to obscure the fish from seals' view, and using "seal bombs" - underwater explosives that scare but don't kill the animals.
New enforcer watching over Scarborough harbor
There's a new guy in charge of the Scarborough harbor and shellfish beds. David Corbeau has replaced Richard Haehnel as the town harbormaster.
Corbeau, 35, has been in law enforcement in Scarborough for 16 years as a reserve sergeant. In his new job, he's learning the rules of the water - speed limits, drinking laws, handling moorings - and the trick to walking on clam flats.
"I learned that when I landed up to my waist the first day in mud," Corbeau admitted cheerfully. "My radio, my gun were covered in mud."
Corbeau inherits a shellfish conservation program considered one of the most successful in the state. Under Haehnel's watch, the harvestable flats in town expanded from 50 to roughly 200 acres.
Haehnel, 62, was the harbormaster for nine years.
Portland Marine Society marks its bicentennial
An organization older than Maine itself, the Portland Marine Society, celebrates its 200th anniversary Saturday.
The society of mariners was founded in 1796 "to promote the knowledge of navigation and seamanship, the relief of decayed and disabled seamen and the poor widows and orphans of deceased seamen." Maine became a state 24 years later.
The group remains active today with 96 members, though its focus has shifted with the times. "Obviously, we don't have that many seamen going to sea out of Portland, mariners lost at sea and widows," said Bob Bent, a society member.
One of the society's primary contributions now is to give scholarships to students at Maine Maritime Academy and Southern Maine Technical College.
The group also hopes to help restore the Portland Observatory, which was closed indefinitely last spring after city officials found the tower's wooden foundation seriously damaged by beetles.
One of the founders of the marine society was Lemuel Moody, whose influence was key in buildingthe observatory in 1807.
Bird-watchers invited to share favorite sites
Last week, we asked about good places to park with your valentine by Casco Bay. Donny Apon of Portland offered several: Fort Allen on Portland's East End; Cutter Street, also on the East End; and the town landing in Falmouth.
Our question this week is: Where are good places to watch birds on Casco Bay?

Abstract: A passionate and opinionated crowd is expected at Tuesday's Town Council meeting when councilors are scheduled to vote on an ordinance that would regulate boating. The ordinance, which would require boaters to register moorings and would empower the harbor master to determine mooring locations, has split both the council and the community. "Every year it's more and more noisy and crowded," said Lucia Linhard, who owns a home on Mere Point. "We just want to see things slow down and to see somebody keep an eye on our waters."

Full text: A passionate and opinionated crowd is expected at Tuesday's Town Council meeting when councilors are scheduled to vote on an ordinance that would regulate boating.
The ordinance, which would require boaters to register moorings and would empower the harbor master to determine mooring locations, has split both the council and the community.
Many shoreline property owners say the town needs the regulations to protect against crowding and pollution.
"Every year it's more and more noisy and crowded," said Lucia Linhard, who owns a home on Mere Point. "We just want to see things slow down and to see somebody keep an eye on our waters."
But many boaters saythere is no crowding or pollution and that the ordinance would unnecessarily add to the town's bureaucracy.
"I think they are solving a problem that doesn't exist," said Charles Hurley, who has moored his boat in Brunswick waters for 26 years. "I think some of the environmental people just dislike that there are any boats there at all."
Both sides will voice their opinions at the public hearing before the vote. The meeting starts at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at the old Brunswick High School on McKeen Street.
"I expect a large number of people will attend," said Stephen McCausland, the council chairman. "Many councilors have been approached by many people both pro and con."
Development of a waterways ordinance has been under way since July, when the council imposed a moratorium for moorings that is still in place. Coastal property owners prompted the effort by complaining that the waters in front of their land were becoming increasingly crowded with moorings.
Unlike surrounding communities, Brunswick does not have a local ordinance governing its waterways. It permits boaters to moor where they choose free of charge.
Last week, the town staff offered the council a choice of two ordinances. One requires registration but lets boaters moor where they choose. The other lets the harbor master determine the location of the moorings.
With a 5-4 vote the council supported the stricter ordinance and scheduled it for a public hearing and a vote.
The ordinance would set mooring fees of $20 for Brunswick residents and $100 for non-residents. It also would establish a committee to develop policies for Brunswick's waters.
Alan Houston, the town's harbor master, supported the council's action. He said he thinks more boats will start using Brunswick's waters and that the pollution will threaten shellfish populations. He said regulating the location of moorings allows the town to protect sensitive shellfishing areas.
Norm Berge, who lives on Mere Point, said he supports the ordinance. He said his mooring in front of his property used to stand alone, but in the past year three other moorings have been placed within 20 yards of his.
"I think giving the warden control will eliminate the problem," said Berge. "It gives us somebody to talk to if there is crowding."
Ordinance opponents argue that Brunswick's waters naturally protect themselves from crowding, because most areas are too shallow. They add that the areas that are deep enough for moorings aren't easily accessible from land.
Arthur Lane, who has moored his boat in Brunswick for 20 years, said state and federal laws already in place can handle any problems that arise, although he doesn't foresee any.
"I don't see where anybody is being infringed upon," said Lane. "I think they are blowing it all out of proportion."

Abstract: The Portland Sea Dogs pitched a perfect pre-season party last weekend. The minor league team's major event was a dinner and auction to benefit Youth Alternatives, the agency that provides services to families and youth facing crises. Jeanne Pickering, of the YA staff, touched all bases coordinating the innings at the Radisson Eastland Hotel. All the action was underwritten by Peoples Heritage Bank. Lee Perry, president of Youth Alternative's board of directors, thanked Peggy Siegle for bringing the agency and the Sea Dogs together for the first benefit dinner three years ago. "The combination was a natural," said Siegle. "The team had a commitment to the community, and the game is wholesome and good fun for children and families." Peggy, YA's former development director, recently opened Four Seasons Baseball in South Portland. The Siegle family donated four seats at Hadlock Field, four times during the season, to the live auction. Allen and Polly Mapes, in from Springvale, introduced themselves as "baseball nuts." They said they've been "camping out" at the Red Sox training camp in Florida for 26 years. Back home, they spend their summers with the Sea Dogs. The season ticket owners bought an auction item: a skybox for 22 people in May. Polly purchased the Sea Dogs' donation for $700.

The Portland Sea Dogs pitched a perfect pre-season party last weekend. The minor league team's major event was a dinner and auction to benefit Youth Alternatives, the agency that provides services to families and youth facing crises. Jeanne Pickering, of the YA staff, touched all bases coordinating the innings at the Radisson Eastland Hotel. All the action was underwritten by Peoples Heritage Bank.
Baseball memorabilia were up for sale during a silent auction and reception in Cumberland Hall. Moving up to the ballroom, fans gathered for a dinner (surf 'n turf) and program. Gordie Hershiser, NewsChannel 13 sports director, was the master of ceremonies.
Lee Perry, president of Youth Alternative's board of directors, thanked Peggy Siegle for bringing the agency and the Sea Dogs together for the first benefit dinner three years ago. "The combination was a natural," said Siegle. "The team had a commitment to the community, and the game is wholesome and good fun for children and families." Peggy, YA's former development director, recently opened Four Seasons Baseball in South Portland. The Siegle family donated four seats at Hadlock Field, four times during the season, to the live auction.
Allen and Polly Mapes, in from Springvale, introduced themselves as "baseball nuts." They said they've been "camping out" at the Red Sox training camp in Florida for 26 years. Back home, they spend their summers with the Sea Dogs. The season ticket owners bought an auction item: a skybox for 22 people in May. Polly purchased the Sea Dogs' donation for $700.
Among other goods and services quickly disposed of by Harper Sibley, auctioneer, were a pair of pure chocolate baseball bats, created by Haven's Candies. The big, sweet sticks went for $50 each. An item to anticipate is the first annual Youth Alternatives - Locke Office Products Golf tournament. The winning bid for a competitive day of golf was $400.
Michael Tarpinian, YA executive director, was next in line for the speakers' mound. He said the number of at-risk children and families continues to grow. Last year, more than 600 recipients were helped by the agency. The speaker teamed up with Lee Perry to present a gift to Dan Burke, Sea Dogs owner. They unveiled a stained glass replica of the team logo, the work of Nikki Dixon, a Scarborough artist. "Now that we have a couple of hitters, I won't take the piece to the ballpark," commented Burke.
The guest speaker was Bowie Kuhn, the former commissioner of baseball. He spoke about his visit that day to YA's Boys Emergency Shelter. "The program is all about caring," he said, "and the Sea Dogs is a caring organization, too." On a related matter, who would Kuhn care to see as baseball commissioner? His answer: "Margaret Thatcher."
Charles Eshbach, team president and general manager, came up with some statistics. According to his scorecard, the club is averaging 6,000 fans each game. In two years, approximately 800,000 people have been in the stands. Carlos Tosca, Sea Dogs field manager, compared the team and the agency. "Youth Alternatives," he said, "gives kids a chance to `play on."'
John Boles, director of player development for the parent Florida Marlins, praised the excellent relationship between the team and the town. Todd Dunwoody is new to both. The 1996 center fielder came to the Sea Dogs from a Marlins affiliate in Indiana. Dunwoody, 20, spent the week touching bases in Maine and New Hampshire. "Dealing with kids," he said, "the more you give, the more you get in return."
Ending the play was Ken Joyce, a Portland native and the Sea Dogs bullpen coach. Joyce said baseball, youth and families are an important part of his life.
IF IT LOOKS like a theremin and it sounds like a theremin, then it is a theremin. So, what's a theremin? The answer was plain to see and hear at The Movies at Exchange Street. A film titled "Theremin" was about Leon Theremin, inventor of the electronic instrument that perpetuates his name. The recent event was a fund-raiser for the Portland String quartet, with proceeds benefiting the group's educational outreach programs in Maine schools.
Three-quarters of the foursome participated in a discussion on stage after the final notes of "Theremin." Joining Stephen Kecskemethy, Julia Adams and Ronald Lantz were Elliott Schwartz, chairman of the music department at Bowdoin College, and Olivia Mattis, a musicologist at the University of New Hampshire.
Next stop, for supper, was David's Restaurant at the Oyster Club. Eve Richardson chaired the dining session for the audience, assisted by Fran Zilkha, Judith Halpert, Ruth Sylmor and Gail Pelletier, Brian Dorsk arranged for culinary contributions from several other restaurants.
Thanks to Scott Brickman, a genuine theremin was on display. Brickman, a music teacher at the University of Maine in Machias, uses the instrument in his classroom. As everyone could see, the boxy sound machine is bigger than a bread box and it comes complete with two speakers. Norman Brown, of Standish, was there because he owns a theremin. He inherited it from his grandfather, he stated. Brown left his machine at home, but he borrowed Brickman's theremin for a musical demonstration.
THE PORTLAND STRING Quartet, with or without a theremin, will present a Valentine concert today at Woodfords Congregational Church, at 3 p.m.

STRICTER BOATING ORDINANCE ENDORSED BRUNSWICK'S TOWN COUNCIL FAVORS REGULATING MOORINGS, AND ALSO APPROVES HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGES FOR DOWNTOWN.

Abstract: The council had to choose between two boating ordinances. It chose the stricter one, which requires boaters to register their moorings and gives the harbor master the power to assign the location of the moorings. The ordinance will go to a public hearing Feb. 20 and return to the council for a vote. The hearing will probably draw a crowd, because many boaters feel the regulations address a problem that does not exist, while many others say it is an important step to protect the waters from growing boater traffic. The 5-4 vote in favor of the stricter ordinance marks a change of policy for the council. Two weeks ago, the council asked the town staff to draw up only a lenient ordinance that would require boaters to register their moorings, but would let them moor wherever they want.

Full text: The Town Council decided Monday night that strict is better than lenient when it comes to regulating the town's waterways to protect against crowding and pollution.
The council had to choose between two boating ordinances. It chose the stricter one, which requires boaters to register their moorings and gives the harbor master the power to assign the location of the moorings.
The ordinance will charge Brunswick residents $20 for a mooring and non-residents $100, and it establishes a committee that would develop policies for Brunswick's waters.
The ordinance will go to a public hearing Feb. 20 and return to the council for a vote. The hearing will probably draw a crowd, because many boaters feel the regulations address a problem that does not exist, while many others say it is an important step to protect the waters from growing boater traffic.
The 5-4 vote in favor of the stricter ordinance marks a change of policy for the council. Two weeks ago, the council asked the town staff to draw up only a lenient ordinance that would require boaters to register their moorings, but would let them moor wherever they want.
The town staff came back with both the lenient ordinance and the stricter one to offer the council a choice, partly because some town staff members felt the stricter ordinance was needed.
Alan Houston, the town's harbor master, told the council that approving the more lenient ordinance would be like adopting no ordinance at all. He said it's important to be able to assign locations to protect boats from mooring too close together and to protect clam flats from pollution.
"Certainly, boats that will be used for overnight use near open shellfish areas will be a problem," Houston said. "I would think the town would like to be very careful of that, because it's a multimillion-dollar industry."
Councilor Faith Moll, who did not attend the meeting two weeks ago, tipped the scale in favor of the stricter ordinance.
"I feel the assignments are the essential heart of the process," Moll said. "Registration alone is just busywork."
Councilors Clement Wilson, Stephen McCausland, Ervin Snyder and David Gleason voted against the stricter ordinance.
Gleason said the ordinance creates more unnecessary bureaucracy. Brunswick's waterways naturally protect themselves against crowding, he said, because most areas do not have public access from land.
"I don't think people are going to take a small skiff a long way to a mooring," Gleason said.
Arthur Lane, a Brunswick boater, also said the regulations aren't necessary.
"We've been here 20 years and haven't seen a problem," Lane said. "They're trying to regulate something that's not there."
Development of a waterways ordinance has been under way since July, when the council imposed a moratorium on moorings that is still in place. Coastal property owners prompted the effort by complaining that the waters by their land were becoming increasingly crowded with moorings.
Unlike surrounding communities, Brunswick has no local ordinances governing its waterways.
In other action Monday, the council approved a plan to let horse-drawn carriages tour the downtown area. The approval clears the way for Bob Robshaw of Brunswick to launch a carriage service this spring.
Robshaw had asked the town to let him parka carriage on Park Row and offer rides that would run past the Joshua L. Chamberlain museum, through Bowdoin College and by the old homes along Federal and School streets.
The town still must decide where Robshaw can park the carriage. Robshaw, who owns four carriages and three horses, plans to begin offering rides in April. "I feel the (mooring) assignments are the essential heart of the process. Registration alone is just busywork." Faith Moll, councilor

Full text: Every year, 500 tankers and barges skirt the clam flats, lobster beds and seabird colonies of Casco Bay to pump 100 million barrels of petroleum into waterfront pipelines.
As events on the Rhode Island coast demonstrated last month, an oil spill can have devastating consequences for such marine environments.
But for the organization that protects environmentally sensitive areas of Portland Harbor, the Rhode Island spill also provided a valuable opportunity to evaluate and improve local emergency response plans.
"It really highlighted for us the importance of the work we've been doing, and the need to keep that in focus," said John M. Ferland, general manager of Clean Casco Bay Inc.
Clean Casco Bay's effectiveness in containing a spill could mean the difference between a minor incident and a full-blown disaster that imperils both the environment and the economy of Portland Harbor.
The resources at stake include an abundance of wildlife, a diverse fishery and a commercial port that supports 3,700 jobs, with a $70 million annual payroll.
Ferland's organization is the first line of defense against oil spills in Portland Harbor - an area that includes the Fore River, inner Casco Bay, several islands and other environmentally sensitive areas.
The organization's weapons include a fleet of five specially designed boats and a warehouse stuffed with containment booms, skimmers, absorbent materials and other gear.
In the event of an accident, Clean Casco Bay would call in cleanup workers to deploy equipment, contain the oil and help to recover it from the water - under the direction of the Coast Guard, the state or the responsible shipper.
The organization has trained to respond in lessthan two hours.
To evaluate the effectiveness of their plans, Ferland and the two other staff members at Clean Casco Bay traveled to Rhode Island immediately after last month's spill.
They visited the site where a barge ran aground and dumped 828,000 gallons of heating oil into Block Island Sound. They also studied efforts to protect beaches and other sensitive zones and lingered at the command post where the massive cleanup operation was coordinated.
Ferland said he was especially interested in how authorities coped with stormy weather and adjusted their cleanup strategies to keep the lightweight oil away from birds, shellfish and other wildlife. Fish and animals would be at risk should an oil spill occur near Portland.
"Clearly, we're going to have a wildlife impact up here (if a spill occurs)," he said. "And it's not going to take 800,000 gallons to do it."
Bay's wildlife is bountiful
Casco Bay supports a bountiful array of wildlife and other natural resources that are vulnerable to damage from an oil spill.
The bird population includes more than 60,000 ducks, seabirds and other waterfowl, and marine resources include lobster, soft-shell clams, and a wide variety of fin fish.
Through this rich environment, barges haul a diverse mixture of petroleum products - such as crude oil, diesel fuel, gasoline and asphalt - each packing a particular threat.
Government and private industry have woven a complex network of emergency services in recent years to keep the oil and water apart in Portland Harbor.
Six marine terminal operators fund Ferland's organization, which targets the inner harbor. Another industry funded group, Marine Spill Response Corp., is responsible for open water spills in Casco Bay.
The Coast Guard and state Department of Environmental Protection also have emergency response programs.
Keeping skills sharp
In 1995, the groups conducted three joint exercises to test their system and keep their skills sharp. Coincidental to the Rhode Island spill, the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office ran an exercise in Portland just two weeks ago to test the "integrated command system," which would coordinate the activities of the various emergency response groups in Casco Bay.
Ferland says he will sit down with his two staff associates soon and digest what they observed in Rhode Island.
Eventually, the Coast Guard also will prepare its own analysis of what caused the Rhode Island spill and how well the emergency response worked. That report will be studied closely by cleanup specialists in Portland.
"It stands to reason," Ferland said, "that the Coast Guard is going to learn something from this spill and try to apply it." -------------------------------------------------------------------- -------- FOR LINKS to Internet information on oil spills and Casco Bay, see the Press Herald's World Wide Web site: www.portland.com

Abstract: Surfers from southern Maine and New Hampshire last week created a local chapter of Surfrider Foundation, a national nonprofit group 28,000 strong whose goals are conservation, activism, research and education. Mike Morin, one of the founders, said Maine surfers number in the thousands, and the sport gets more popular by the year. But many Mainers, particularly those in inland towns such as Sanford, where he lives and makes surfboards, don't know this. One needn't be a surfer to join Surfrider Foundation. Morin said the group, which has about 25 founding members, welcomes anyone interested in the ocean. The group can be reached through Morin at 324-3738.

Full text: Count surfers among the people of the coast who are organizing to improve their image, gain political clout and guard the environment.
Surfers from southern Maine and New Hampshire last week created a local chapter of Surfrider Foundation, a national nonprofit group 28,000 strong whose goals are conservation, activism, research and education.
Mike Morin, one of the founders, said Maine surfers number in the thousands, and the sport gets more popular by the year. But many Mainers, particularly those in inland towns such as Sanford, where he lives and makes surfboards, don't know this.
"They don't realize we even exist," said Morin. "I say I make surfboards, and (people) say, `Why? Why?' "
Morin was spurred to organize surfers after police shooed everyone out of the ocean during last summer's storms, which raised waves of 8 to 10 feet.
"We wait our whole life for a season like this," he said.
So one of the group's top goals, Morin said, is to convince authorities that surfers are safe in big swells and that they can work faster than lifeguards to rescue beachwalkers swept out - because they're already in the water.
Other goals of the group are keeping the ocean clean, teaching schoolchildren about the sea and teaching surfing etiquette and techniques to beginners.
One needn't be a surfer to join Surfrider Foundation. Morin said the group, which has about 25 founding members, welcomes anyone interested in the ocean. The group can be reached through Morin at 324-3738.
Former gas tanks now hold Sprague heating oil
The "Getty" sign painted in a swath of red on the oil tank in South Portland is outdated now.
In December, Sprague Energy of Portsmouth, N.H., took over the 11.5-million-gallon tank farm by Veterans Memorial Bridge.
Bob Blanchard, vice president of terminal operations for Sprague, said the tanks that once held gasoline now contain heating oil.
Sprague has been in Searsport and Bucksport for 100 years, Blanchard said, but had not had a terminal in Portland until now. The property still is owned by Getty Petroleum Corp.; Sprague has a lease.
Blanchard said Sprague's name will be painted on the oil tank in the spring.
Lobstering conference rescheduled for March
A gathering of scientists to consider whether New England lobster truly are overfished has been rescheduled for the week of March 25.
A January date for the review was canceled because of the federal government shutdown.
The panel ofcrustacean experts is to consider why lobster landings keep rising even though regional scientists believe the shellfish have been caught for years at unsustainable rates.
The meeting will take place at the Holiday Inn at the Crossings in Warwick, R.I.
Best views of Casco Bay depend on where you sit
From the top of a power plant to the top of a hotel, answers poured in to our query last week: What's the best indoor view of Casco Bay?
These were the public views: The top of the Radisson Sonesta hotel in Portland. The waiting room of Martin's Point Health Care in Portland. Bay Harbor Restaurant in South Portland. McKernan Hospitality Center dining room at Southern Maine Technical College (open for lunch Mondays and Tuesdays by reservation) in South Portland.
Several people told of private views from homes, from the dining room of the Portland Yacht Club in Falmouth, and from the 16th floor of Franklin Towers in Portland. Marie Maiorino of Falmouth Foreside was rhapsodic about her scene of"gorgeous greens and beautiful blues of the water."
The most creative answer came from Dick Meservey, a technician at Central Maine Power, who has views in all directions from the top of a power plant stack on Cousins Island. See inset.
This week's question is: What's the strangest thing you've ever found in Casco Bay or on one of its shores? Answer by calling 800-499-0043, or via Baynet on the Internet, http://www.portland.com
FACES ON THE WATERFRONT
Name: Dick Meservey
Occupation: Power plant technician
Location: Cousins Island
Job description: Meservey has worked for Central Maine Power at the Wyman power plant for 25 years. One of his regular, and especially delightful, assignments is checking the stack emissions monitors, which are housed in an enclosure inside the stack. The concrete stack has 10 windows, giving views in all directions.
Quote: "We can see all the way to Bailey Island, all the way to Two Lights, and on a real clear day, we can see Mount Washington."

ATLANTIC SURF CLAM HAS TASTE TO REMEMBER FOR ITS SEEKERS HOWEVER FIXED, THE EAST COAST'S LARGEST CLAM IS A GIFT TO THE TABLE.

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]04 Feb 1996: 4.C.

Abstract: To find the Atlantic surf clam, say the experts, go to a clean-sand beach two hours after the second high tide. There, the East Coast's largest bivalve will be inhabiting the zone of breaking surf, several inches beneath the surface of the sand. In a major storm, hundreds or thousands may be left on the surface by the churning waters.

Full text: To find the Atlantic surf clam, say the experts, go to a clean-sand beach two hours after the second high tide. There, the East Coast's
largest bivalve will be inhabiting the zone of breaking surf, several inches beneath the surface of the sand. In a major storm, hundreds or thousands may be left on the surface by the churning waters.
Then begins the feast of the herring gulls, which carry the clams aloft and drop them on rocks to break them open.
Not only gulls are attracted to the surf clam's bounty. The huge, tasty clam with the yellowish-white, triangular shell accounts for more than 70 percent of all clams harvested in North America, most dredged off the sandy coast of New Jersey, where it is especially abundant.
It is the clam used in commercial clam chowder; individual clammers either chop the clams finely and prepare them in surf clam cakes, or steam them whole. On Prince Edward Island, at the northern end of its range, it even is pickled.
Called the hen clam in Maine, beach or skimmer clam in the Middle Atlantic states and bar clam in the Maritimes, it has a wonderfully distinctive flavor - the king of shellfish, some regard it; Neptune's gift to gulls and Man.

Abstract: A seven-month effort to determine the best way to limit pollution and crowding in Brunswick's waterways will come to a head at Monday's Town Council meeting. The council is scheduled to choose from two boating ordinances. One would require boaters to register moorings but would let them moor wherever they want. The other, stricter ordinance would give the town's harbor master the power to determine the location of moorings. But the council voted two weeks ago that strict regulation is not necessary. With a 4-4 vote, the council directed the town staff to stop work on an extensive waterways ordinance and instead to write an ordinance that simply requires boater registration.

Full text: A seven-month effort to determine the best way to limit pollution and crowding in Brunswick's waterways will come to a head at Monday's Town Council meeting.
The council is scheduled to choose from two boating ordinances. One would require boaters to register moorings but would let them moor wherever they want. The other, stricter ordinance would give the town's harbor master the power to determine the location of moorings.
Both ordinances would establish a five-member committee that would develop policies for Brunswick's waters.
Whichever ordinance the council chooses will go to a public hearing in a couple of weeks and then will return to the council for a vote.
The town's harbor master and some coastal property owners claim the stricter ordinance is needed to protect Brunswick's waters from increasing boat traffic that is creeping up the coast from the south.
But the council voted two weeks ago that strict regulation is not necessary. With a 4-4 vote, the council directed the town staff to stop work on an extensive waterways ordinance and instead to write an ordinance that simply requires boater registration.
Town Manager Don Gerrish said he is presenting both ordinances to give the council a choice. He said the stricter ordinance is a scaled-down, five-page version of the extensive 18-page waterways ordinance the council said it didn't like.
"I felt looking at all avenues would help them with their decision," said Gerrish.
Stephen McCausland, the council chairman, voted two weeks ago to work only on an ordinance that simply requires registration. But he said Thursday the stricter ordinance has potential.
"I haven't made up my mind yet," McCausland said. "But Don has done a commendable job condensing 18 pages down to five. I think we are making progress."
Development of a waterways ordinance has been underway since July, when the council imposed a moratorium on moorings that is still in place. Coastal property owners prompted the effort by complaining that the waters in front of their land were becoming increasingly crowded with moorings.
Unlike surrounding communities, Brunswick has no local ordinance governing its waterways. During the vote two weeks ago, some councilors argued the town doesn't have to worry about crowding, because there are few areas where moorings would be easily accessible from land. They said an extensive waterways ordinance would be an unnecessary expense.
But Alan Houston, the harbor master, said crowding in waters south of Brunswick will soon come to Brunswick, and pollution from the boats will threaten the shellfish population.
Houston said he hopes the council changes its mind and supports the stricter ordinance.

BARGE SPILL MAY HAVE LURED LOBSTERS TO DEATHS THOUSANDS OF CRUSTACEANS, APPARENTLY ATTRACTED TO THE SMELL OF PETROLEUM, ARE KILLED.

Abstract: So far it looks as if the lobsters were the hardest hit in the North Cape oil spill, and it could be because they were attracted to the smell. Thousands of lobsters, mostly small immature lobsters and juveniles not of legal size, washed ashore in the days following the oil spill off Moonstone Beach. Tom Angell, a state Division of Fish and Wildlife biologists specializing in lobsters, said the smell attracts lobsters for unknown reasons. He said old-time lobstermen used to soak their wooden lobster traps in kerosene because they believed the smell acted as bait.

Full text: So far it looks as if the lobsters were the hardest hit in the North Cape oil spill, and it could be because they were attracted to the smell.
Thousands of lobsters, mostly small immature lobsters and juveniles not of legal size, washed ashore in the days following the oil spill off Moonstone Beach.
A barge dumped 828-thousand gallons of heating oil into the water when it ran aground after the tugboat pulling it caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship.
But the smell of petroleum may have lured lobsters to their deaths rather than having sent them scurrying for safety.
Tom Angell, a state Division of Fish and Wildlife biologists specializing in lobsters, said the smell attracts lobsters for unknown reasons. He said old-time lobstermen used to soak their wooden lobster traps in kerosene because they believed the smell acted as bait.
In any event, the oil spill may have severely hurt the species. At this time there is no way to tell how badly.
First of all, not everything killed washed ashore. There could be many thousands more lobsters that lie dead on the ocean bottom or were consumed by predators.
Lobstermen have not been allowed to pull up the hundreds of traps in the area, but those who did at the request of environmental officials said they found traps loaded with dozens of small, dead lobsters.
Even without the spill, a lobster's chance of surviving to adulthood are slim.
Only 1 percent survive the first stage of life as larvae. A small female produces between 3,000 and 4,000 eggs; a 5-pounder may produce as many as 100,000.
But there are many dangers after birth.
"Just about everything preys on lobster larvae," Angell said. "Including other lobster larvae."
Storms take their toll. So do fin fish, such as cod, haddock, striped bass and tautog among others. Lobsters will stay in holes and cracks between rocks, sucking food from the water, for 3 to 4 years. At that age they begin to move about, preying on smaller fish, worms and algae.
Then comes their greatest predator.
Generally, a lobster is between 6 and 8 years old when it become legal size for lobstermen. By then the female may have mated once or twice. Rarely do adult lobsters escape the trap.
"Between 90 and 95 percent of them are captured," Angell said.
Rhode Island lobstermen land about 6.5 million pounds a year, 45 percent from inshore, the rest offshore. In waters off Massachusetts and Maine the vast majority are captured close to shore.
The spill hit lobsters hard because they lack the filtering system of shellfish, which filter water for food and reject impurities. More than 80 percent of the oil was churned into the deep within three hours of the spill, according to the computer models, suffocating lobsters.

DAMAGE FROM R.I. OIL SPILL CONTINUES TO MOUNT THE CLEANUP PROGRESSES, BUT THE TOLL ON MARINE LIFE IS STAGGERING.

Abstract: The barge that ran aground off the Rhode Island coast and spilled 820,000 gallons of heating oil surrendered most of its remaining cargo in a feverish transfer operation on Tuesday.

Full text: The barge that ran aground off the Rhode Island coast and spilled 820,000 gallons of heating oil surrendered most of its remaining cargo in a feverish transfer operation on Tuesday.
But the environmental damage continued to mount in the fishing villages and tourist towns sprinkled around Block Island Sound.
Authorities expanded a shellfishing ban as more beaches were fouled, lobstermen tallied their losses and the number of dead waterfowl continued to rise.
Either voluntarily or by recruitment, Mainers are being drawn into the drama.
The Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in Portland sent three crew members here Sunday to help with the cleanup. Clean Harbors, a private environmental cleanup firm, dispatched several workers from its office in South Portland.
And an unknown number of volunteers, including three surfers from York County, simply came on their own, offering to do whatever they could in a disaster that has sent shivers up and down the New England coast.
Mike Morin, Chris Brown and Brett Chick belong to the Surfriders Foundation, an environmentally oriented surfing association with chapters across the country.
Morin said the three drove here from Maine early Tuesday because they are familiar with Matunuck Beach, a popular surfing spot that took a heavy hit from the spill.
"We came to see what we could do," Morin said. "We're not against getting our hands dirty today."
Authorities said more than 400 people like the three Maine surfers had volunteered for the cleanup operation. Their efforts were coordinated by Save the Bay, an environmental group from Providence, R.I.
Most of the Mainers on hand said the disaster strikes uncomfortably close to home.
"You walk along the beach and find a bunch of dead lobsters and it really sinks in," said Chief Petty Officer Jim Couture of the Marine Safety Office in Portland. "You realize it could happen in your own back yard."
The barge North Cape ran aground here Friday after a fire broke out on the tug that was towing it, and the tug's crew abandoned ship. Of the 3.9 million gallons of oil on the unmanned barge, at least 820,000 gallons spilled into the sound.
Heavy seas and high winds have hampered efforts to offload the remaining oil, but by Tuesday evening salvage workers had transferred most of it to other vessels.
Coast Guard Capt. Barney Turlo, captain of the Port of Providence, said salvage work probably would be suspended today because of anticipated high winds and seas of 8 to 12 feet.
"Every fourth or fifth wave is crashing over the deck of the barge now," he said.
Southerly winds Tuesday pushed tendrils of floating oil toward the shore, a sandy zone etched with a series of irregular inlets known locally as "salt ponds." The ponds offer an important spawning and nursery ground for fin fish and shellfish. And many had been protected by absorbent booms strung by emergency workers.
But the booming operation failed to protect the Point Judith Harbor of Refuge, where the local fishing fleet ties up in the village of Galilee.
There, Robert Mitchell, co-owner of Chamblin's Seafood, stood forlornly on the dock Tuesday afternoon and eyed the rainbow of color - oil on water - glistening at his feet.
The contaminated water was being pushed into his shed, where 20,000 pounds of lobster were alive but under an embargo imposed by state environmental officials, to protect public health.
"If I lose my lobster," Mitchell said, "I lose 70 percent of my business."
Up and down the Galilee waterfront, which is lined with seafood shacks, diners and warehouses, the story was much the same for Mitchell's fellow fishermen.
All told, the state has embargoed 43,000 pounds of lobster due to oil contamination. The shellfishing ban was extended Tuesday when more contamination was found east of Point Judith at the mouth of Narragansett Bay.
Dead surf clams, a staple of the fishing trade in these parts, littered sections of Matunuck Point, a popular swimming and surfing spot also near Point Judith.
At night, Couture, the marine safety officer from Portland, patrols the beaches with two others from Maine, Petty Officers John Betts and Scott Young.
Cruising in a four-wheel-drive truck fitted with a searchlight, they check the booms that have been strung to protect the inland salt ponds, and look for injured birds and other wildlife.
Monday night, as thick fog drifted off the sound, their searchlight illuminated a 70-foot stretch of beach littered with dead lobsters - some up to 10 inches long.
"It was pretty surreal," Couture said.
Shellfish aren't the only animals suffering from the spill. By Tuesday afternoon, 197 birds had been fouled with oil and 108 were dead. Volunteers were working desperately to save the birds in an emergency rescue operation housed in the town of Narragansett's public works garage.
Inside the building, volunteers wearing rubber gloves and white plastic jumpsuits gently washed the birds in Dawn detergent and rinsed them in warm, clear water to remove the soapy residue.
Behind a blue vinyl tarpaulin, the birds were held in a makeshift recovery area where playpens were covered with sheets and warmed with infrared lamps.
Chris Hileland, a Delaware volunteer with Tri-State Bird Rescue, said this is one of the more serious of the 10 oil spills he has worked.
"We're getting a lot of loons," he said. "And they're a bird that doesn't do well when you get them out of the water.They're not equipped to be on land."
In the villages up and down the Rhode Island coast, residents watched the cleanup with resignation and - as the oil transfer operation made headway Tuesday - some degree of hope.
Francis J. Browning, owner of the Larchwood Inn in Wakefield, not far from the spill site, said business owners who cater to tourists were grateful that the spill occurred in the winter.
Ann O'Neill, president of the South County Tourism Council, said scientists from the Universityof Rhode Island assured her there would be no evidence of the spill by Memorial Day.
"Because of the quality of life and our rural, pristine setting, tourism affects a good 80 percent of our economy," she said.
The prospects for rapid recovery elsewhere in the economy are uncertain. Mitchell, the lobster dealer from Point Judith, said his son hauled lobster traps Tuesday morning and found 40 to 50 lobsters in each trap. All juveniles. All dead.
"I'm sure we'll get paid for our losses now," he said. "The trouble is going to come down the line." MAINE SPILLS
The largest oil spill in Maine history happened on Nov. 25, 1963. The Northern Gulf, a Liberian supertanker, went aground off West Cod Ledge near Cape Elizabeth, pouring more than 1 million gallons of crude oil into the sea.
The most recent major spill in Maine happened on July 22, 1972. The MV Tamano, a Norwegian tanker, scraped Soldier's Ledge in Hussey Sound, developing a gash that leaked 100,000 gallons of fuel oil intoCasco Bay.
U.S. Coast Guard records show that in 1994, accidents in Maine and New Hampshire spilled 5,633 gallons of petroleum products into coastal waters. Annual figures from 1995 were unavailable.

Abstract: So far, an estimated 11,000 lobsters and dozens of sea birds were coated with oil, with 50 birds and countless lobsters washing ashore dead. The nearby Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge contains an estimated 75,000 sea birds, and is a popular wintering spot for the rare harlequin duck. Many such Arctic species winter over along the New England coast.

Full text: The 828,000 gallons of No. 2 heating oil leaking from a grounded barge on the southern coast of Rhode Island is a damaging reminder that no amount of caution is too much when dealing with oil.
So far, an estimated 11,000 lobsters and dozens of sea birds were coated with oil, with 50 birds and countless lobsters washing ashore dead. The nearby Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge contains an estimated 75,000 sea birds, and is a popular wintering spot for the rare harlequin duck. Many such Arctic species winter over along the New England coast.
The vessel was blown ashore by 60-mph winds in last Friday's storm. A plume of oil has reached as far as Block Island, but offshore wind and currents have prevented the oil from coating the shoreline. It was also fortunate that the oil was the lighter fuel oil rather than heavy crude, which would stay in the water for months, befouling sea life for as long as it lasted.
Nevertheless, this is a highly serious accident. Why was such an unwieldy vessel at sea in a storm with near-hurricane force winds and 15-foot waves?
Barge companies should stay in port when threatening weather looms, and operators should be fully qualified and knowledgeable about local waters. Birds and shellfish are paying a high price for this accident. Next time, the price could be much higher.

Abstract: Only one of the nine groups has turned in its petitions. A group that seeks campaign finance reform has collected 62,000 signatures, according to Chip Gavin of the Secretary of State's Office. The reforms would include public financing for gubernatorial and legislative candidates who agree to abide by voluntary spending limits.

Full text: If everyone who's been gathering signatures hits the magic target of 51,131 names before Jan. 29, voters may have to wade through the longest referendum ballot in recent history this fall.
Citizen groups have been pushing nine different causes they hope will win a spot on the November election ballot.
Only one of the nine groups has turned in its petitions. A group that seeks campaign finance reform has collected 62,000 signatures, according to Chip Gavin of the Secretary of State's Office. The reforms would include public financing for gubernatorial and legislative candidates who agree to abide by voluntary spending limits.
Gavin said te other questions include:
A proposal to cap local property taxes at 1 percent of assessed valuations.
A proposal to legalize marijuana.
A proposal to allow doctor-assisted suicide.
A proposal to ban clearcutting.
A proposal to require the state to pay 100 percent of the cost of local education, ending the reliance of local schools on local property taxes.
A proposal to replace optional local shellfish licenses with a single state shellfish license.
A proposal to require all candidates and elected officials to show support for congressional term limits or have their refusal to do so printed on the ballot.
A proposal to prohibit the federal government from mandating the use of any fuel in Maine, including reformulated gas, or ordering emission testing without legislative and voter approval.

SEAMAN'S CLUB: SERVING SEAFOOD RIGHT WAY IN RIGHT PLACE

Publication info: Portland Press Herald ; Portland, Me. [Portland, Me]21 Jan 1996: 2.E.

Abstract: Among the Old Port restaurants that have become institutions because of their longevity and consistency, the Seaman's Club comes to mind. It is located in a building that marks the corner of Fore and Exchange streets, a building that was put up just after the Great Portland Fire of 1866. At times during its history, it housed an actual seaman's club, a gathering spot for seamen on the beach of simply waiting for their ships to load. As a restaurant, the Seaman's Club offers the atmosphere of an old-fashioned, awkwardly reached, upstairs dining room, with not-quite-even floors, exposed brickwork and beams, and a view down narrow cobbled streets to the harbor. It feels quaint, historic and comfortable. Eleven of the 15 menu choices are seafood, though chicken, steak and one vegetarian entree are offered. Haddock, sole, shrimp, swordfish, scallops, crab cakes, lobster in three preparations, and fried clams, shrimp or fish are the backbone of the menu. On our night a special of trout stuffed with smoked salmon and spinach was offered as well.

Among the Old Port restaurants that have become institutions because of their longevity and consistency, the Seaman's Club comes to mind. It is located in a building that marks the corner of Fore and Exchange streets, a building that was put up just after the Great Portland Fire of 1866. At times during its history, it housed an actual seaman's club, a gathering spot for seamen on the beach of simply waiting for their ships to load.
As a restaurant, the Seaman's Club offers the atmosphere of an old-fashioned, awkwardly reached, upstairs dining room, with not-quite-even floors, exposed brickwork and beams, and a view down narrow cobbled streets to the harbor. It feels quaint, historic and comfortable.
One enters on the street level, where there is a bar and a lounge, and makes a way up to the dining area. We visited on a recent weekend night and found the dining room occupied, though not full. We were served by a staff of waiters who were friendly and correct without being overbearing. We occupied a window table and enjoyed the view of snowy Portland.
Eleven of the 15 menu choices are seafood, though chicken, steak and one vegetarian entree are offered. Haddock, sole, shrimp, swordfish, scallops, crab cakes, lobster in three preparations, and fried clams, shrimp or fish are the backbone of the menu. On our night a special of trout stuffed with smoked salmon and spinach was offered as well.
Almost all preparations are either sauteed or baked; saucing is either traditional New England - haddock lightly breaded, jumbo shrimp baked with crabmeat stuffing; or drawn from European sources - a quasi-Provencal scallop saute, a lobster bouillabaisse. The kitchen reserves its own creativity for the nightly specials.
The menu lists The Oyster Bar, Soups and Stews, Appetizers, and Salads before it comes to the Entrees. Prices among the initial choices are about average, running from the $2-$3 range for small salads and soups, through $5-$7 for fresh oysters, Caesar salad and smoked trout, on up to $9-$11 for a sampler of smoked seafood and a Casco Bay Seafood Salad.
The restaurant's wine list offers some interesting wines. As one might expect, the list is heavy with chardonnays, these being the wine-with-seafood of the moment. We drank a pleasant Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay, '94 ($23) with our meal.
We made a policy decision to stick entirely with seafood for our meal, so we began with Fish Chowder ($2.95-$3.95) and the Smoked Seafood Sampler ($8.95). Gratifyingly, the first of these was of the thin - the real - chowder style, with large chunks of potato and fish.
The sampler consisted of adequate offerings of smoked salmon, trout, scallops, mussels and Maine shrimp. Seafood lends itself to smoking, and its variety of texture, natural flavor, fats and oils means that the same smoke applied to varying seafood will provide a variety of flavor results. The shrimp, mussels and salmon had particularly good results. The presentation would have been enhanced by a few capers and minced red onion.
For entrees, we selected the Grilled Fresh Swordfish ($13.95), prepared as a special of the day, and the Jumbo Lobster Bouillabaisse ($18.95). The swordfish preparation involved a sauce of sun-dried tomatoes and garlic, which was rendered skillfully, deeply enough reduced to meld the flavors and to smooth the sometimes too acidic tomato. A light dressing of the sauce on the very fresh and juicy swordfish steak proved to be a tasty combination.
The Seaman's Club version of bouillabaisse is served all in one dish (as is the American way) and is heavy on the tomato, light on the onions, showcases the saffron but passes lightly over the orange peel and pepper. The bread, cheese and the rouille are not represented. Half a lobster sliced longways in the shell is laid across the top. The dish was satisfying.
For desserts, we enjoyed the "BIP," the restaurant's self-proclaimed traditional and classic baked Indian pudding ($2.95); and the mousse-of-the-day ($3.95), chocolate.
We'd return to The Seaman's Club for its downtown ambiance (for a harbor town) and for the traditional preparations of fresh seafood. It's solid and dependable.

Abstract: Despite warnings that increased boating threatens to pollute Brunswick waterways, the Town Council on Tuesday scaled back a proposal that would have restricted their use. The council also postponed action on an effort to allow a horse-drawn carriage service to operate in the downtown area. The council set a public hearing for Feb. 5 to hear residents' views on the issue. Development of a waterways ordinance has been under way since July, when the council imposed a moratorium on moorings. Coastal property owners prompted the effort by complaining that the waters in front of their land were becoming increasingly crowded with moorings.

Full text: Despite warnings that increased boating threatens to pollute Brunswick waterways, the Town Council on Tuesday scaled back a proposal that would have restricted their use.
The council also postponed action on an effort to allow a horse-drawn carriage service to operate in the downtown area. The council set a public hearing for Feb. 5 to hear residents' views on the issue.
Development of a waterways ordinance has been under way since July, when the council imposed a moratorium on moorings. Coastal property owners prompted the effort by complaining that the waters in front of their land were becoming increasingly crowded with moorings.
But instead of limiting the number of moorings and where theycan be placed, councilors said the town should only require that boaters register with the town before setting a mooring.
The council extended the mooring moratorium 50 days to give town officials time to develop the registration ordinance.
Councilors said a predicted boom in moorings is exaggerated and that development of an extensive waterways ordinance would be an unnecessary expense.
Councilor David Gleason said boaters won't rush to place moorings in Brunswick's waters, because there are few areas where the moorings would be easily accessible from land.
"I just don't see the monster hiding behind the corner," Gleason said. "Our waterways protect themselves."
Unlike surrounding communities, Brunswick has no local ordinance governing its waterways. Alan Houston, the town's harbormaster, told the council that he expects more boats to start using Brunswick's waters and that pollution from the boats will threaten the shellfish population.
By scaling back the proposed waterways ordinance, Houston said, the council runs the risk of permitting boating in the area to "max out" Brunswick's waters.
Councilor Robert Galloupe agreed with Houston.
"We've gotten to the point that if we don't do anything there will be boats going all over the place," Galloupe said. "The moorings will be as thick as lobster traps."
The plan to permit horse-drawn carriages was prompted by a Bob Robshaw, a Brunswick man who wrote to the town asking permission to operate a carriage service based on Park Row.
Robshaw said he has acquired four carriages and three horses and would like to start the service in April.
"I'm not sure there will be enough interest to do it full-time, but I'll have fun doing it," Robshaw said.
Robshaw wants to give tours that would run past the Joshua L. Chamberlain Museum on Maine Street, through Bowdoin College, and by the old homes along Federal and School streets. He has also proposed tours of the countryside.
The council will vote on the necessary amendments to town ordinances after the Feb. 5 hearing.

FISHING ACCIDENTS CLAIMED TWO LIVES IN MAINE IN 1995

Abstract: Two Mainers died in commercial fishing accidents in 1995. Statistically, that's worse than the year before, but nowhere near as bad as two years ago. A third Maine fisherman, Whitfield Steele, 25, disappeared with his girlfriend while boating on Casco Bay on Dec. 26. The incident is not considered an industry fatality because Steele was not fishing during the outing. "In the morning, you go out in the blind and you'd do a tern feeding study for four hours, and then you'd come back and have your lunch, and that's when I'd sit in the blind on the roof of the cabin and watch small boats (visiting) for an hour, and then in the afternoon I would go back out in a blind and watch puffins for three hours, and then I would come back and watch the (commercial tour boat) for an hour and a half, and then we'd make dinner and go to bed."

Full text: Two Mainers died in commercial fishing accidents in 1995. Statistically, that's worse than the year before, but nowhere near as bad as two years ago.
The people who lost their lives in the past year were:
Gerald Moody, 33, of Machiasport, who was crushed to death March 7 when a scallop drag weighing perhaps a ton fell from its steel cable rigging.
Roy Hutchins, 36, of Milbridge, who was lobstering alone on Sept. 9 when he drowned, apparently after falling overboard.
In addition, a New Hampshire urchin harvester, Eric Willinbrock, 35, died Jan. 23 of a heart attack while diving.
A third Maine fisherman, Whitfield Steele, 25, disappeared with his girlfriend while boating on Casco Bay on Dec. 26. The incident is not considered an industry fatality because Steele was not fishing during the outing.
Commercial fishing is considered one of the most dangerous careers in the United States, although firm statistics are hard to come by. The Coast Guard began only in 1993 to track all industry deaths.
That year in Maine, seven fishermen died on the job. In 1994, one person died.
Puffin researcher logs long hours on the job
The thousands of people each summer who visit Maine islands to see puffins might think it a great job to live among the adorable squat creatures.
But the glamour dims a bit when you consider this schedule kept for 2 1/2 months by Tammy Jackson, a University of Maine student who studied seabirds on Eastern Egg Rock this summer:
"In the morning, you go out in the blind and you'd do a tern feeding study for four hours, and then you'd come back and have your lunch, and that's when I'd sit in the blind on the roof of the cabin and watch small boats (visiting) for an hour, and then in the afternoon I would go back out in a blind and watch puffins for three hours, and then I would come back and watch the (commercial tour boat) for an hour and a half, and then we'd make dinner and go to bed."
Jackson was an intern for Project Puffin, a seabird restoration project by the National Audubon Society. She also researched an independent study on the effects of ecotourism on nesting puffins.
Did the puffins continue to loaf on the rocks, as is natural, when boats neared? Did they continue to touch bills, a sort of courtship kiss?
Or did the puffins act disturbed, bobbing their heads and bills in the water, or landing in water when they normally would have landed by their burrows?

Malcolm Ray bought a $100 raffle ticket and won a trip worth $2,000 to fish for salmon on an exclusive river in Scotland.
Ray, who lives in Damariscotta, will go in June to the Tay River. He expects the fishing to be considerably better than in Maine, where salmon in seven rivers once rich with spawners may end up on the national list of officially threatened species. The troubled rivers include the Sheepscot, where, Ray said, you can fish for four or five years and not catch a thing.
Ray was one of seven winners out of 676 contestants in the "Raffle of Rivers" put on by the conservation group Atlantic Salmon Federation. Other winners will go to Norway, Iceland, Russia and Canada.
Government shutdown cancels lobster conference
A casualty of the federal government shutdown, ameeting of lobster experts in Rhode Island will not take place this week, after all.
The independent shellfish specialists were supposed to review information on New England's prized crustacean to figure out why lobstermen keep catching more each year even though regional scientists believe lobsters are overfished.
The meeting might be rescheduled when the federal government turmoil ends.
FACES ON THE WATERFRONT
Name: Tammy Robinson
Occupation: Deli manager, Casco Variety
Location: Portland
Job description: The "variety" in this store's name easily could refer to the people who stop in regularly - a mixture of office workers, dock workers, lawyers and fishermen who populate Portland Harbor. It's a scene Robinson has come to know well, because she's worked for 15 years in different establishments on the waterfront. Since 1993, she's run the lunch counter at Casco Variety, where she's learned much about people's particular tastes.
Quote: "When you're making their sandwiches, you get to chat with them - about what they like, who doesn't like onions, who doesn't like green peppers."

Full text: Against the burning blue of Casco Bay, it is a spectacular sight: coal-black body; white head patches; orange, black and white patterned bill - no other bird on sea or land is appareled like the surf scoter.
As its name implies, it frequents the breaking rollers along sandy beaches, where it dives for the mollusks and crustaceans on which it feeds. Often, too, it rests and feeds inside coastal bays; a small flock sometimes is seen by the Peaks Island ferry landing.
Nesting from James Bay to Labrador, the surf scoter heads south in mid-September to spend its winters in coastal waters from the Atlantic Provinces to northern Florida. By mid-May, the return flights are at their height, and the cycle of scoters is begun again.
The surf scoter is the only one of the three scoters that is exclusively a New World species. More reason for Maine to savor this colorful visitor to breaking surf and winter seas.

Full text: About a dozen clammers and town officials gathered around a table Thursday night to scour two 200-year-old maps of Brunswick. What they saw could cause a heated dispute between the neighboring communities.
The maps did not contain three islands that today are recognized as Brunswick's and are off limits to Harpswell clammers.
After looking at the maps, Harpswell's selectmen said they plan to consult an attorney about challenging Brunswick over the location of the town line that separates the two communities.
"All we're trying to determine is if the land is rightfully ours," said Robert Webber, chairman of the Board of Selectmen. "We owe it to our taxpayers and our clam diggers not to give up anything."
The islands are the two Coombs islands in New Meadows River, totaling about 23 acres, and two-acre Crow Island in Merepoint Bay. Bruce Martinson, a land surveyor, said he believes the islands are Harpswell's.
Harpswell's selectmen hired Martinson a few months ago to perform a historical analysis of the town line after a group of Harpswell citizens found information in old law books showing the town line might not be accurate.
The citizens group said there may be a few hundred acres of clam flats recognized as Brunswick's that might actually be Harpswell's. Martinson said he thinks the islands are the only pieces of land Harpswell can dispute, but he said they are enough to create a conflict.
"I'd like to see the communities not get in a big row about it," Martinson said. "But with the value of the Coombs islands and the clam flats around Crow, it's a situation."
Brunswick town officials have said they believe the current town line is accurate and that they do not want to give up any land to Harpswell.
Webber said selectmen will meet with an attorney today and then try to arrange a meeting with Brunswick officials to settle the matter.
The town line issue first surfaced in the spring of 1994, when Harpswell pulled out of a 20-year-old shellfishing agreement with Brunswick and West Bath. Under the agreement, the precise location of the town line wasn't critical because clam flats in all the towns were open to clammers in all the towns.
With the agreement dissolved, only Harpswell clammers can dig on Harpswell's flats. The towns want to place precise markers on the clam flats to determine where clammers from each town can dig.
Originally, Harpswell agreed that the town line should stay where it is. But when the citizens group came forward with the historical evidence, Harpswell's selectmen decided to investigate.
Besides not showing up on the old maps, Martinson said, the islands are not mentioned in the description of Brunswick used for the town's incorporation in 1739.
Skip Purinton, a clammer from Harpswell, said Harpswell can't ignore the historical evidence.
"I don't want to get something that doesn't belong to us," he said. "But I also don't want to give up something that is ours."
He said he hopes the communities can solve the issue amicably. But, he added, "It looks like a lot for Brunswick to lose without a bit of a scuffle." "All we're trying to determine is if the land is rightfully ours." Robert Webber, chairman of the Harpswell selectmen

Full text:   A town line dispute between Harpswell and Brunswick is on the verge of erupting. At stake are about 700 acres of prime clam flats.
Harpswell officials said Tuesday that there's a good chance the town line has not been accurate for decades. They said land deeds dating back more than 200 years seem to show that clam flats recognized as Brunswick's might actually be Harpswell's.
Harpswell's selectmen on Thursday will hear a report on the issue from a land surveyor and then decide whether to challenge Brunswick on the matter.
"They may have been infringing on us for 40 years," said Robert Webber, a Harpswell selectman. "This could be quite a problem."
The meeting starts at6 p.m. at the Harpswell Town Office.
Brunswick officials said the town line is accurate, and the disputed clam flats should remain in Brunswick.
"There's no way in hell they're ever going to get them," said James MacLeod, a clammer for 40 years and the chairman of Brunswick's Marine Resource Committee. "They're trying to make a land grab on us."
The boundary in question is a 10-mile section running from Mere Point to the New Meadows River. Current maps show the line running a few hundred yards off shore in critical clamming areas such as Merepoint Bay and Middle Bay, placing the clam flats in Brunswick.
But some people in Harpswell say that historical documents contradict the maps. The documents place the town line along the shore, they say, shifting the flats into Harpswell.
Dirigo Land Service Inc. of Topsham has been analyzing the town line's history for a couple of months. The firm presented some information to Harpswell's selectmen last Thursday and will conclude its presentationthis Thursday.
The town line issue surfaced in the spring of 1994 when Harpswell withdrew from a 20-year-old shellfishing agreement with Brunswick and West Bath. Under the agreement the line's precise location wasn't critical because clam flats in all the towns were open to clammers from all the towns.
With the agreement dissolved, only Harpswell clammers can dig in Harpswell's flats. The towns want to put precise markers on the clam flats to determine where clammers from each town can dig.
Originally Harpswell agreed that the town line should stay where it is. But Harpswell's selectmen decided to investigate the matter a few months ago when a group of Harpswell citizens reported it had found information in old law books showing the town line is not accurate.
Harpswell Selectman Ron Johnson said that so far the information presented by Dirigo Land Service corroborates the information gathered by the citizens' group.
He said the selectmen on Thursday will probably decide what action to take and then try to schedule a meeting with Brunswick officials to discuss the matter.
He said there's a good chance the issue will end up in court.
"I have a feeling it will be a couple of years before it's resolved," Johnson said. "I'd like to think we could resolve it amicably so that we don't go to court and end up with hard feelings, but that remains to be seen."
Donald Gerrish, Brunswick's town manager, said he also hopes the issue can be resolved amicably. But he said he believes the current town line is accurate and that moving the line would be "a major issue."
"I think we'll stand up for what we think is right, and they'll stand up for what they think is right," he said. "There's no way in hell they're ever going to get them. They're trying to make a land grab on us." James MacLeod, Brunswick clammer

Full text: BIDDEFORD - All William Durkin wanted to do was deliver a present to his daughter's first-grade teacher at St. James School.
His daughter, Catherine, 7, was home sick, and it was up to him to walk the gift to school. But the six-block mission from his downtown Washington Street travel agency to the Graham Street school was tougher than expected.
"I'm not a Scrooge, but the sidewalks are pathetic," said Durkin. "They haven't been shoveled in days. Ihad to walk in the street the whole way."
Durkin, who grew up in Philadelphia, went on to give an "in my day" speech about how as a kid he sought out places to shovel for $5 a pop.
"Houses, businesses, even at the school, nobody is shoveling," said Durkin. "I know it's hard to keep up, but find a kid to do it."
Sanford couple not kids, but they still do it, free
SANFORD - Doris and Merle Chadbourne were shoveling the walk and sweeping the steps of the First Baptist Church on Thursday.
The Chadbournes were married in the stately 1888 church 49 years ago. Ever since, the couple has volunteered to clean up around the old place. On Thursday, that meant shoveling a whole lot of snow.
"We could be sitting at home worrying about this pain or that pain, but that's not for us," Doris Chadbourne, 72, said, taking a break inside the handsome hall.
When greens are white, Green gets out his clubs
SACO - Fore!
Norman Green of Portland has been shouting that quite often lately, despite the region's blanket of snow.
Green has played 13 times at the Biddeford-Saco Country Club (with an orange ball) since it first snowed. Whenever it snows, "He calls and says, `How many inches do we have? We can play in the snow,' " said Nancy DeFrancesco, club manager.
For the less hearty, the club offers card games - inside, of course.
One tree not enough for retirement home
Inside Northview Green, a retirement home in Portland, the most popular place to be Thursday was nearthe 6-foot Christmas tree that Larry Fitzgerald, a resident, put up earlier this week.
After erecting the tree, Fitzgerald tried a gimmick to make his fellow residents feel included. He put a box of ornaments next to the tree with a sign that read: "Hang one of these balls and - presto! - the tree is yours as well."
The sign worked - almost too well. Fitzgerald had to refill his box with other ornaments, many of which were donated by residents, more than half a dozen times.
"The tree is overloaded," Fitzgerald said with a laugh Thursday evening. "At some parts, lower in the tree, the balls bump into each other jostling for space."
Tide and happy hour wait for no man or lawyer
Sometimes there is no defense against Mother Nature.
During the storm Wednesday and Thursday mornings, abnormally high tides surrounded the Portland offices of Daniel G. Lilley, a well-known defense attorney, with sea water.
There was no damage to the offices, which Lilley said have been surrounded bywater in the past.
Lilley joked that he keeps an inflatable rowboat in the office at 39 Portland Pier for just such an occasion. "We were able to blow it up and row over to J's Oyster Bar for cocktails," Lilley said. "Fortunately, we got there for the tail end of happy hour."
January `white' sale comes in December
One of the busiest places in Portland over the past few days has been Don's Power Equipment on Riverside Street, which sells and services snowblowers.
"It's been crazy," said Dan Waite, a salesman at Don's. "Fifty percent want new snowblowers, and the other 50 percent want theirs repaired right there on the spot.
"We've sold nearly a season's supply of snowblowers in 2 1/2 weeks - so many we've lost count," said Waite.
Waite reports that Don's has already sold out of several models of snowblowers. "This is January-type stuff going on here."
Man's got two vehicles, but no garage for them
John Veilleux learned what it's like Thursday not to have four-wheel drive on his Izuzu Trooper. Just home from work, he got out the shovel and started digging for his parking space.
"Before my four-wheel drive blew out, I could mow over snowbanks," he said. Now he's got to dig. "I don't mind so much. It's good exercise."
However, Veilleux's not waiting to fix his car. "I'm working on the four-wheel drive this weekend," he said after 10 minutes of shoveling.
Idle shrimp fishermen may finally decorate
Shrimp boats covered with snow sat idle for the second consecutive day along Portland's waterfront.
"It's not the snow. It's the seas that mess us up," said Joe Donovan, plant manager at Cozy Harbor Seafood.
Inside the plant, Donovan asked some workers to go home and come back tomorrow.
No shrimp, he said. "There's not too much work." If fishermen couldn't go out on the water today, he said, shrimp processors "will put up Christmas decorations."
White Christmas perfect for an early birthday
Gliding down deserted streets, NadiaGlucksberg and Steve Hamill took an evening tour of Christmas decorations in the West End - on skis.
"Do we seem crazy to be out here?" they asked. "Noooo, it's great."
The cross-country skis were an early birthday present from Nadia to Steve.
"If it hadn't snowed, he wouldn't have gotten them now," Nadia explained. "I just wanted someone to play with."

IS THE WHOLE STATE OUT THERE WRITING MAINE COOKBOOKS? WHETHER IT'S DOWNEAST EATS OR A SPECIALTY BOOK BY SOMEONE WHO LIVES HERE, THERE'S A POTENTIAL HOLIDAY GIFT SITTING ON THE SHELVES.

Abstract: "Maine Ingredients" (published by the Junior League of Portland, $18.95) logs in with the most recipes - 342. It is part of wave of more sophisticated Junior League cookbooks that are popping up around the country. The book emphasizes the state's homegrown ingredients, and updates standard recipes. The standard crab cakes have morphed into scallop and shrimp cakes. Boiled lobster is eschewed for a grilled lobster basted with a lemon-basil butter sauce. Nary a can of cream of mushroom soup can be found here. For a guide to old-style Maine cookery turn to "Cooking Down East" by Marjorie Standish (Down EastBooks, $14.95). Written in 1969 and reissued this year, this book is packed with traditional recipes, such as salt cod dinner, red flannel hash and clam cakes. The dishes are ultrasimple, reflecting the limited availability of fresh ingredients. The 195 recipes in "Good Old Fashioned Maine Cookery" (Prima Publishing, $14.95) is a cross between old and new. The book includes how-tos for many Down East comfort foods (red flannel hash, lobster stew, New England boiled dinner) as well as recipes from away, ones the Down East authors Terry Rohe and Sally Cohen inherited from friends and family.

Full text: Before you reach for "Cooking with Friends," that crass crossbreeding of cuisine and TV's hit comedy about a group of twentysomethings and their haircuts, scan the bookstores' regional cookbook shelves for Christmas present ideas.
Plenty of cookbooks are written by Maine authors and/or cover the regional cuisine that makes this state popular with foodies. Most of these books do not have the glossy covers or color photographs of their big publishing house cousins, but you'll find plenty of good recipes, especially for Maine's bounty of seafood.
Two of my favorite cookbooks from this year's crop are Elinor Klivans' "Bake and Freeze Desserts" (William Morrow and Co., Inc., $25) and Mark Hodesh's "Recipes from a Down East Inn" (Country Roads Press, $12.95).
"Bake and Freeze Desserts" was inspired by Klivans' work as a pastry chef at Peter Ott's restaurant in Camden. This is a great book for a do-ahead type cook, but also makes sense for anyone trying to squeeze baking into a busy schedule.
Klivans explains how to freeze everything from whole cakes to lemon curd, as well as offers good tips on baking. It's also a great dessert cookbook, with 130 recipes. I can vouch for the richness of her Deep Dark Chocolate Cake, a great birthday cake, and her Espresso Brownies.
Hodesh owns and runs the Castine Inn with his wife, the artist Margaret Parker, and business partner, Katherine Gould, who both also worked on the cookbook. This slim, softcover book contains recipes Hodesh has created for the inn. These dishes are hearty and simple, but with an extra flair - a sophisticated home cooking.
Hodesh surrounds his crab cakes with mustard sauce, adds leeks and tarragon to his chicken pot pie and dobs apricot sauce on tapioca pudding. The recipes are accompanied by a seasonal account of the inn, which makes for good reading while waiting for something in the oven.
"Maine Ingredients" (published by the Junior League of Portland, $18.95) logs in with the most recipes - 342. It is part of wave of more sophisticated Junior League cookbooks that are popping up around the country. The book emphasizes the state's homegrown ingredients, and updates standard recipes. The standard crab cakes have morphed into scallop and shrimp cakes. Boiled lobster is eschewed for a grilled lobster basted with a lemon-basil butter sauce. Nary a can of cream of mushroom soup can be found here.
For a guide to old-style Maine cookery turn to "Cooking Down East" by Marjorie Standish (Down EastBooks, $14.95). Written in 1969 and reissued this year, this book is packed with traditional recipes, such as salt cod dinner, red flannel hash and clam cakes. The dishes are ultrasimple, reflecting the limited availability of fresh ingredients.
Standish, a long-time food columnist for the Maine Sunday Telegram, offers plenty of tips for preparing the dishes. (Her instructions on how to split a live lobster would give Mary Tyler Moore fits.) This book, especially the seafood section, would make a good starting point for anyone who wants to try updating these traditional dishes on their own.
Sandra Oliver, a food historian in Islesboro, offers 200 authentic Yankee dishes along with the history behind them in "Saltwater Foodway: New Englanders and their Food, at Sea and Ashore, in the Nineteenth century" (Mystic Seaport, $39.95). This is a must for any cook with a historical bent or who is serious about learning the region's cookery.
The 195 recipes in "Good Old Fashioned Maine Cookery" (Prima Publishing, $14.95) is a cross between old and new. The book includes how-tos for many Down East comfort foods (red flannel hash, lobster stew, New England boiled dinner) as well as recipes from away, ones the Down East authors Terry Rohe and Sally Cohen inherited from friends and family.
Mussels on their own
"The Great Eastern Mussel Cookbook" (Paul S. Erikson, $14.95) tells you all you'll ever need to know about this humble, tasty bivalve. To steal one of the book's best lines, the mussel was once the Rodney Dangerfield of the seafood world. It got no respect in America, although Europeans have longed prized them. In recent years, though, the mollusk has gone from the bait bag to the gourmet's table.
Written by Cindy McIntyre and Terrence Callery, who both work at St. George's Great Eastern Mussel Farm, this book contains more information on the mussel than you'll ever need. Skip over the chapter on aquaculture to the imaginative recipes: Thai style red curried mussels, saffron mussel soup, mussel quiche, mussel putanesca pizza sauce. A wine recommendation accompanies each recipe.
"Coastal New England Winterfare and Holiday Cooking" (Coastal New England Publishers, $11.95) by Sherri Eldridge, and "Eat Well and Live Cookbook" (self-published, $9.95) by Rosanne Curto Dauphinee, are aimed at cooks watching their fat consumption.
The recipes in "Coastal New England" have been adapted to meet the dietary guidelines of the American Heart Association. Despite the limitation on fat, the recipes are imaginative (Fettucine Alfredo with Baby Peas and Blackened Scallops for one example) and emphasize using fresh food.
"Eat Well and Live Cookbook" has a lot of helpful information on how to reduce fat in a diet, but the recipes often include prepared foods.
HERE ARE RECIPES from three of the cookbooks that specialize in the cuisine of the region:
Buttermilk Pinneapple
Muffins
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons double-acting baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
pinch of salt
2 tablespoons sugar
1 cup lowfat buttermilk
1 egg, beaten
1/4 cup skim milk
3 tablespoons canola oil
1/2 cup crushed pineapple,

Briefly stir both mixtures together, adding pineable at the same time. Batter will be lumpy. Spoon into muffin tins. Bake 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of muffins comes out clean. Makes 12 muffins.

CASCO BAY REPORT LACKS CALL TO ARMS FOR MORE CLEANUP THE GOOD NEWS:IT'S HEALTHY FOR NOW. THE BAD: IT STILL NEEDS PROTECTION, BUT MONEY AND DEMAND FOR MONITORING MAY DRY UP.

Abstract: Five years ago, Casco Bay seemed to be facing a subtle but growing pollution threat. The concern was great enough, in the political and environmental climate of the time, that the bay was chosen for a national pollution prevention and clean-up study. Five years and $3.5 million later, that study is winding down. For the past few weeks, Portland television, radio and newspaper ads have been publicizing the completion of the Casco Bay Plan and inviting residents to "jump in." Casco Bay was an unusual candidate when it won designation in 1990. Most other estuaries, such as Massachusetts Bay, suffer from obvious problems. Casco Bay was chosen as a model for preventing greater contamination.

Full text:   Five years ago, Casco Bay seemed to be facing a subtle but growing pollution threat. The concern was great enough, in the political and environmental climate of the time, that the bay was chosen for a national pollution prevention and clean-up study.
Five years and $3.5 million later, that study is winding down. For the past few weeks, Portland television, radio and newspaper ads have been publicizing the completion of the Casco Bay Plan and inviting residents to "jump in."
The draft plan is an achievement in itself, but now comes the hard part.
Casco Bay, it turns out, isn't in as bad shape as first suspected. Meanwhile, government money is receding like an outgoing tide.
The plan envisions a new, five-year process of monitoring, mapping, technical assistance and education to protect the bay and clean pockets of pollution. What's unclear now is whether there's enough public interest and government support to do the job.
"Our biggest challenge," says Jeffrey Jordan, South Portland's assistant city manager and management chair of the Casco Bay Estuary Project, "has been that the bay's not on fire."
Casco Bay is one of 28 water bodies that are part of the National Estuary Program. The goal is to protect important bays threatened by pollution.
Casco Bay was an unusual candidate when it won designation in 1990. Most other estuaries, such as Massachusetts Bay, suffer from obvious problems. Casco Bay was chosen as a model for preventing greater contamination.
But Casco Bay is hardly pristine. Nearly 40 percent of its clam flats are closed to harvesting. Certain hot spots of toxic contamination rival those of urban harbors.
Complicating matters is the fact that most of Casco Bay's major pollution sources, such as untreated sewage, were cleaned in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, researchers believe, more than half the pollution comes from scores of diverse sources, such as stormwater running off parking lots and into streams.
So the Casco Bay Estuary Project faced a difficult task.
It had to study the bay and determine just how polluted it is. At the same time, it had to engage residents and officials living throughout a watershed stretching from the White Mountains to Phippsburg. It had to convince them that they are part of a problem that could worsen unless they change the way they maintain roads, fertilize lawns and maintain septic systems.
This sort of message, project participants agree, is a weak call to arms. That makes it hard to gauge public interest in carrying out the plan.
"We're a society that likes to rise to the challenge and solve a crisis," says Kevin Gildart, a Bath Iron Works executive who serves on the project's management committee. "We don't like to sit around the fire station. So if the bay's not on fire, it's hard to get people involved."
Several methods involved
The estuary project relied on several methods to involve local residents, fund programs and develop its plan.
The project is overseen by a 12-member management committee. Advisory groups represent local government, technical experts and residents. The process has included several public forums and focus groups to help set priorities and comment on proposed actions.
The project budgeted $1.6 million for studies and research on the state of Casco Bay. Experts examined issues such as the toxic contaminants in underwater sediments and the economic value of clam flats. They mapped the bay with computers and satellites.
To involve communities, the project funneled $480,000 to local officials for demonstration programs. These efforts ranged from tracing shellfish pollution sources in Freeport to managing stormwater in Cape Elizabeth.
The project also published newsletters, ran boat tours and created other educational material. This public information campaign cost $582,000, including $164,000 spent on the recent media blitz.
Roughly $665,000 went to pay staff salaries and run the project's Portland office. Another $133,000 was spent writing and printing the 217-page plan.
Most of the money, roughly $3 million, came from the federal government. State money and in-kind contributions, such as town participation, paid the rest.
Privately, some observers say taxpayer money could have been better spent. Jordan says the process has to be put in perspective.
State and local officials were at odds when the project began in 1990, he says. The state had gone to court to force Portland and South Portland to clean their sewage overflows. Established conservation groups looked at the government-run project with some resentment. And with staff turnover and a change in political administrations during the five years, Jordan says, the project sometimes lacked direction.
A year ago, the management committee hired Patricia Harrington to be the project's first full-time director. A former Portland planner, Harrington is credited with helping the project narrow its focus and create a cohesive plan.
The plan's overall conclusion is that Casco Bay is generally healthy. But it details the kinds of actions that will be needed to keep it that way and improve polluted areas.
The report concentrates on five key areas related to the bay's health: storm-water management, clam flats and swimming, habitat protection, toxic pollution and stewardship of the bay. It sets goals for these areas, suggesting solutions and policies that include public education and regulation. The plan also proposes ways to pay for the ongoing efforts and monitor progress.
Shrinking resources
In an era of shrinking resources, the plan will need plenty of public support to be successful. That support is hard to measure right now.
The plan got its first public reaction last weekend at a meeting in Brunswick. Roughly 100 people turned out. Almost as many people came to a similar session Thursday in Portland.
But despite the attendance and media campaign, reaction to the plan has been modest. Few written comments have come in to the project, Harrington says.
That lack of public feedback concerns Joseph Payne, executive director of The Friends of Casco Bay, a 1,000-member environmental group.
"I don't know anyone who doesn't support the plan," Payne says. "The question is, who knows about it?"
Harrington says she hopes the ads raise public awareness. More critical, she says, is winning the support of local officials, such as planning board members and public works directors. These are the people who decide where homes go up and how roads shed stormwater.
Stormwater runoff is the single greatest pollution source in the bay. That's why the project calculated the $11 million or more generated each year by the softshell clam industry. In helping officials in watershed towns control storm flows and septic pollution, Harrington hopes they see the link between economic growth and protecting the bay.
"They are going to be the bridge to working on these things," she says.
Beyond support, carrying out any plan will take money. But it's unclear how much it will cost and where the money will come from.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency has pledged $200,000 a year through the decade, but it must be approved by a volatile Congress. The state Department of Environmental Protection is expected to provide $90,000 a year. But with the budget shortfall in Augusta, the state is already holding back money earmarked for this year.
Counting on these government contributions, the plan has budgeted roughly $700,000 a year. It hopes to make up the difference through fund raising and charging fees for services such as computerized mapping.
The most important work, all parties agree, is to carry out a monitoring program. That will cost roughly $155,000. The program would analyze stormwater, track clam flats, monitor swimming beaches and test water quality, among other things. Baseline, scientific information on the bay is crucial to knowing whether its health is improving or getting worse over time.
Harrington says the financial goals are realistic. She is reluctant to discount anticipated money sources or label some efforts, such as a $40,000 task to research the impact of tax codes on habitat conservation, as nonessential.
"I don't want to ratchet down expectations," she says.
But Payne and others say the plan should focus on what is absolutely essential and affordable in today's political climate.
"Instead of saying, `Here's what we'd like to do for $700,000,' " Payne says, "they should say, `This is what you can hold our feet to the fire for.' "
Payne's remarks are echoed by Mike Herz, who was involved with the estuary project in San Francisco Bay and now works on conservation issues in Maine's Penobscot Bay. The dilemma in Casco Bay is to be expected, Herz says. Nationally, almost all the estuary projects with active plans are struggling to carry them out, because they are too costly or lack support.
A common problem, he says, is that government-sponsored projects retain a bureaucratic structure that could be better replaced by local agencies and volunteer groups. He cites Payne's group, which receives money from the project to help run a water quality monitoring program, as a logical choice.
This kind of discussion is bound to take place as the Casco Bay plan moves from a draft to its final shape. The final plan must be approved by Gov. Angus King and Carol Browner, head of the EPA.
THE WATERSHED
The land and streams that drain into Casco Bay cover 985 square miles and 41 communities. The watershed reaches from Cape Elizabeth to Phippsburg on the coast, and west to the White Mountains in Bethel.
The bay covers 200 square miles. It has 578 miles of shoreline, including 785 islands and exposed ledges.
Twelve large lake and river systems feed the bay. They include Sebago Lake and the Presumpscot, Royal, Stroudwater and Fore rivers.
A quarter of Maine's population lives in the watershed, although it covers only 3 percent of the state's land mass.
OBTAINING COPIES
Copies of the Casco Bay Plan are available from the Casco Bay Estuary Project, 312 Canco Road, Portland, 04103. The plan is also at local libraries or can be located by calling 828-1043.
Comments can be mailed to the project's office or faxed to 828-4001.

Abstract: Portland-area residents got a chance Thursday to see the results of a five-year study of Casco Bay and learn about a plan to protect and clean it in the future. They learned that Casco Bay is generally healthy. But the future well-being of the 200-square-mile water body will rest with thousands of small decisions, such as how often people pump their septic systems and the way towns as far away as Bethel build homes and roads. "It's your resource," said Kevin Gildart, a Bath Iron Works executive who serves on the management committee of the Casco Bay Estuary Project. "It's your money and it's your health."

Full text:   Portland-area residents got a chance Thursday to see the results of a five-year study of Casco Bay and learn about a plan to protect and clean it in the future.
They learned that Casco Bay is generally healthy. But the future well-being of the 200-square-mile water body will rest with thousands of small decisions, such as how often people pump their septic systems and the way towns as far away as Bethel build homes and roads.
"It's your resource," said Kevin Gildart, a Bath Iron Works executive who serves on the management committee of the Casco Bay Estuary Project. "It's your money and it's your health."
Gildart and the committee presented the report on Casco Bay to roughly 75 people at a meeting in Portland. About 100 people turned out at a similar session last weekend in Brunswick.
The estuary project is part of a government-funded program to combat pollution in significant bays around the country. The Casco Bay project has finished drafting its plan. It concludes years of studies, demonstration programs and public participation.
Now the project is poised to carry out measures proposed in its draft plan, a series of ways to measure the health of the bay and devise ways to protect it. A final plan will be sent to Gov. Angus King and Carol Browner, head of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
The 217-page report concentrates on five key areas related to the bay's health: storm-water management, clam flats and swimming, habitat protection, toxic pollution and stewardship of the bay.
It sets goals for these areas, suggesting solutions and actions that include public education and regulation. The plan also proposes ways to pay for the ongoing efforts and monitor progress.
The project found big improvements in the handling of storm water since the 1970s, largely because of sewage treatment. But it also noted that the number of homes built within the bay's lower watershed has almost doubled in 20 years. Erosion and runoff from that development pose a complex problem and one of the biggest challenges in improving water quality.
Some additional progress has been made in cleaning Casco Bay during the past five years, the committee said. Demonstration grants have helped area towns manage stormwater, for example, and an extensive water monitoring program is in place. Roughly 20 shellfish harvesting areas, most in Yarmouth, Freeport and Harpswell, have reopened.
But more than a third of the bay's clam flats remain closed, so the cleanup focus must now shift to the 41 communities throughout the watershed. Most of today's pollution, the plan's report says, comes from diffuse sources - oil running off roadways, faulty septic systems, home pesticides and farming practices, among others.
The plan proposes to help instill a sense of stewardship in local residents so they become aware of how their actions and behaviors affect water quality. To achieve all this, the plan proposes a range of possible actions:
Publicity campaigns would raise awareness among homeowners and boaters. A demonstration sitewould be created to show how vegetation can control storm-water runoff. In addition, the report said a "state of the bay" conference could be held.
Schools would play a key role, with younger children learning about the bay and older students contributing to research.
"If we can get to our children," Gildart said, "I think we're going to make some tremendous progress." ___________________________________________________________________

Abstract: Day in and out, workers at Cozy Harbor Seafoods ask and answer these questions. The routine is the essence of a new seafood inspection system that the Food and Drug Administration has announced will be mandatory for fish processors nationwide starting next year. Maine processors interviewed Wednesday reacted to the new regulations with what amounts to a shrug. Many, like Cozy Harbor, already have put new inspection systems into place, or are well on the way to doing so. The new federal system, given the clunky name Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, has processors identifying important checkpoints in the flow of seafood through their plants. Workers keep records of their observations, which cumulatively give the plant a diary of the whole process.

Full text: How clear are those fish's eyes? Is the temperature of the cooler consistently below 35 degrees? Are the shrimp being cooked getting hot enough for long enough?
Day in and out, workers at Cozy Harbor Seafoods ask and answer these questions. The routine is the essence of a new seafood inspection system that the Food and Drug Administration has announced will be mandatory for fish processors nationwide starting next year.
Maine processors interviewed Wednesday reacted to the new regulations with what amounts to a shrug. Many, like Cozy Harbor, already have put new inspection systems into place, or are well on the way to doing so.
"We saw it coming, and it just makes good sense," said John Norton, owner of Cozy Harbor, which has plants in Portland and South Portland.
The new federal system, given the clunky name Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, has processors identifying important checkpoints in the flow of seafood through their plants. Workers keep records of their observations, which cumulatively give the plant a diary of the whole process.
Brian Ward, manager of Sea Fresh USA Inc. in Portland, sums it up this way: "I have trackability of the fish from boat to throat."
The new system will supplement the existing seafood inspection regime, which in Maine is a patchwork involving four state and federal agencies, depending on the product.
An FDA spokesman said his agency inspects processors once every year or two. Under the new system, FDA inspectors should get a much more comprehensive picture of the plant, said Brad Stone.
"It's the difference between seeing a series of snapshots and seeing a movie," he said.
The FDA estimates that 114,000 Americans get sick from bad seafood each year,and that the new program will prevent up to 60,000 of those cases.
Countries in the European Union already require the system, which is why Sea Fresh implemented it about a year ago, Ward said.
Norton of Cozy Harbor said the switch cost his business about $75,000. A food technologist spent six months, full time, writing the company's hazard-analysis plan. Then, employees had to be trained and reporting forms were developed, Norton said.
On the other hand, the program can save money. Peter Fischer, a sales agent at William Atwood Lobster in Spruce Head, said using an in-house quality-control system is less costly than hiring an inspector - an expense of $40 to $60 an hour, which some customers require.
As an industry, seafood processors have been looking at the hazard-analysis system for nearly 10 years, working with the government to develop its use, said Clare Vanderbeek, spokeswoman for National Fisheries Institute, a trade organization in Arlington, Va.
Vanderbeek said about 20 percentof the industry nationwide already uses the new system in some fashion.
If processors have a complaint about the regulation, it's that other seafood handlers down the line don't have to follow it.
But Vanderbeek said retailers are held to an equal standard under its food code, which was announced in January 1994, the same time the FDA proposed the new seafood inspection system.
That leaves the consumer.
Bob Young, a shellfish processor and retailer in Belfast, recounted the time a customer complained that he'd sold her spoiled crab. He asked her where she went after she left his store.
"This woman went to the hair salon, and then she went shopping, and then she went to brunch, and then she went home. She was here at 8:30, and got home at a quarter to one," Young said.
And no, she did not put the crab in a cooler meanwhile.
"She was under the assumption that because it was that fresh, it didn't have to be refrigerated," he said.
INFORMATION AVAILABLE
A free brochure with details about the new mandatory seafood safety system and facts for consumers on the proper handling of seafood is available from: National Fisheries Institute, 1525 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Va. 22209. Send a self-addressed, stamped envelope, and ask for the "HACCP brochure."
Another source of information on safely handling seafood is through the federal Food and Drug Administration's seafood hot line: (800) FDA-4010. The line is staffed from noon to 4 p.m. daily. Recorded information is available 24 hours.

Abstract: The fire was raging on Cliff Island on Monday. Reporters and photographers from the Portland Press Herald and WGME-TV, Channel 13, made it from Portland to the island ferry landing in half an hour. But the fire scene was a mile away, down a dirt road. People at the ferry landing were manning hoses to fill up fire trucks and didn't have time to give the journalists a ride. This winter's storm packs include: Meal 1 - canned macaroni and cheese, mixed vegetables, Ritz crackers, fruit cup and hot cocoa mix; Meal 2 - canned beef stew, apple juice, oyster crackers, fruit cup and hot cocoa mix; Meal 3 - beefy macaroni and cheese in a can, green beans, bread sticks, fruit cup and hot cocoa mix; Meal 4 - Same as Meal 1.

Full text: The fire was raging on Cliff Island on Monday. Reporters and photographers from the Portland Press Herald and WGME-TV, Channel 13, made it from Portland to the island ferry landing in half an hour.
But the fire scene was a mile away, down a dirt road. People at the ferry landing were manning hoses to fill up fire trucks and didn't have time to give the journalists a ride.
What's a reporter on deadline supposed to do? Rely on island hospitality.
"Can you drive a golf cart?" one of the men on the landing asked a reporter.
No problem. The man took the reporting teams to a pickup-style island golf cart, showed them how to work the forward and reverse function, and warned them about the sticky brake pedal.
Reporters went in the cab. Photographers piled in the back. Vroom. Down the dirt road, barely making it up one hill, and to the fire in a few minutes.
Senior meals-on-wheelers
break out thestorm packs
When a snowstorm canceled the Meals on Wheels program both Wednesday and Friday, senior citizens were advised on the radio to use their "storm packs" for meals that day.
Storm packs? The term conjures up images of an Army survival pack, filled with K-rations and cans of Spam. But it's not quite so Spartan. The storm pack, put together by the Southern Maine Area Agency on Aging, is simply a box filled with four meals worth of non-perishable foods in easy-to-open containers.
This winter's storm packs include: Meal 1 - canned macaroni and cheese, mixed vegetables, Ritz crackers, fruit cup and hot cocoa mix; Meal 2 - canned beef stew, apple juice, oyster crackers, fruit cup and hot cocoa mix; Meal 3 - beefy macaroni and cheese in a can, green beans, bread sticks, fruit cup and hot cocoa mix; Meal 4 - Same as Meal 1.
Fred Plimpton, the nutrition program director for the agency, said the storm packs were sent out this fall to the roughly 600 senior citizens in Cumberland and York counties served by the in-home meal program offered to people over 60. Some foods in the pack are meant to be eaten cold, and all are precooked so they can be eaten even if a storm knocks the power out, Plimpton said.
Winslow retirement to see
an era end in Yarmouth
After four decades of running Yarmouth's fire department, the Winslow family's reign is drawing to an end.
Yarmouth Fire Chief Carl Winslow announced this week that he is retiring after 17 years of running the local fire departmentand a total of 44 years as a firefighter. He turned 64 last month.
Winslow took over the chief's job from his father, who had run the department for 27 years and had been a member since 1929.
"The Winslows were in charge of that outfit since the horses were last put to bed," said Town Manager Nathaniel Tupper. Tupper commended Winslow for his service, which will continue until a successor can be chosen.
"He just leaves enormously large shoes for us to fill," Tupper said.
Winslow also was a school teacher and assistant school superintendent before retiring from that post in 1989.
Whistler Cove diggers
undeterred by snowfall
The dusting of snow that coated the ground Wednesday didn't dissuade clam diggers from descending on the newly opened expanse of flats at Whistler Cove in Freeport on the north side of the Cousins River.
The Department of Marine Resources declared the flats conditionally open Tuesday night, and diggers took advantage during Wednesday morning's low tide, said Mick McGivaren, chairman of the town's Shellfish Commission. The 136 acres of flats are ripe for digging because they have been closed to almost all digging for years, he said.
Water quality samples show the flats are healthy. Aggressive water quality testing has led to large areas of mudflats being reopened to digging in the past couple years.
As a conditional area, the Whistler Cove flats will close when more than an inch of rain falls or if Yarmouth's sewage treatment plant malfunctions.

Abstract: Within five minutes of stepping onto Cushing's Island on Thursday, Jeff Tarling spotted trouble. Tarling had found the winter webs of the browntail moth's caterpillars. Moth populations in the Casco Bay area appear to be growing, and that could mean problems next summer. Cushing's Island could be one of several islands that receive aerial spraying with the insecticide Dimilin next May in an effort to control the moths. Peaks, Great Diamond and Little Diamond islands are other potential sites for spraying. But before the city orders spraying, residents must grant their permission.

Full text: Within five minutes of stepping onto Cushing's Island on Thursday, Jeff Tarling spotted trouble.
The city of Portland's arborist found it in a cluster of silver pods wrapped onto the upper twigs of three birch trees.
"They're here," Tarling said with a hint of disappointment. "Before, you had to look at certain trees to find them. The frequency has definitely increased."
Tarling had found the winter webs of the browntail moth's caterpillars. Moth populations in the Casco Bay area appear to be growing, and that could mean problems next summer.
Hardwood trees such as oak, cherry, apple and birch throughout the island are filled with the rubbery, silver caterpillar webs. A large web holds about 300 caterpillars. In the spring, those caterpillars could defoliate many of the trees when they exit the webs to gorge themselves on leaves.
Then, as the caterpillars begin changing into moths, they will shed their tiny, barbed hairs, which carry a toxin similar to bee venom. The toxin causes an itchy rash on humans that can last up to 10 days.
Many islanders who scratched their way through summer this year fear their problems are going to get worse without some help.
"It was tough," said John Donnelly, a Cushing's Island resident. "I don't think there was a person out here who didn't have a rash at some point."
Tarling and Charlene Donahue, an entomologist from the Maine Department of Conservation, hiked across the snow-covered island for an hour Thursday. They found plenty of caterpillar webs to worry Lucy Pederson, who recently moved to Cushing's with her husband, David, to work as year-round caretakers.
"I'm anxious to avoid it next year," she said. "I've heard horror stories from the summer residents. Some of them would be hesitant to come back."
Spraying requires care
Cushing's Island could be one of several islands that receive aerial spraying with the insecticide Dimilin next May in an effort to control the moths. Peaks, Great Diamond and Little Diamond islands are other potential sites for spraying. But before the city orders spraying, residents must grant their permission.
While Dimilin can control browntail moths, it must be used with care. If the chemical gets in the ocean, it can harm lobsters, crabs and other creatures that molt their skins.
The chemical can prevent such shellfish from growing a new skin. If that happens, they die when they molt, Donahue said. Any aerial spraying would be kept at least 100 feet away from the water, she said.
Residents of Cushing's, Great Diamond and Little Diamond have already agreed to spraying. City officials are still counting the signatures from Peaks Island to determine whether they can spray there.
Maine law prevents aerial spraying on anyone's property without permission, so opposition from a few residents could stop a moth control program.
Tarling said he hasn't finished surveying moth populations on the islands, but Cushing's and Peaks islands appear to have the worst infestations.
Portland has sprayed insecticide on Little Diamond Island for three years and Great Diamond Island last year to control the moths. "It's greatly reduced (the moth population), but there's still some out there," Tarling said.
Experts expect outbreak
Browntail moths have been a problem for Mainers for a century.
The small, white moths first came to Massachussetts on some rosebushes shipped from Europe in 1890. By 1916, the peak of moth infestation in New England, they had spread to every county in Maine.
Since that time, the moths had been in steady decline until the mid-1970s, when they were confined to a few Casco Bay Islands, including House and Vail islands. Some entomologists suggest that cold winters and a native fungus helped control the moths.
But by 1989, Maine was enjoying a cycle of milder winters and the moth population was starting to make a comeback. They showed up on Long Island, then spread to other islands and the mainland.
Recent surveys, including Thursday's visit to Cushing's Island, suggest that more scratchy encounters between people and moths are coming, Donahue said. Light infestations have been found from Old Orchard Beach to Chelsea, with heavy infestations on the Casco Bay islands.
"We think they're entering an outbreak phase," she said. "Whatever pressures were keeping the population under control aren't working."
THE BROWNTAIL MOTH
The browntail moth has been a nuisance for Mainers since the early 1900s. It was brought to America from Europe on rosebushes that were shipped to Massachusetts in 1890. By 1916, the moth had spread to every county in Maine.
Moth populations then went into decline until the mid-1970s, when they were confined to a few islands in Casco Bay, including House and Vail islands. Now they can be found from Old Orchard Beach to Chelsea.
The moth is white with a brown abdomen that is tufted with brown hairs. It has a wingspan of about 1.5 inches.
In its caterpillar stage, the browntail is about 1 inch long. The caterpillar is brown mixed with orange and white, and has two brightorange spots on its back. Its many hairs carry a poison that can cause a rash on humans even after the caterpillar has shed them.
The female browntail moth lays about 300 eggs on the leaves of trees and shrubs in July. Caterpillars emerge after two to three weeks and begin to eat. In autumn, when only partly grown, the caterpillars spin small, tough tents of silk at the tips of twigs.
They spend the winter in the tents. In spring, they emerge and begin eating again. When fully grown, the caterpillars spin loose cocoons and change into pupae. They develop into adult moths by July.
The browntail moth belongs to the tussock moth family, Lymantriidae. Its scientific name is Euproctis chrysorrhea.

Abstract: The town plans to reopen Drummore Bay, its last significant clam flat, after signing an agreement with a depuration plant. Drummore Bay, which contains about 90 acres of flats, has been unharvested for more than 40 years, said Robert Cummings, a member of the Phippsburg Shellfish Conservation Committee.

Full text: The town plans to reopen Drummore Bay, its last significant clam flat, after signing an agreement with a depuration plant.
Drummore Bay, which contains about 90 acres of flats, has been unharvested for more than 40 years, said Robert Cummings, a member of the Phippsburg Shellfish Conservation Committee.
Efforts to reopen it stalled last summer when the state tested the meat of some clams there and found unacceptably highlevels of bacteria.
The only way to reopen the flats for digging was to allow a depuration company to control the harvesting. Under the new agreement Wednesday, clam diggers are required to sell clams from Drummore Bay to Spinney Creek Shellfish, an Eliot depuration company, which cleans them before selling them to stores and restaurants.
The clams are washed repeatedly with water treated with ultraviolet light, which kills bacteria. The purified water washes away the bacteria and sand in the clams.
By Phippsburg standards, Drummore Bay is a small clam flat. The town has hundreds of acres of flats in Atkins Bay, Wyman Bay-Parker Head and Parker Flats. But Drummore is the northernmost flat in town, and the last significant one to be opened in a four-year effort to revitalize Phippsburg's shellfish industry.
Under the terms of the one-year agreement, Drummore Bay will be open to harvesting only in January and February. Spinney Creek will give the town 48 hours' notice when it needs a shipment of clams. The company will tell the town's shellfish committee how many clams it needs and how many diggers are needed to harvest them.
Only clam diggers from Phippsburg and West Bath will be eligible to dig in Drummore Bay. If none are available, Spinney Creek can provide its own harvesters.

Abstract: Today, nearing the end of a 20-year career as Brunswick's marine warden, Alan Houston has emerged from the mud as something of a clam-flat star, admired by state legislators, scientists and environmental advocates alike. Even some diggers say he's OK. "I don't think clammers can be impressed by wardens. They're just someone there to play cat-and-mouse with," James MacLeod, a clammer who's become one of Houston's supporters, said with a laugh. Clammers "have more respect for Alan, therefore they have to work harder to get around him." Houston is one of a handful of full-time municipal shellfish wardens in the state, and among the most experienced. He's an important person to have at a time when Maine is recognizing the lost potential of its polluted or otherwise unproductive mud flats, and rising to action.

Full text: He was just a kid when he began - 20 years old, fresh out of technical college with marine sciences in his head.The clam diggers he was hired to watch did their best to humiliate him.
They mouthed off. They slashed the tires of his car. They slung mud on him.
Today, nearing the end of a 20-year career as Brunswick's marine warden, Alan Houston has emerged from the mud as something of a clam-flat star, admired by state legislators, scientists and environmental advocates alike. Even some diggers say he's OK.
"I don't think clammers can be impressed by wardens. They're just someone there to play cat-and-mouse with," James MacLeod, a clammer who's become one of Houston's supporters, said with a laugh. Clammers "have more respect for Alan, therefore they have to work harder to get around him."
Farther from home, people aren't trying to get around Houston. They're hoping, rather, to copy him.
Houston is one of a handful of full-time municipal shellfish wardens in the state, and among the most experienced. He's an important person to have at a time when Maine is recognizing the lost potential of its polluted or otherwise unproductive mud flats, and rising to action.
The state's soft-shell clam industry has been in a slump since 1983. But only recently, amid growing awareness that Maine fisheries from groundfish to urchins are struggling, have marine specialists been inspired by the promise of the unglamorous clam.
This month, the Casco Bay Estuary Project released an analysis of the region's soft-shell clam industry that estimates the economy could gain $3.7 million a year if closed clam beds in Casco Bay alone were made fit to open.
The Gulf of Maine Council has proposed making restoration of shellfish habitat one of its priorities for the next five years.
And representatives from coastal towns will gather Dec. 8 in Rockport for a conference organized by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension to plan a strategy for increasing clam production statewide.
"People are looking up, trying to come to grips (with the problem)," said Houston, who plans to retire from his job inthe coming year.
"We hope there'll be more people like him in time, with good training both in enforcement and management," said Dana Wallace, a shellfish management consultant who worked for 38 years in what is now the state Department of Marine Resources.
Houston became Brunswick's first full-time marine warden in 1976, at a robust time in the state's clamming industry. In 1973, a peak year, the industry employed nearly 6,000 people. They dug up some 7 million pounds of steamers.
Then, flats began closing because of the threat or existence of bacterial pollution, generally from sewage discharges.
By 1994, the clamming work force had shriveled to about 1,650 people, whose collective harvest was 2 million pounds. Though comparatively meager, the harvest fetched $8.8 million - enough money to make soft-shell clams Maine's fourth most valuable commercial marine species.
During the slide, the center of clamming activity shifted. Washington County, the reigning clam producer for nearly 50 years, went into severe decline. In 1991, Cumberland County became the No. 1 clamming county in the state.
Towns such as Brunswick, Freeport, Harpswell and Scarborough were devoting attention to their flats.
When Houston was hired in Brunswick, the town had an ordinance on shellfishing consisting of two paragraphs. "You had to have a license. That was it," Houston said.
Over two decades, the ordinance expanded, as did Houston's duties.
Now, among other things, he: samples water for laboratory testing; inspects shoreline properties for sources of pollution; surveys flats to assess the clam population; marks and posts mud flats to be closed because of pollution or to give shellfish time to multiply; handles licensing; scouts for poachers; writes budgets; applies for grants; and talks to schoolchildren.
Since 1976, Houston said, Brunswick has opened an additional 12 to 15 miles of its coast to clamming. Of the town's 66 miles of shoreline, about 16 remain closed, he said.
Houston's versatility is what most impresses Joe Payne, baykeeper of Casco Bay.
"Alan's a big guy, and he looks kind of gruff, and he has a big gun," Payne said. "The reality is that he is very soft-spoken, and very articulate."
People who have watched him say Houston is as at ease lobbying the state Legislature for laws - such as setting a minimum size for clams to be harvested - as he is inspecting clams on slippery mud.
His years of experience give him clout at the State House. "When Alan's there, why,you know there's somebody there who knows what it's all about," said Rep. Theone Look, R-Jonesboro, a 10-year veteran of the Legislature's Marine Resources Committee.
Through savvy persuasion, Houston got his own town council in 1987 to buy an $18,000 airboat that skims over water, mud and ice with ease. At the time, no other government entity in the state had such a boat.
He demonstrated the craft's usefulness - for things such as saving hours gathering water samples - by leasing it for two months. He took the town councilors for a ride.
"They liked it," he said with a smile and a sly nod.
On the flats, the clammers aren't quite as spellbound. Joseph Toth, who's been digging for as long as Houston's been warden, called the airboat "a joke," because the roar of its propeller sounds a warning to poachers to hide.
In general, Toth said, enforcement lacks bite. "If they've got these areas closed, what they've got to do is patrol it," he said. "(Clammers) know when Alan's got a day off. They know when he's home, or whatever. They'll slide right in on a foggy morning."
In fact, one thing Houston said he regrets about his job is how much time he must spend managing the flats, and how little enforcing the law. It's something he hopes will change as he leaves the warden's job.
As a member of the town police force, Houston, 40, is entitled to retire after 20 years - a milestone he'll reach in the new year. He'll retire because the job, which pays $31,460 a year, keeps him away too much from his wife, Gayle, and 14-year-old son, Scott.
Now the town is training three prospects to replace him. Police Chief Jerry Hinton is considering a proposal to the Town Council to expand the marine resources office, dividing the duties among two or more people.
Only under that condition would Donald Goulet, a trainee, take the job. "I can't do it all by myself," he said.
As the shellfish industry rises among Maine's priorities and the new guys in Brunswick struggle to master a complicated job, it's likely that Houston will have a busy "retirement."
"We've already told Alan, `Don't get your number changed,' " said another trainee, William Collins. "If we take this job, we'll be calling him." "When Alan's there, why, you know there's somebody there who knows what it's all about." Rep. Theone Look, marine resources committee

Full text: A shiny, white vessel that stretched beyond 600 feet and looked like a cruise ship was in the harbor at Portsmouth, N.H., this month on a job to modernize world communications.
The GlobalLink went to Simplex Technologies to fetch a load of undersea fiber optic cable. It was one of the first shipments of material from Simplex for Fiber Loop Around the Globe, a project by Nynex to link countries around the world with the high-tech cable.
Simplex will supply about 12,400 miles of the 18,600-mile network that will link western Europe the Middle East and Asia, said Kerry Briggs, director of new business development for the deep-sea cable manufacturer.
The global project is part of a boom enjoyed by Simplex since the late 1980s as a result of the voracious demand for computers, faxes and telephones, and the circuits that make them possible, Briggs said.
Gulf council takes ideas, sets priorities for action
How does this list of things-to-do sound to you?
Restore shellfish habitats. Promote restoration of groundfish resources. Address ecosystem and public health effects of toxics in the marine food chain. Protect and restore regionally significant coastal habitats. Reduce marine debris and prevent whale entanglement.
These are the things the Gulf of Maine Council proposes to make a priority over the next five years.
About 500 surveys were sent to people on the council's mailing list recently to solicit opinions on the proposed work list. If you didn't get a survey and would like to comment, you can respond to the survey on the Internet through the following address:
http://opal-www.unh.edu/
edims.html
The deadline for comments is Dec. 4.
The Gulf ofMaine Council was created five years ago by the states and provinces of Maine, Massachusetts, New Brunswick, New Hampshire and Nova Scotia to deal with gulf issues that cross political boundaries.
The panel's original priority areas were more vague than those it is considering now. The old areas were: monitoring and research; coastal and marine pollution; habitat protection; education and participation; and protection of public health.
It has acted on its goals partly by giving money to local groups - such as the Portland Harbor Marine Debris Council - as well as by organizing workshops, producing educational posters and contributing to reports.
No foul play found in cases of dead seals
The mystery of the dead, sometimes mutilated, seals washing on Maine shores looks to remain a mystery, at least for now.
"It's been a long time since we heard anything about it," said Lt. Russell Davidson, spokesman for the Coast Guard's Group Portland.
Back in June and July, law enforcement officials fielded some 20 reports of dead seals washing up on beaches between Portsmouth, N.H., and Port Clyde. Some of the animals were headless.
Marine mammal specialists said the mutilation could be the work of scavengers and natural decomposition. Still, federal law enforcement agents kept an eye out for possible foul play - such as lobstermen killing seals that raided bait bags in their traps.
"We could never figure out if it was a natural thing or seals getting too close to lobster pots," Davidsonsaid. "It just kind of quieted down."
Council to decide details for limiting fishing days
They're getting down to the wire. After more than a year of anguished deliberations, the New England Fishery Management Council is close to completing its strategy for rebuilding severely depleted stocks of cod, haddock and yellowtail flounder.
The group already has decided that the principal controlling factor will be limiting the days fishermen are allowed to fish. Details are being hashed out in committee meetings, the next of which is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Holiday Inn on Route 1 in Peabody, Mass.
That might be the last meeting of the panel before it votes, possibly in December, on a final plan.
FACES ON THE WATERFRONT
Name: Bill Sawyer
Occupation: Winter manager of Benny's restaurant
Location: Portland
Job description: Sawyer steeps in the aroma of fried seafood as he keeps his brother Benny's restaurant running year-round. Though summer is definitely the busy season for this roadside stand with the outdoor deck, winter lunches remain hectic, attracting some 50 regulars. Benny's stands alone on West Commercial Street, but its location is far from quiet.
Quote: "I sat here one day and counted cars. In one hour, I counted 1,260 cars. It's a good spot."

Full text: In 1874, A.E. Verrill found quahogs and American oysters in Back Cove and the Fore River. Today, the fabled shellfish are found only in seafood restaurants on Maine's waterfront, and more than a third of Casco Bay's clam flats have been closed to harvesting.
That tells the story of Casco Bay better than any amount of literature. Still, the bay is relatively clean, and relatively productive, and the bay and its watershed remain Cumberland County's most valuable natural resource.
For the past four years, the Casco Bay Estuary Project has been studying how to keep it that way. In the process, the federally funded study, one of 16 around the country, has sought ways to prevent further pollution of the type that already has degraded the bay. A measureof the project's success will be how rapidly those clam flats reopen.
The Casco Bay Plan that has emerged focuses on five areas of concern: storm-water runoff, toxic pollutants, clam flats and swimming areas, habitat protection and effective stewardship. The public will have the opportunity to comment on the 217-page plan at meetings Dec. 2 in Brunswick and Dec. 7 in Portland. (Call 828-1043 for more information.)
"Casco Bay lies at the heart of Maine's most populated area," the study begins. "The health of its waters, wetlands and wildlife depend - in large part - on the activities of the quarter-million residents who live in its watershed." From Bethel to the sea, those residents now have the chance to speak up and save their bay.

Abstract: Clammers in Harpswell and Brunswick are waiting anxiously for the completion of a study that will determine the location of the border separating the two communities. At stake are about 700 acres of prime clam flats. Brunswick clammers claim the flats are theirs, but some Harpswell residents say law books from the 1700s show the flats are actually in Harpswell. The study by a Topsham land-surveying firm has been under way since May. Harpswell Selectman Ron Johnson said it might be finished by next week.

Full text: Clammers in Harpswell and Brunswick are waiting anxiously for the completion of a study that will determine the location of the border separating the two communities.
At stake are about 700 acres of prime clam flats. Brunswick clammers claim the flats are theirs, but some Harpswell residents say law books from the 1700s show the flats are actually in Harpswell.
The study by a Topsham land-surveying firm has been under way since May. Harpswell Selectman Ron Johnson said it might be finished by next week.
"It's keeping people on edge," Johnson said. "And the longer they are on edge, the better the chance is that feelings will flare up."
Jim MacCleod's feelings are already flaring. He's been a clammer for 40 years and serves as the chair of Brunswick's Marine Resources Committee. He said Harpswell is trying to steal Brunswick's clams.
"There are thousands of bushels of harvestable clams out there, and I think this is just a land grab by greedy individuals who think they may profit from this," MacLeod said.
But Johnson said all he wants to do is follow the correct process for determining the town line.
"If we didn't look intoit citizens in our town would say, `What are these knuckleheads doing giving up 700 acres of clam flats?,' " Johnson said.
The boundary in question is a 10-mile section running from Mere Point to the New Meadows River. Current maps show the line running a few hundred yards offshore in critical clamming areas such as Merepoint Bay and Middle Bay, placing the clam flats there in Brunswick.
But some historical documents have been found that may contradict the maps. The documents seem to place the town line along the shore, shifting the flats into Harpswell.
The issue surfaced in the spring of 1994 when Harpswell pulled out of a 20-year-old shellfishing agreement with Brunswick and West Bath. Under the agreement the exact location of the town line wasn't critical, because clam flats in all the towns were open to clammers in all the towns.
But Harpswell pulled out of the agreement because it felt it had the best clam flats and therefore was losing out by opening its flats to the other towns.
With the agreement dissolved, only Harpswell clammers can dig on Harpswell's clam flats. The towns want to place precise markers on the clam flats to determine where clammers from each town can dig.
Last spring Brunswick and Harpswell officials hired the Topsham firm, Dirigo Land Services Inc., to set the line where the markers should be placed. At the time they tentatively agreed that markers would follow the long-accepted town line that runs down the middle of Merepoint Bay and Middle Bay.
But in the last few months some Harpswell residents have been digging into old law books to see if the town line is accurate.
George Barnes, a land surveyor from Harpswell, found a document from 1739 that he says places the town line along the shore rather than in the middle of the bays. The document is a bill from the General Court of Massachusetts, which at the time governed the area.
Barnes said that despite extensive research, he has not been able to find any legal document produced since that bill that shifts the town line into the middle of the bays.
"The first reference to the town line says that it follows the shore, and we don't see anything that changes that," Barnes said. "So I would say it's still there."
That evidence helped convince the Harpswell selectmen last month to direct Dirigo Land Services to include a historical study in its efforts to determine the town line.
The selectmen's action contradicted their tentative agreement with Brunswick to have the surveyor follow the town line down the middle of the bays.
Johnson said he felt obligated to explore the historical evidence to determine an accurate town line. He said he thinks the issue can be resolved amicably.
In Brunswick, the Harpswell selectmen's decision to pursue the historical evidence heightened the tension over the issue.
"The towns agreed to use the line that is currently on the maps," said Alan Houston, Brunswick's marine warden. "We have been using this as the line for years, and we feel confident that in the end the town line will be where we agreed it should be."

Full text: Fresh off a banner year for shrimping, New England fishermen will be allowed this winter to catch shrimp for six full months - the longest season in five years.
For an industry besieged nowadays by more restrictive government rules, news on the shrimp front was cheered Tuesday - but not without nagging doubts. Some people wonder whether the promise of another great shrimp harvest will lead to overfishing and whether this year's longer season will come at the expense of future seasons.
In these days of declining fisheries, fishermen, managers and scientists do not greet good news without looking over their shoulders nervously.
On Tuesday, about 150 shrimp fishermen and processors told their worries to shrimp managers from the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, who met in Portland to establish the length of and rules for the new shrimp season.
The managers, coming from Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, decided to allow shrimp fishing Dec. 1 to May 31 from dragger boats, with fishing prohibited one day a week, and Jan. 1 to May 31 for trappers.
Their decision came after a scientist reported that last winter's harvest was abundant beyond expectations and that the Gulf of Maine shrimp population remains robust.
Compared with other management decisions in troubled fisheries, the shrimp ruling came quickly - but not breezily.
"You no longer come into this room and manage (just) shrimp," observed Craig Pendleton, a Portland fishing-boat owner and treasurer of the Portland Fish Exchange. "We have so many things to worry about."
Foremost in their minds is the potential for boats driven from the depleted groundfishery to hunt other species.
Shrimp fishermen worried about that last year, too. But a scientific assessment of the shellfishery reported little evidence of the so-called displaced effort.
Jim Fossett of South Bristol and other fishermen said they don't believe there are enough boats in the fleet to harm the shrimp population. Others argued that the danger is becoming more probable with imminent severe regulations to restore groundfish.
"Any fishery that's successful in this atmosphere is going to draw new applicants," said Dean Tsonas, a fisherman from Hampton Falls, N.H. "People are grasping for ways to stay in the industry."
If shrimp are fished harder this winter than last year, this sweet fishery could quickly turn sour, warned Dan Schick, a biologist in the state Department of Marine Resources.
"It's not a giant fishery," Schick said. "It will not withstand a stupendous increase in effort."
Steve Clark, a fishery biologist from the National Marine Fisheries Service, said New England fishermen catch somewhere between 10 percent and 30 percent of legal-sized shrimp - a sustainable level.
"Right now it isn't broke, but it could get broke in a hurry," Clark said.
Against the flow of other fishermen and processors who spoke out - many advocating a full six-month season with no closed days - one man argued for less fishing.
Proctor Wells, a fisherman from Phippsburg, said the design of last winter's successful season, which lasted five months, should be preserved.
"I'd rather see them, at a point when things look pretty good, be conservative to make sure we have stocks later," Wells said. ____________________________________________________________________ _____

BANNER YEAR
Last winter, Maine fishermen caught more than 11 million pounds of shrimp, worth $10.3 million. It was the biggest catch in 22 years.
It was a sharp increase over the year before, when 4.9 million pounds of shrimp, worth $3.8 million, were landed in Maine ports.
The all-time high was recorded in 1969, when 24 million pounds were harvested.

Abstract: The Army Corps of Engineers says it will not issue a permit for the proposed Sears Island cargo terminal unless the state redesigns the controversial project. The corps says the state's plan to pile solid fill into Penobscot Bay to support the terminal wharf and cargo handling area would inflict too much damage on the marine environment. The corps says the state should build the wharf on pilings. The corps' position, conveyed in a Nov. 7 letter to Department of Transportation Commissioner John C. Melrose, marks a pivotal point in the project's long history. It is the first time the federal agency has said the project cannot be approved.

Full text: The Army Corps of Engineers says it will not issue a permit for the proposed Sears Island cargo terminal unless the state redesigns the controversial project.
The corps says the state's plan to pile solid fill into Penobscot Bay to support the terminal wharf and cargo handling area would inflict too much damage on the marine environment. The corps says the state should build the wharf on pilings.
The corps' position, conveyed in a Nov. 7 letter to Department of Transportation Commissioner John C. Melrose, marks a pivotal point in the project's long history. It is the first time the federal agency has said the project cannot be approved.
Unless MDOT can meet the concerns, the state either will have to relocate the project to a less environmentally sensitive site or abandon it altogether.
MDOT has previously estimated that building on pilings would add $16 million to the cost of the project, making it economically unfeasible.
But Melrose said Tuesday the state is studying the issue and expects to have new cost estimates within a week. "That may well lead to an alternative design," he said.
Melrose said he was optimistic that the department could satisfactorily address the environmental concerns and other issues raised by the project.
The state wants to build the cargo terminal on the western shore of the 940-acre island. The terminal would serve shippers in central and northern Maine.
MDOT says the port would handle about 716,500 tons of cargo a year, including wood chips, paper and other forest products, andvarious containerized goods.
The major environmental impacts to the island under MDOT's proposed design include filling 13 acres of freshwater wetlands and 25 acres of marine bottom below high tide.
Much of the ocean area that would be lost includes shellfish beds and valuable breeding and nursery habitat for fish and other marine life.
Ironically, the corps twice approved the Sears Island site in the 1980s, allowing MDOT to build a causeway and access road to the island.
But the work was halted by court challenges from the Maine chapter of the Sierra Club, which prompted fresh environmental studies and the discovery of 200 acres of previously unreported wetlands on the island.
Last summer, MDOT filed a supplemental environmental statement with new project designs to take those wetlands into account.
Christine Godfrey, a corps staff member, said the agency couldn't give MDOT a new permit because the environmental damage is much broader than was known in the 1980s.
In its Nov. 7 letter to Melrose, the corps said the impacts were unprecedented among the projects reviewed for permits in New England.
"It is important that you understand," wrote William F. Lawless, chief of the corps' New England regulatory division, that "the current proposal . . . is simply environmentally unacceptable and cannot receive a permit."
Lawless pointed out that, as a rule, major new marine projects are not built on solid fill. He urged MDOT to develop a design based on pilings.
MDOT evaluated such designs in its draft supplemental environmental impact statement.
A piling design was not selected as the preferred alternative, MDOT said, because the price was too high.
In an Oct. 20 letter to the corps, Melrose estimated that a Sears Island design using pilings would cost $95.5 million, including the expense of compensating for environmental damage.
"Not only is that level of expenditure beyond the capability of the state," Melrose wrote, ". . . but current information indicates that the environmental gain associated with these extraordinary expenditures would be marginal at best."
In an interview Tuesday, however, Melrose said MDOT has asked for new engineering studies to re-evaluate its cost estimates for the project.
He said he would meet with corps representatives and Gov. Angus King's chief of staff, Charles Hewett, in Augusta Nov. 22 to discuss the corps' concerns.
King, an ardent supporter of the Sears Island terminal, wants Hewett to gather firsthand information about the issues, Melrose said.
Melrose said the state questions whether the corps and other federal agencies are properly weighing the environmental impacts against the costs and economic benefits of the Sears Island project.
In his October letter to the corps, Melrose noted that Sears Island will be two or three times as costly, per ship berth, as recent port projects in Eastport and Portsmouth, N.H.
But Lawless said Melrose was misinterpreting federal guidelines for evaluating reasonable costs. He said costs in Portsmouth and Eastport were lower because infrastructure features like roads and utility lines were already in place.
The state has taken the position that $60 million is the most it could afford for Sears Island. Despite the apparent difficulty staying within that figure, Melrose said he was optimistic MDOT was making progress overcoming environmental and other concerns raised by critics.
It is unclear how soon the issues raised by the corps will be settled.
MDOT is still preparing its final environmental impact statement on the project, and the corps would take at least 30 days after the statement is submitted to act on a permit.
The corps' decision on the permit will then be subject to review by the Environmental Protection Agency. Under federal law, EPA can veto the permit if it believes the project will cause too much environmental damage.
In its own review of the project, EPA said last month the environmental impacts were significant.
But the agency's regional administrator, John DeVillars, said public agencies and private groups should work together to find a way to offset those impacts.

Full text: Fat Atlantic salmon break the ocean's surface off Gove Point on a bright autumn afternoon. One by one, the 100,000 fish spiral out of the water and belly-flop back into their huge cages linked by steel walkways and moored to the ocean floor.
The salmon entered the cages 18 months ago weighing just a few ounces. Now, at 8 to 10 pounds apiece, they're ready for the "white tablecloth" market of the East Coast.
With fish stocks declining and commercial fishermen struggling with more government-imposed limits, farm-raised fish are becoming increasingly important to Maine's economic future and the nation's diet.
Aquaculture - the controlled raising of fish, shellfish and seaweed - has evolved into a $43 million-a-year industry in Maine. Production of Atlantic salmon, the primary product of Maine aquaculture, rose from 1 million pounds in 1988 to 13.5 million pounds in 1994.
Aquaculture employs roughly 500 Mainers and serves as an economic pillar in Down East towns such as Lubec, where a sign welcomes visitors to "the beginning of America," the eastern-most town in the United States.
Steven A. Swartz, standing on the Lubec waterfront, can see at least eight U.S. and Canadian fish farms in Cobscook Bay, the heart of Maine's aquaculture industry.
A top executive for one of Maine's larger salmon companies, Swartz sees aquaculture as a natural progression from "wild harvest" fishing, not unlike the taming of the Western range country into ranches.
"We've gone through the years of harvesting fish out of the ocean," Swartz said. "We've got climactic changes, environmental changes. We've got to look to aquaculture. There's tremendous potential."
State officials and industry experts agree Maine aquaculture is likely to grow in importance and visibility. It is mentioned frequently as a developing part of the state's economy and possible alternative for commercial fishermen forced out of work.
Gov. Angus King is among aquaculture's biggest boosters. He told a gathering of commercial fishermen: "I'm not going to con you - I think aquaculture is a big part of the future of this state."
Maine has about 18 salmon farms, 10 shellfish aquaculture firms (which, unlike salmon companies, tend to be small) and one that grows nori, a seaweed that is pressed like paper and exported to Japan, where it is used to wrap sushi.
Robin Alden, Maine's commissioner of marine resources, said further development of aquaculture makes sense given the state's assets of clean water, thousands of miles of coastline and residents used to making their living on the water.
Preserving an industry
But Alden said aquaculture should continue to supplement - not replace - Maine's commercial fishing industry.
"People tend to write off commercial fishing and say it's over," Alden said. "It's not. But I think we can add to it and have an equally powerful aquaculture industry."
Indeed, D.E. Salmon off North Lubec, one of Swartz's companies, is a case in point. As the Atlantic salmon swim in their pens, a fishing boat paces offshore.
The state has ruled that aquaculture operations can't displace traditional fishing. Nor can draggers violate a 300-foot buffer around fish farms.
Yet many fishermen see aquaculture as competition. That - and the fact that the two businesses have little in common - means it's unlikely hordes of fishermen will seek work in aquaculture.
"It is really different," said Michael Hastings, executive director of the Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center in Brewer. "The only thing that is really the same (with aquaculture) is it's on the water and you have to take a boat to get" to the fish pens.
Indeed, aquaculturists like Swartz are more likely to compare themselves to farmers than fishermen.
The Oakland resident, who has a master's degree in aquaculture, oversees the multimillion-dollar operation of three companies - Kennebec Aquaculture, New England Fish Farms and D.E. Salmon.
He particularly relishes hatching salmon eggs and raising young fish. Those early phases, in the case of his Kennebec Aquaculture, occur in Solon, inland on the Kennebec River.
The process is sophisticated and complicated - essentially a controlled re-creation of the way salmon reproduce and grow in the wild. Fish are frequently tested, inspected and vaccinated to ensure disease doesn't stunt or destroy the valuable stocks.
The production of farm-raised salmon begins when workers remove eggs from a female salmon - the average-sized fish can contain 16,000 eggs - and artificially inseminate them with sperm from a male salmon. Then workers coddle the eggs and young fish until they become smolts, meaning they are ready to move from a freshwater environment to the saltwater of ocean pens or cages.
Kennebec Aquaculture produces 875,000 smolts a year, keeping about 200,000 to raise at its farm off Lubec and selling the rest to other companies. This year, the companies also will do some of their own processing in Lubec.
Swartz estimates his companies are in the top three in smolt production in Maine and that the fish farm is among the four or five largest such Maine operations.
An expensive start
Maine salmon farming is dominated by two large firms, Connors Aquaculture and Atlantic Salmon of Maine. Fish farming in Maine hasn't been easy for entrepreneurs to penetrate.
Swartz estimates starting a salmon aquaculture operation could cost $7 million to $8 million. Then the investor must wait several years before realizing any return.
"You have to be in for the long run," Swartz said.
A number of Maine aquaculture firms rely on foreign investors, including Canadians and Norwegians. Swartz's company has Scottish backers, he said.
International competition also deters small operators. Maine salmon farmers cite it - not fish diseases or the fickle Maine weather - as their primary concern. The competitor they worry most about today is Chile.
The state's fish farmers in 1994 produced about half the nation's domestic farm-raised Atlantic salmon production for the year. The other big producer of domestic farm-raised salmon is Washington state. But imports of farm-raised salmon into the United States have been growing rapidly.
Maine's salmon production actually dropped last year by about 1.3 million pounds, or about 8 percent, and has been flat for three years. Hastings cites hitra, a fish disease precipitated by extremely low water temperatures, as a reason for last year's decline.
Because salmon farming is tough to enter and competitive, and because much of the coast is not suited for it, Hastings thinks much of the future growth in aquaculture will come in other segments of the industry. Among them: nori, expansion of shellfish aquaculture and development of aquaculture products for biotechnology.
Ironically, aquaculture could even help the wild fishing industry. Several Maine farms are experimenting with raising cod and other groundfish that could someday replenish wild stocks.
Swartz said he hopes wild fish rebound. But, he said, "I think it's going to be difficult. If it does (happen), it's going to be a lot of years."
In the meantime, he envisions a day when fish farms will be seen as just as fundamental to the Maine coast as lobster boats.

AQUACULTURE SEEN AS `SAVIOR' FOR FISHING IN MAINE, FARM-RAISED SALMON IS ALREADY THE STATE'S SECOND MOST ABUNDANT FISH CROP.

Abstract: For more than 2,000 years, the Chinese have gotten much of their fish through farming. But in the United States - particularly the New England region - fish farming, or aquaculture, is relatively new. Now, as the traditional fishing industry here reaches dire straits, some experts say aquaculture deserves a closer look. Massachusetts was the fifth largest aquaculture producer in the Northeast in 1992 with $8 million in sales out of a total of $146 million for the region. Quahogs, oysters, trout, hybrid striped bass, scallops, bait fish and tilapia, a freshwater fish, are all now being farm raised in the Bay State.

Full text: For more than 2,000 years, the Chinese have gotten much of their fish through farming. But in the United States - particularly the New England region - fish farming, or aquaculture, is relatively new.
Now, as the traditional fishing industry here reaches dire straits, some experts say aquaculture deserves a closer look.
"Aquaculture has been touted as kind of the savior for the fishing community and I think in some ways it could be," said Sebastian Belle, a researcher at the New England Aquarium.
The aquarium, along with the Legal Seafoods restaurant chain and an ocean education group, are trying to promote the aquaculture industry.
Gregory Stone, director of conservation programs at the aquarium, said fishermen must look beyond the temporary fishing restrictions that have been imposed and find alternatives to traditional fishing.
Sections of the once-fertile Georges Bank have been shut down to fishermen over the last year.
According to Belle, aquaculture is now the fastest growing segment of agricultural production in the United States, but is significantly smaller - and technologically behind - countries like China, Japan and Norway.
Most of the aquaculture growth in the United States has come within the last 10 years, although trout and catfish have been farm-raised in the South and Midwest for about 20 years, Belle said.
In Maine, farm-raised salmon is the state's second most abundant fish crop at 7,000 tons a year, behind lobster at 18,000 tons.
Massachusetts was the fifth largest aquaculture producer in the Northeast in 1992 with $8 million in sales out of a total of $146 million for the region. Quahogs, oysters, trout, hybrid striped bass, scallops, bait fish and tilapia, a freshwater fish, are all now being farm raised in the Bay State.
In 1992 Connecticut had $61 million in aquaculture sales, primarily from oysters.
Global aquaculture production is around 16 million tons, said Thor Lassen, president of Ocean Trust, an education and preservation foundation based in Alexandria, Va. That figure more than doubled from 1984, he said.
Critics of aquaculture have said the fish farms - which often raise more than 100,000 fish at a time - are health and pollution hazards. The fish, which must be fed frequently, also defecate frequently, and much of that waste flows out of their pens and into the surrounding waters.
Typically, sea-water fish farms are areas of the ocean fenced off by nets.
The aquarium plans to host a series of forums this fall to examine the feasibility of aquaculture, which includes freshwater and sea-water farming, in the region. According to Stone, not every area can farm raise every kind of fish. The temperatures in Cape Cod Bay, for example, are too warm for salmon.
The discussions come not a moment too soon, said Lassen, who noted that fish shortages are reaching critical levels around the world.
"When we look at what the food needs are going to be for the world as population continues to grow, we can see there will be a shortage on a per capita basis," he said.
And while aquaculture is an answer, Lassen cautioned it's not the only one.
Roger Berkowitz, president of Legal Seafoods, said he is concerned about where he will buy fish for his 11-restaurant chain in the future.
Until recently, he said, a vast majority of the fish he sells came from the North Atlantic.
With fish consumption on the rise - it's now at 15.2 pounds per person compared to around 14 pounds a year ago - "you really have to look at other alternatives," he said.
Belle said many traditional fishermen have viewed aquaculture as a threat to their own product. But as the number of out-of-work fishermen increases, more and more are seeing it as a potential savior, he said.
"Fishermen in this country face a choice of either using the technique or they're going to be at the mercy of the ups and downs of fish stocks," he said.
With aquaculture, he added, "you have some degree of control."
Tony Verga, a state representative from Gloucester and a former fisherman, said fishermen have become increasingly receptive to the idea.
"It will never become the replacement of the fishing industry, but it is an alternative to the fishing that we see today," he said.
