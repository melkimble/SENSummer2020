# SENSummer2020
This Graduate Pursuit aims to explore the role of narratives within social-ecological system dynamics. We define these social-ecological narratives as the stories through which communities understand their interactions and co-dependencies with an ecological system. Social-ecological systems (SES) research recognizes the importance of understanding relationships within and between systems (Liu et al., 2007; McGinnis & Ostrom, 2014; Ostrom, 2009). While SES research has made great strides in linking natural sciences and social sciences, the integration of cultural factors dealt with by the humanities has occurred more slowly. The persistence of this gap is partly due to methodological challenges. Many of the sources indicative of cultural dynamics are seen as messy and interpreted in a way that is difficult to synthesize with traditional formats of ecological and more quantitative social data (Himes-Cornell, Maguire, Kasperski, Hoelting, & Pollnac, 2016; Lyons, Carothers, & Reedy, 2016). 

To address this gap, we propose to a) define and explore the concept of a “social-ecological narrative” and its role within a social-ecological system; b) refine methods for data integration and analysis across natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities--in particular the processing of under-utilized data from literary sources; and c) apply these approaches to the case-study of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in coastal Maine. We anticipate that the scholarly contributions of concept and method development could be extended beyond the proposed case-study. The insights from this project could help elucidate ongoing discussions that are shaping future coastal systems in Maine and elsewhere (e.g. shifting social dynamics along working waterfronts).

# README.md

A `README.md` file is a very useful component of any project
repository; it is the first file that unfamiliar users will open to
learn about your project. If this course uses GitHub, you will also
notice that the README.md is automatically rendered on GitHub as a
simple "homepage" for your project. Instructions for creating your own
GitHub repository from these files may be given during the course. The
same instructions are also summarized in [CONTRIBUTING.md].

## Data

If this project does not contain a data folder, the way to access data
for the worksheets depends on whether you are using RStudio Server and
Jupyter hosted by SESYNC or your own compute resources.

To access the data from a SESYNC hosted environment, open RStudio and
enter the following command at the `>` prompt.

```
file.symlink('https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/104mPe_Bai3wa9ZUN6dEHipeFwov92472?usp=sharing', 'data')
```

Otherwise, download the "data.zip" folder from the course syllabus (if
not currently there, it will be posted after the course), and unzip it
to this "handouts" folder. The result should be a subdirectory called
"data" within this project.
